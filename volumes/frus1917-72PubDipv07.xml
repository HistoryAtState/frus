                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 102-138 added a new Title <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities
                    Act of 1956 (22 <gloss target="#t_USC_1">U.S.C.</gloss> 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government <pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State historians by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Record Administration
                    (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files
                    covering this period are available at Archives II. Almost all of the
                    Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to or are in
                    the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives
                    II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> Presidential Library and
                    other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been
                    declassified, a small number of documents are extracted from still-classified
                    documents. The staff of the Johnson Library is processing and declassifying
                    those documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their
                    entirety at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Johnson Library include some of the most significant
                    foreign-affairs related documentation from White House offices, the Department
                    of State, and other federal agencies including the National Security Council,
                    the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs
                    of Staff.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                        Di<pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>vision. The documents are reproduced
                    as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are
                    described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to
                    accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents within the
                    limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for
                    each document included in this volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words repeated in telegrams to avoid garbling or provide
                    emphasis are silently corrected. Words and phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter
                    of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarized pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provided references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>advises, and makes recommendations
                    concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory
                    Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series
                    and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the
                    series. The Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of
                    individual volumes in the series, but it makes recommendations on issues that
                    come to its attention and reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its
                    advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2016 and was completed in
                    2017, resulted in the decision to withhold one document in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in no documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in one document.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the public diplomacy of the
                    Johnson administration.</p>

                    Relations, Public Diplomacy, 1917-1972</p>
                <p>In 2007, historians at the Office of the Historian proposed a retrospective <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> (<hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi>) volume designed to augment the series’ coverage of U.S. public
                    diplomacy. While the series began to document the subject in a sustained and
                    concerted way starting with the second administration of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard M. Nixon</persName>, previous <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> coverage of U.S. public diplomacy efforts have been far less
                    consistent. These retrospective volumes will fill that gap, stretching from the
                    First World War to the early 1970s. Resource constraints and the statutory
                    requirement to publish <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes 30 years
                    after the events that they cover mean that compilations in this volume have been
                    researched and compiled piecemeal over a longer period of time than the typical
                        <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume. Fortunately, progress is being made.
                    During the fall of 2014, the Office released the first volume covering the U.S.
                    Government’s public diplomacy efforts from 1917 to 1919. With the publication of
                    this volume, the retrospective includes coverage of public diplomacy efforts
                    from 1961 until 1972. Subsequent volumes documenting 1920 to 1960 will be
                    published as they are completed.</p>
                <p> This volume, covering the years 1964 to 1968 focuses on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>’s administration’s efforts
                    to shape and execute public diplomacy and information policy during the middle
                    period of the Cold War. It details the various ways the United States
                    Information Agency (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>) presented U.S.
                    foreign policy objectives to global audiences during a time of great social
                    change within the United States, particularly during the Civil Rights Movement.
                    The compilation also describes how the Johnson administration, through both
                        <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and the Department of State, utilized
                    the various tools of public diplomacy in the face of numerous crises, including
                    the assassination of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F.
                        Kennedy</persName> and transition to the Johnson administration, the
                    Dominican Republic intervention, the ongoing nuclear test-ban treaty
                    negotiations, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and, most significant, the
                    Vietnam War, which was a dominant focus through <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s Presidency. Additional documentation chronicles the
                    Johnson administration’s attempts to reassure the world of U.S. stability
                    following <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s death, to promote a
                    domestic policy during a period of great cultural change, which would greatly
                    impact foreign policy, and to advance the Department of State’s educational
                    exchange activities, particularly with the Soviet Union, and the developing
                    world. The volume should be read in conjunction with <ref target="frus1961-63v25"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1961–1963,

                <p>The National Archives and Records Administration is the key repository for the
                    majority of the important documents related to the Johnson administrations
                    public diplomacy efforts. The single most important source of documentation is
                    Record Group 306, the records of the United States Information Agency (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>)/United States Information Service. These
                    collections are a fertile source of information about <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, the agency in <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s administration specifically tasked with public diplomacy
                    and outreach. The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Historical Collection
                    includes Subject Files (containing records relating to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> function, mission, organization, and programs compiled by
                    former <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> archivist Martin Manning), Office
                    of the Director Files (containing biographical material on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> senior personnel and major speeches), and
                    Reports and Studies Files. The Office of the Director Files is also an excellent
                    source of high-level documentation; particularly useful files include the
                    Director’s Subject Files. The files of the Office of Policy (after 1966 the name
                    changed to Office of Policy and Research), as well as the Research and Reference
                    Service (which was absorbed into the Office of Policy and Research in mid-1966),
                    contain a variety of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> printed products,
                    including the Foreign Opinion Notes, Briefing Papers, Special Reports, and
                    Research Memoranda. Please note that following the completion of the research
                    for this volume, several entry numbers for Record Group 306 have changed,
                    including the following: UD–WW 101, UD–WW 108, and UD–WW 257, which are
                    currently P–331; and UD–WW 151, which is currently UD–WW 379.</p>
                <p>The Presidential papers of <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon Johnson</persName>
                    are another important source of high-level decision making documentation on
                    public diplomacy. A number of collections from the National Security Affairs
                        (<gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss>) files are relevant to research in
                    this area, particularly the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Agency and
                    Vietnam Country files. The <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Leonard Marks</persName>
                    files, in the Office of the President Files, as well as the <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">S. Douglas Cater</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MHC_1">Harry McPherson</persName> files in the Office Files of
                    the White House Aides contain the most relevant public diplomacy documentation.
                    Beyond the National Security Affairs files, the White House Central Files are
                    also an excellent source of documentation on public diplomacy. Additionally, the
                    Subject Files yield substantial material on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> on a wide range of topics.</p>
                <p>Records of the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
                        (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>) also are important to consult on the
                    Johnson administration’s public diplomacy policy-making. Although the bulk <pb n="XII" facs="0013" xml:id="pg_XII"/>of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                    files were transferred to the special collections of the University of Arkansas
                    Libraries in 1983, significant <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> records remain
                    in <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59 at the National Archives. Of the files
                    that remain at the National Archives, the Subject Files in the Records of the
                    Office of the Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs and the
                    Records of the Multilateral Activities of the Secretariat to the U.S. Advisory
                    Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs and to the Advisory
                    Committee on the Arts are especially rich. Among the records housed at the
                    University of Arkansas, the files of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                    Affairs and Cultural Affairs Historical Collection (Manuscript Collection 468),
                    Government Advisory Committee on International Book and Library Programs (Group
                    VII) are of particular interest for this volume. Group VII contains 5 series.
                    Series 4, which contains the Correspondence records of the Chronological Files,
                    yielded revealing documentation on the U.S. Government’s international book and
                    library programs.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                        <p>A December 24 research report entitled “Worldwide Reaction to the First

                            surrounding U.S. global leadership, the report continued: “While

                            the leader of the Free World. The President already has done much to
                            assure the world. He has reaffirmed in several ways and in the most
                            specific manner possible his commitment to the continuation of President

                            which reflects in still one more way the continuity of U.S. policy.
                            There have been enough shifts in emphasis, however, to warrant a
                            restatement of these priorities.</p>
                        <p>There has been and is some confusion as to what these priorities
                            represent and what proportion of our output should be devoted to them.
                            The Agency’s function, stated by the President in a directive of January

                            objectives.” There are, of course, differences among these objectives:
                            some are world-wide in scope, others limited in geographic
                            applicability; some are capable of achievement in a limited time, others
                            will be with us for the foreseeable future. These goals are spelled out
                            specifically in our Country Plans, which continue to be the basis of our
                            operations in the field and support activities in Washington.</p>
                        <p>The diversity of our objectives around the world requires a wide variety
                            of approaches, techniques, and activities. It also requires that we
                            define our priorities, and co-ordinate our activities in support of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The attached priority subjects are those which I consider most urgent at
                            the present time and which should be given full and persuasive treatment
                            in all Media before other subjects are tackled.</p>
                        <p>The relative efforts in behalf of any of the five priorities will, as in
                            the past, vary with the unfolding of events, the nature of the medium,
                            and the situation in individual countries.</p>
                        <p>The responsibility for co-ordinating Media output on the priority and
                            other subjects will continue to rest with the Assistant Deputy Director

                            <p>The United States has no more urgent task than the pursuit of peace.
                                In the words of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, “We will be unceasing in the search for
                                peace; resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with
                                those with whom we differ.” We believe this search for an attainable
                                and honorable peace should be based on a gradual evolution in human
                                institutions and on a series of concrete actions and effective
                                agreements (such as the limited nuclear test ban) leading to general
                                and complete disarmament. The United States will continue to
                                encourage the settlement of international issues by peaceful means
                                rather than force.</p>
                            <p rend="center">STRENGTH AND RELIABILITY</p>
                            <p>The United States, matured and tested under the responsibilities of
                                free world leadership, will maintain its strength in all fields to
                                protect its own freedom and to aid in the defense of other free
                                nations against threats to their independence and institutions. The
                                United States can and will keep its commitments to its allies and to
                                other countries.</p>

                            <p>The United States believes in a peaceful world community of free and
                                independent states, free to choose their own future, free to build
                                and change their own systems so long as they do not threaten the
                                freedom of others. We believe in the dignity of the individual, and
                                will continue to help other nations in their efforts to modernize
                                their societies, to resist coercion, and to construct and maintain
                                free institutions.</p>

                            <p>The fundamental commitment of the United States is to freedom of the

                                which distinguishes societies of free men from societies where rule
                                is based on privilege and force. Historically, the rule of law was a
                                commitment of the people of the United States to themselves; today
                                it is the cornerstone of both our domestic and international
                                policies. We will continue to work toward perfecting the rule of law
                                at home and encourage its extension to and among all nations.</p>

                        <p>In a January 17, 1964, letter to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>, United States Information Agency
                                (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>) Director <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Edward R. Murrow</persName> discussed responses
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> film, “The March,” which
                            documented the August 28, 1963, March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
                            led by the Reverend <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">Martin Luther King,
                                Jr.</persName> According to <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName>, Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">William
                                Fulbright</persName> (Democrat-Arkansas) and others “questioned the
                            effectiveness abroad” of the film. <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> explained to the President that he had
                            commissioned the film to counter the “distortion” around the world
                            concerning the role violence played in the Civil Rights movement. The
                            film, he stressed, emphasized “that 200,000 Americans, both Negro and
                            white, came to their nation’s capitol and demonstrated peacefully to
                            further the civil rights movement. The quality of that march, which has
                            been described by so many as ‘spiritual’, comes across most forcefully
                            in the film,” and was, in his opinion, “probably the finest argument for
                            peaceful petition for redress of grievance that has ever been put on
                            film.” Noting that the film had been distributed to posts, “under the
                            usual operating procedures,” <persName corresp="#p_MER_1">Murrow</persName> added that if Public Affairs Officers “do not
                            believe it will have a positive effect in their countries, they simply
                            will not show the film.” (Johnson Library, White House Central Files,

                            within the context of an interview with American Broadcasting Company
                                (<gloss target="#t_ABC_1">ABC</gloss>) news correspondent <persName corresp="#p_SHK_1">Howard K. Smith</persName>, scheduled for

                            and Answers,” on February 2. <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>, referencing the film, stated that despite the
                            film’s accuracy, “many Congressmen felt it would give a false impression
                            to primitive peoples in Africa, and they criticized <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> for producing it.” In response to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>’s question as to how
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> would handle the
                            situation, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> responded: “I
                            am not going to adopt any policies, and I don’t believe the United
                            States government can adopt any policies based on the assumption that
                            the people of Africa are so primitive that they can’t understand some
                            fundamentals of life that we in the United States or that the peoples of
                            Europe understand. Now, as I understand this film and as I have looked
                            at it, the purpose of it is to show that this is a country with
                            problems, yes, but a country where the right of peaceful protest, the
                            right of petition, is as much alive as it ever was in the mind of Thomas
                            Jefferson.” <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> continued by
                            stating: “I know Africans who know a lot more about Thomas Jefferson and
                            our Constitution and our Bill of Rights than my children do, or than
                            most American children do. And if they don’t understand it, then that is
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s job to use this film in
                            such a way as to ensure that this point does come across. And I happen
                            to think it is a point worth making.” (Transcript of <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Carl T. Rowan</persName>’s Appearance on “Issues

                        <p>In Joint Circular Message 1431, February 5, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Dean Rusk</persName> and Acting Director of the

                                Wilson</persName> noted the “growing consensus” in Washington that
                            the “film ‘The March’ could be extremely effective for certain audiences
                            in those countries where there is considerable knowledge of the context
                            of the civil rights struggle in the United States and the role played by
                            the Federal Government and bipartisan support for programs on civil
                            rights.” For other countries, the “problem of context might be met by
                            showing the film in conjunction with others illustrating Government’s
                            support for civil rights, including President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s June 11, 1963 speech and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s strong
                            commitment to civil rights, as demonstrated in films ’Let Us Continue’

                                <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> requested that before

                            the film” and determine how the team planned to use the film and send
                            the evaluations to Washington by cable. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 306, DIRCTR Sub Files, 1963–69, Box 6–29

                        <p>Three days later on February 8, <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> sent a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> with copies sent to Attorney General <persName corresp="#p_KRF_1">Robert Kennedy</persName> and the President’s

                            explained the film’s background and noted that Joint Circular 1431 had
                            placed a “‘hold’ on public showings and requires a Country Team
                            evaluation.” <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> wrote that
                            Senator Bourke Hickenlooper (Republican-Iowa) had asserted that the U.S.
                            Advisory Commission on Information (<gloss target="#t_USACI_1">USACI</gloss>) had “unanimously recommended” that the film not be
                            shown and the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> had “elected to
                            override that advice.” Addressing Hickenlooper’s concern, he commented
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USACI_1">USACI</gloss> recommended that care
                            be used in the selection of countries for showing “The March,” adding
                            that “I said that our approach in the cable of February 5 met that
                            Advisory Commission concern directly.”</p>
                        <p>Continuing, <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> wrote that
                            Hickenlooper, Senator Frank J. Lausche (Democrat-Ohio), and “to a lesser
                            extent” Senator George Aiken (Republican-Vermont) “commented adversely”
                            on the film before the showing and that Hickenlooper, referred to “our
                            country’s propensity for ‘self-flagellation’ before the world.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>’s views were
                            “favorable toward usage of the film before audiences able to comprehend
                            the background and context of the civil rights movement in this
                            country.” <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> was
                            concerned whether <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> could properly explain that “when
                            the Negro in this country says ‘I want freedom’ he means something much
                            different than when an African from a former Colonial area says it.”

                            others preferred to withhold screening until passage of the Civil Rights

                            Fiscal Year 1965 appropriations. In reference to questions concerning
                            “The March,” he first explained the global reaction to the film and the
                            history behind sending Joint Circular 1431 in order to elicit responses
                            from the country teams. <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>
                            stated: “I have here, for example, a newspaper from India about <pb n="17" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_17"/>the showing of this film in
                            Calcutta. Calcutta just happens to be our most troublesome major city in
                            India. It has the greatest percentage of Communists. The university
                            students or student groups are generally controlled by Communists. The
                            Embassy in Delhi has made it clear that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>’s biggest job in India is in the Calcutta area. This
                            article says that: ‘This film has made a big impact on the young
                            intelligentsia of this city. A most moving human document, the film has
                            been shown to college students all over Calcutta and in June and July
                            will be shown in educational institutions in the district. It was a very
                            pleasant revelation to college authorities that for once the thunder had
                            been stolen from the Communist sympathizers in the colleges.’ So these
                            are our friends in India who are crediting this film with making it
                            possible for them to steal the thunder from the Communist sympathizers
                            and get the youth to talk about something much more constructive in the
                            United States.” <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> further
                            stressed that “whereas a lot of [Communist sympathizers] wanted to make
                            all Indians believe that every white American was at every Negro
                            American’s throat, this film showed in a very dramatic fashion, but not
                            a hammer-on-the-head way, the fact that there was considerable
                            cooperation between American Negroes and whites in this country; that
                            whereas the Communists were trying to spread the propaganda that every
                            Negro in the United States was wallowing in misery and poverty, these
                            students could see that here were Negro Americans who were well dressed,
                            well educated, articulate, and, what was extremely important, that they
                            had a freedom which does not exist in the majority of the countries of
                            the world, and that is the freedom under the first amendment of our
                            Constitution, the right to peacefully assemble and seek redress of
                            grievances, which is what this film illustrated very dramatically.” (<hi rend="italic">Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the Committee on

                        <p>Gene Kelly<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Popular American film actor, dancer,
                                and entertainer.</note> will be in Washington on Monday, January 27
                            for a debriefing at the State Department following a month-long tour of
                            French West Africa and Ghana under the cultural exchange program.
                            According to reports received here Mr. Kelly’s tour has been a
                            tremendous success and he was extremely well received by press, youth
                            groups, officials, etc.</p>
                        <p>Kelly ran fifty minutes of film which he put together on many of his
                            famous dance numbers and followed this show with a lecture on the
                            history of American dance, motion pictures in the U.S. and a lot of
                            other things plus answered questions directed to him by the various
                            groups to whom he spoke.</p>
                        <p>He went to Senegal, Upper Volta,<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">Reference is
                                to the previous name for the West African country of Burkina

                            Ghana because of its current significance.</p>

                            all possible for him to have a brief meeting with Mr. Kelly sometime
                            prior to his departure?</p>
                        <p>I think it is of particular importance because Kelly did take a month out
                            of his busy schedule to make this tour because we felt he could make an
                            important contribution to U.S.-Afro relations. The results prove us to
                            be right. He will be in Washington all day the 27th so anytime
                            convenient to the President would naturally be fine.</p>
                        <p>In as much as we are trying to encourage our articulate artists to go
                            abroad, particularly to the underdeveloped countries to talk to <pb n="19" facs="0060" xml:id="pg_19"/>students, drama groups, etc. I

                            was included in a single newscast in English and Arabic which went on

                        <p>The leadership and foreign policies of the late President had wide appeal
                            abroad. Along with expressions of sympathy and loss, foreign comment

                        <p>Foreign opinion was impressed by the orderliness of the transition, and
                            saw in it a demonstration of essential U.S. stability. Your demon<pb n="22" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_22"/>stration of determination to
                            pursue the broad lines of existing U.S. policy gave further reassurance
                            that U.S. leadership would be neither interrupted nor weakened.</p>
                        <p>Although no definitive assessment of your Administration has gained
                            general currency, foreign reactions are clearly favorable on two major

                        <p>Despite initial concern that you might pursue a more cautious course,
                            foreign opinion has viewed your position on civil rights as a <pb n="23" facs="0064" xml:id="pg_23"/>forthright determination to carry
                            forward the late President’s program. Your call for a war on poverty,
                            your role in support of increased educational programs, have been
                            praised, with some comment seeing in these programs a degree of personal
                            involvement greater than your predecessor’s.</p>
                        <p>Opinion of you as a political personality appears as yet to be neither
                            very clearly nor very firmly held. You were seen, on entering office, as
                            an experienced political leader with a high degree of political acumen,
                            decisive and pragmatic. Comment was cautious in assessing your probable
                            course, but a more realistic, less imaginative, more compromising, less
                            audacious leadership was often predicted. This feeling appears to
                            continue, though somewhat diminished. Foreign observers are still taking
                            your measure as a new leader whom they see as largely untested in the
                            field of foreign affairs. No single stereotype of you has clearly
                            emerged except possibly the tendency in foreign comment and cartoons,
                            both hostile and favorable, to depict you as a Texan in cowboy hat.</p>
                        <p>Two aspects of some foreign comment tend to have adverse or qualifying

                        <quote><p>—Informed opinion is highly aware that this is an election year in
                                which U.S. leadership traditionally is strongly responsive to
                                domestic political currents. There is some concern that domestic
                                political pressures may unduly affect the conduct of foreign
                                affairs, and that domestic programs and actions may be shaped by
                                political expediency.</p>
                            <p>—Some comment is skeptical about whether your goal of frugality is
                                consistent with the effective carrying out of your programs. Foreign
                                comment sometimes seems uncertain as to whether the U.S. is entering
                                a period of retrenchment or plans to expand Government efforts in
                                the fields of human and social welfare.</p></quote>
                        <p>Some specific actions or policies draw regional criticism. The Arab world
                            currently views you as pro-Israeli and thus anti-Arab. Inevitably,
                            reaction to other aspects of your Administration and your actions tend
                            to be colored by this adverse view.</p>
                        <p>On the issue of trade with Cuba, most European opinion is unfavorable to
                            the U.S. position, but objections are not currently in terms hostile to
                            you, personally. In France, Gaullist<note n="8" xml:id="d10fn8">Reference is to supporters of French President de Gaulle.</note>
                            opinion, strongly partisan, sometimes seeks to defend their leader’s
                            role by attacking your leadership.</p>
                        <p>The widely-held belief that violence and lawlessness are prominent
                            features of American life has been deepened by the events of November,
                            despite praise for your condemnation of violence and your appeals for
                            unity and tolerance.</p>

                            worldwide surveys have been made since the start of your Administration,
                            the evidence available indicates that there has been no substantial
                            change in general esteem for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Since November there have been several private surveys<note n="9" xml:id="d10fn9">Not further identified.</note> in Western Europe
                            regarding opinion of the U.S. in general and opinion of you in

                        <p>Mr. Chairman, I love introductions—of me—but unfortunately they all
                            remind me of the time that Orson Welles<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">Famous American stage, radio, and film director and actor.</note>
                            spoke before a disappointingly small audience. In characteristic
                            modesty, he began by detailing his qualifications as orator and bearer
                            of wisdom.</p>
                        <p>“I am a playwright as well as a producer of plays,” he said, “and
                            Broadway has thrilled to my acting. I am a screen star <hi rend="italic">and</hi> a noted producer of movies. I am an author, a painter, and
                            a renowned magician. I am a virtuoso of the violin and a wizard of the
                            piano. . .”</p>
                        <p>At this point Welles paused, took another look at his audience, and
                            exclaimed: “Isn’t it a shame that there are so many of me and so few of
                            you.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chairman, your introduction made it sound as though there are several
                            of me here today, but fortunately the audience is such that I remain
                            considerably outnumbered.</p>
                        <p>And happily, I note that my audience is composed of international
                            broadcasters. This is my first full-fledged speech as Director of the
                            United States Information Agency, and it is fitting that it should be
                            before men and women whose major focus is on the outside world. Our
                            objectives may not be synonymous, but our areas of mutual interest are
                            many—not the least being our desire to learn better ways to transport
                            our messages to distant peoples and places.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps there is irony in the fact that I, the smudge of inked newsprint
                            barely off my hands, should suddenly be in the broadcasting business.
                            But in it I am, and in a big way. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Voice of America is broadcasting 112 hours daily in 36
                            languages—or almost 800 hours a week to almost every point on the globe.
                            In addition, each week some 14,000 hours of our taped radio programs are
                            broadcasted on other stations of the world.</p>
                        <p><pb n="26" facs="0067" xml:id="pg_26"/>And in the fast growing field of
                            television, we are producing 200 hours of programming annually for
                            telecasting on stations in 80 countries.</p>
                        <p>In true Orson Wellesian style, I could go on to tell you how, with movies
                            in 52 languages, we reach some 750 million people a year. Or how we
                            influence vast millions through our 85 magazines, 20 newspapers and the
                            10,000 words that go out daily on our wireless file to 111 posts
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>Or, for those of you who believe that a picture is worth 1,000 words, I
                            could mention the 735,000 prints and 220,000 copy negatives that we sent
                            out last year.</p>
                        <p>But I know, and I am sure you know, that it means little to say that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> distributes 20 million
                            pamphlets or 10 million books a year, or that it has a comic strip that
                            is the most widely read feature in the world. Each of us knows that none
                            of these statistics means anything until we know also what it is that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is saying through these
                            media.</p>
                        <p>That is what I want to talk about today. I have received many letters of
                            sympathy from people who think that I have moved into an especially
                            difficult job. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a challenging job, but it is
                            far from impossible; indeed it is difficult only to the extent that we
                            Americans are unsure of what we wish to say to the world. My
                            conversations with my colleagues, with members of the press and of the
                            Congress, with friends from many fields, indicate that there is a
                            glaring lack of consensus as to what <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is to do—and how.</p>
                        <p>Part of the confusion arises from the fact that our own society is
                            complex. This great diversity of viewpoint that we not only tolerate but
                            encourage is strongly reflected when someone mentions our informational
                            program. No small number of people have said to me recently that we can
                            win the world quickly if only we expose it to their ideas.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we find that we lack consensus also because of the
                            complex nature of this world to which we speak. We find ourselves
                            attempting to convince, to win the support of, not just young nations
                            inhabited by peoples of different racial or historical background, not
                            just our adversaries whose differences of political outlook pose a
                            threat to our security, but also those long-time friends whose history
                            and culture are part of our very being.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it is only natural that where complexity is piled on complexity,
                            men become impatient to simplify everything. So it is that we find so
                            many Americans today who seek to reduce every conflict to the simple
                            cops-and-robbers theme of every week’s television drama.</p>
                        <p>Whether the scenario be Cambodia, or Cyprus, Zanzibar<note n="3" xml:id="d11fn3">The semi-autonomous islands off the coast of
                                Tanzania in East Africa.</note> or Brazil, this simplified theory of
                            foreign policy is that there is always an easily <pb n="27" facs="0068" xml:id="pg_27"/>distinguishable good guy and an equally obvious
                            villain, each of whom is to be respectively embraced or disowned by all
                            but the obviously disloyal. Unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately—our
                            world is not as simple as that. We in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> see day after day that ours is a world of subtle and
                            tricky nuances. And I fear that our Number One problem may not be that
                            we face adversaries skilled in their trade and unscrupulous in their
                            tactics, but rather the fact that so many of our countrymen, following
                            the “simplified approach to foreign policy,” prefer to ignore the
                            subtleties and the delicate shadings that are a part of this business of
                            winning friends and influencing people. They would urge upon us a
                            conglomeration of “hard sell” nostrums that have little real
                            relationship to the problems we face.</p>
                        <p>This burden is exemplified in its most exasperating form in the comments
                            of those who think that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has the
                            sole and simple mission of saying to the world again and again what is
                            good and right and great about this country.</p>
                        <p>There are people who believe, rightly, that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should not dwell solely on our unemployment problems,
                            or instances of corruption or incidents of racial conflict, or the
                            carryings-on of our gangster element. They know, as do you and I, that
                            it is so obvious as to preclude discussion that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s function is to give foreigners a
                            closer understanding and a greater appreciation of these United States.
                            This means that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is obligated to
                            emphasize some of the positive things that rarely make the commercial
                            media that operate on the old journalistic credo that “good news is no
                            news.”</p>
                        <p>The trouble is that, cloaked in this basic and honorable purpose, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> quickly falls victim to the
                            simplifiers who think <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should go
                            all the way and force the world to look at America through rose-colored
                            glasses.</p>
                        <p>In recent days I have been badgered by people who ask why our libraries
                            abroad contain magazines like Time, Newsweek, the Saturday Evening Post.
                            One particularly vocal critic pointed out that almost every issue of
                            these magazines contains one or more articles that are critical of the
                            U.S. Government, or are full of information about this country “that
                            can’t do us any good abroad.”</p>
                        <p>“Our enemies are saying enough critical things about us,” said one
                            individual. “Why does <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> have to say
                                <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> about our faults?”</p>
                        <p>I have pressed hard to explain that the easiest way to destroy <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, to render it totally ineffective,
                            would be to have it feed the world nothing but superlatives about
                            America and the American way of life. And I have been hard pressed to
                            make the “simplifiers” understand that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can and has worked some minor miracles in the
                            propaganda field, but it can never do the undoable or hide the
                            unhideable.</p>
                        <p><pb n="28" facs="0069" xml:id="pg_28"/>What the advocates of the
                            rose-colored-glasses approach seem not to understand is the fact that
                            while <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a Voice of America, it
                            is only a part, indeed a small part, of the real “voice of America.” In
                            our era of miraculously rapid communications, the words of a Congressman
                            engaged in bitter floor debate, a speech by an official of the Chamber

                            our military leaders moves to the farthest corners of the globe as
                            quickly as do the best-planned words of any Voice of America
                            announcer.</p>
                        <p>The million <gloss target="#t_GI_1">GI</gloss>’s and dependents who are
                            overseas, the 30,000 American missionaries abroad, the four million
                            American tourists who scatter about the globe each year, the half
                            million Americans who go abroad for business reasons, or to represent
                            foundations and participate in educational and cultural exchanges, all
                            are our “voices of America.” And not to be ignored are the 50,000
                            foreign students who come to this country each year to study, and the
                            thousands of foreign tourists and the scores of foreign journalists who
                            develop their own version of the image of America. They, too, speak to
                            that outside world, and generally with the natural credibility for which
                            our official organs can only strive. So you see that in this context,
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> becomes but a small part of
                            the cacophony that is the real voice of America abroad.</p>
                        <p>But it is for just this reason that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s role is vital. We cannot afford to have the voices
                            of freedom add up to a babble of confusion for foreigners. It is <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s role, then, to ensure that out of
                            this dialogue of freedom is extracted a message that is intelligible and
                            credible.</p>
                        <p>For as long as I can foresee, our country will be involved in an all-out
                            ideological struggle. In this contest of impressions and
                            mis-impressions, of distortions both deliberate and accidental, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must be the restorer of focus, the
                            provider of the perspective without which our policies and our purpose
                            can never be understood.</p>
                        <p>You international broadcasters constitute an invaluable ally to the
                            extent that you help to maintain the perspective, to keep the dialogue
                            of freedom restrained to a point where it does not mislead a suspicious,
                            often ill-informed world.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I took a close look at one day’s output of the New China News
                                Agency,<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn5">Reference is to the Government of
                                People’s Republic of China state-controlled news agency.</note> the
                            propaganda voice of the Chinese Communists. It was a constant harangue
                            about alleged United States colonialism in Panama; about so-called
                            confusion in Washington as our “politicians both in and out of power are
                            bickering” about the situation in South <pb n="29" facs="0070" xml:id="pg_29"/>Viet-Nam; about poverty in the United States being
                            so horrible that “President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> had to declare official war on it”; about
                            rampant “racial injustice” in America, and on and on.</p>
                        <p>The significant thing was that almost every item carried by the New China
                            News Agency was based on a statement by some American official or an
                            editorial in some American newspaper. In other words, the merchants of
                            tyranny are trying to turn our freedom of expression into a mighty
                            weapon against us. Their obvious goal is to hang us with our own
                            words.</p>
                        <p>We cannot silence American politicians or the American press, nor have we
                            any desire to do so. But it must be obvious that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cannot fulfill its mission unless it
                            talks about the things that free Americans and the free American press
                            are discussing. We know that our adversaries are talking about these
                            things, and one of our most urgent tasks is to ensure that their
                            distortions are not accepted because we are in timid default.</p>
                        <p>We must and we shall pursue our mission with vigor. Perhaps we shall make
                            mistakes, but I want all my colleagues to know that if we err, let it be
                            on the side of boldness. Let it be because we are moving with confidence
                            to tell the world what our country is and what it strives to be.</p>
                        <p>Yes, you too are asking what, in my view, this country is and what it
                            strives to be. I gave my view recently before the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee, and I dare to repeat it today.<note n="6" xml:id="d11fn6"><persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> gave

                        <p>“America is capitalism with a conscience—a country in which laborers own
                            homes, automobiles, new refrigerators, but, more important, where

                            government.</p>
                        <p>“America is a rocket pin-pointed on the moon and Polaris submarines
                            cruising as sentinels of the deep—military might never surpassed in
                            history, but might harnessed by a sense of responsibility for man’s
                            destiny and by a national desire for peace within freedom.</p>

                            ferment—a society caught up in concern for its aged and its ill, full of
                            compassion for its improverished. . . a people struggling as no society
                                <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> struggled to achieve a unity that
                            transcends the incidental boundaries of religion, race, national

                            the hungry and the harassed, toward the goal of a peaceful world
                            community of free and independent states.”</p>
                        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, brevity forbids my saying all that this nation is.
                            But I think that I have said enough to justify my fundamental belief
                            that all we need wish the world to know about us is the truth. Through
                            face-to-face contacts, through television, films and radio, and through
                            the printed word, we shall spread the truth, and I am confident that the
                            truth will keep us free.</p>
                        <p>As though it were necessary, I call your attention to the fact that this
                            is an election year—meaning that the danger is all the greater that our
                            dialogue of free speech will appear to strangers to be a babble of
                            confusion and conflict. We are going to do our best to keep the record
                            straight, to keep the world remembering that this periodic political
                            ritual, while vastly important to us, generates a lot of heat and a lot
                            of oratory that have nothing to do with the fundamental strength, unity
                            and commitment of this nation.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, one of the things I should like most to have the world understand
                            is that it is out of the free airing of complaints, the free expression
                            of conflicting viewpoints that a free society makes progress, or goes
                            about erasing social ills.</p>
                        <p>We shall try to get this message across, even as we flinch from time to
                            time at the evidence that no people ever indulged more in self-criticism
                            than do we Americans.</p>
                        <p>I am not so sure that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> can convince
                            the world that we are a lot better than we Americans tell each other we
                            are—although that surely is the truth. This may be a forlorn hope, but I
                            can hope that Americans might remember that there is a world of
                            difference between the constructive self-criticism that produces
                            progress and the irresponsible self-flagellation that confuses others as
                            to both our intentions and our ability to see them through. I solicit
                            your help in helping Americans to remember this distinction.</p>
                        <p>In any event, ladies and gentlemen, it is going to be an interesting and
                            a trying year for “us broadcasters.” May we be lucky enough always to
                            know the truth and wise enough to deliver it where it most needs to be
                            heard.</p>

                        <p>The Mission of the U.S. Information Agency, as defined by the President,
                            “is to help achieve United States foreign policy objectives.”<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">See <ref target="#d5fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    5</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>In carrying out this Mission, the President instructed the Agency, among
                            other things, to “emphasize . . . those aspects of American life and
                            culture which facilitate sympathetic understanding of United States
                            policies.”</p>
                        <p>In order to utilize our limited resources for our most urgent needs, and
                            to harmonize media output in meeting these needs, priorities for media
                            output were established by the Agency in July, 1961,<note n="3" xml:id="d12fn3">See <ref target="#d5fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    5</ref>.</note> and revised in December, 1963.<note n="4" xml:id="d12fn4">See <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note>
                            Priorities are also required for that portion of our output on American
                            life and culture to assure that we “emphasize . . . those aspects . . .
                            which facilitate sympathetic understanding of United States policies.”
                            The American scene is so varied that only conscious and careful
                            selection for coverage within a framework of priorities can prevent us
                            from diffusing and dissipating our means.</p>
                        <p>In many countries there are both damaging gaps in knowledge about the
                            United States and widely held shibboleths which adversely affect the
                            achievement of our objectives. Among these stubborn canards are that we
                            are capitalists in the evil 19th century Marxist sense, that we are
                            materialistic and without culture, that we are racist, and that we are
                            in a stage of economic stagnation. The latter supports the corollary
                            effort of the Communists to represent themselves as the “wave of the
                            future.”</p>
                        <p>This memorandum establishes priorities for output on the aspects of
                            American life and culture which will facilitate achievement of U.S.
                            foreign policies. These priorities have been approved by the Director
                            and the Deputy Director.</p>
                        <p>The attached priority subjects are, of course, not exclusive, but must be
                            given as full and persuasive treatment in all Media as resources <pb n="32" facs="0073" xml:id="pg_32"/>permit before other subjects are
                            tackled. Submissions to the Quarterly Media—Area Meetings should reflect
                            these priorities.</p>
                        <p>The relative efforts in behalf of any of the priorities will, as in the
                            past, vary with the unfolding of events, the nature of the medium, and
                            the situation in individual countries.</p>
                        <p>The responsibility for coordinating Media output on these priority and
                            other subjects will continue to rest with the Assistant Deputy Director
                            (Media Content).</p>

                            <p>The United States has the most diverse population in the world. In
                                the melting pot process, minorities have often suffered in the U.S.,
                                as they have historically and still do in many countries. But the
                                U.S. democratic social, political, and economic system has provided
                                a means for them to join and be absorbed into the main stream of
                                American life, in all its richness and variety. The last large such
                                minority—Negro Americans—are now actively in this process of full
                                integration. Progress will not always be easy, but, with the support
                                of the Federal Government and a majority of the citizenry, will
                                continue until the process is complete.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. ECONOMIC STRENGTH</p>
                            <p>The U.S. has developed the most powerful and productive economy the
                                world has ever seen, based on a dynamic balance among business,
                                labor, and government. Incentives provide opportunity; government
                                protects against abuses and excess fluctuation of the business
                                cycle. The U.S. economy continues to grow rapidly, and there is no
                                evidence that the Soviets will overtake it soon or in the
                                foreseeable future. The strength and productivity of the U.S.
                                economy permits the U.S. to provide its people with material
                                standards and welfare measures which the communists have only
                                promised; to keep itself and the free <pb n="33" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_33"/>world armed at a level adequate to protect
                                against all forms of attack, and to provide substantial aid to less
                                developed countries.</p>

                            <p>Social benefits, strong labor unions, a progressive tax system, broad
                                capital ownership by the populace, and Government regulatory
                                agencies contribute to widespread ownership and enjoyment of U.S.
                                productive wealth. The American system of “capitalism with a
                                    conscience”<note n="6" xml:id="d12fn6"><persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> also used this term

                                far closer in philosophy and practice to the non-coercive Social
                                Democracy of Western Europe than it is to the earlier capitalistic
                                concept. Despite this progress, the U.S. seeks still greater
                                economic opportunity and equality for all its citizens.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL STRENGTH</p>
                            <p>The United States is one of the leaders of the international
                                scientific community, with a depth and breadth of pure and applied
                                scientific research unmatched in any other country. After a late
                                start, the U.S. has taken the lead in space technology and
                                exploration. The quality of the U.S. educational system also ranks
                                with that of the most advanced nations. The American system is
                                unique in the large percentage of its citizens who receive a higher
                                education. Higher learning is available without regard to economic
                                or social classes. Claims that the rigid Soviet educational system
                                is likely soon to overtake the American system in either quality or
                                quantity are not borne out by the facts or by authoritative
                                projections for the next decades.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, DIVERSITY,
                                DISTRIBUTION</p>
                            <p>Drawing upon its native inheritance and the wealth of intellectual,
                                artistic, philosophic, and religious traditions brought by
                                immigrants, the U.S. has created its own variegated, dynamic,
                                serious culture. Its hallmark is freedom: there are no more barriers
                                to expression in art than there are in speech; there is no cultural
                                party line imposed from the top. While respecting tradition and
                                continuing to study and appreciate the classical inheritance,
                                current American intellectual life, art, music, literature and other
                                cultural manifestations are characterized by vitality and a will to
                                experiment. Culture in the United States is not reserved for a
                                privileged few nor confined to the capital cities; it spans the
                                breadth of the people and the land. The United States believes in
                                the freedom to create, not only in the United States but for the
                                people everywhere, and the free flow of culture among nations.</p>

                            came to the conclusion that <hi rend="italic">the weakest part of the
                                war operation, both on our part and that of the Government of South
                                Viet-Nam, is in the field of information and psychological
                                warfare</hi>. According to a report by the Military Advisory
                                Commission<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                            as well as information gathered by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>, this is true on both a nationwide basis and a
                            province-by-province basis.</p>
                        <p>It is my judgment that <hi rend="italic">the Viet-Namese people will
                                never give sufficient support to the war effort until certain
                                glaring gaps are closed</hi> in the information-psychological
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>In view of the importance of public opinion in Viet-Nam, in this country
                            and in the world at large, I believe that <hi rend="italic">top priority
                                should be given to a large scale United States program to improve
                                the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> ability to win the support
                                of the people and to tell its story abroad</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Two steps are urgently required:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. We must place informational-psychological advisors into every
                                major area, just as we have placed military and economic development
                                advisors throughout the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                                organization.</p>
                            <p>2. We must begin a crash program to train promising South Viet-Namese
                                personnel in radio, motion picture, publishing and other techniques
                                crucial to any programs of psychological warfare. This is essential
                                because it is unanimously agreed that the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> is sorely lacking in personnel with the motivation
                                and training to do the job required.</p></quote>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">I found Prime Minister Khanh and Minister of
                                Information Pham Thai extremely forthcoming</hi> in talks about a
                            new information program, and both expressed eagerness to have United
                            States assistance—a sharp improvement over the attitude of the Diem
                            government. This Agency already has submitted to the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> a detailed proposal of steps needed
                                <pb n="35" facs="0076" xml:id="pg_35"/>to improve its psychological
                            warfare performance. The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has
                            promised to respond with a detailed proposal of areas in which it wishes
                            our immediate assistance.</p>
                        <p>While in Saigon, I also held sessions with the representatives of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss>, the Embassy
                            political section and my <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> staff.
                            We agreed on steps now underway, or soon to be gotten underway, which
                            require no action from Washington. (For example, a small group of key
                            Americans and a few top Viet-Namese officials Monday held the first
                            meeting of a joint psychological operations committee which had been set
                            up some time earlier but had never gotten together.)<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">No record of the Monday, April 20, meeting has been
                                found.</note></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">If the proposed program is to succeed</hi>, it will
                            require a modest outlay of U.S. funds and some increase in personnel
                            from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and perhaps other U.S.
                            agencies. I recommend also that we explore the possibility of third
                            country contributions to the information program. U.S. expenditures in
                            the information-psychological field are now quite small, relatively
                            speaking. In fact, I was informed that the program is a failure in
                            several provinces because of the lack of small bits of money to pay for
                            such things as the running of a projector, or paper on which to print
                            leaflets.</p>
                        <p>I emphasize strongly my belief that <hi rend="italic">the information
                                effort will fail, no matter what resources we pour into it, unless
                                it has the clear direction of a single individual</hi> capable of
                            formulating the program required and of guiding it to success. For many
                            reasons, I believe that the control should be civilian and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry Zorthian</persName>, the Country
                            Public Affairs Officer and one of the most capable men in this entire
                            agency, should be given this responsibility.</p>
                        <p>I further recommend that a top <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            officer be included as an official part of any subsequent missions from
                            Washington to study the development of the Viet-Namese operation.
                            Likewise, if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> is to
                            have a chance at success, <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must be represented on all committees in
                                Washington which are mapping plans to carry us to victory in
                                Viet-Nam</hi>.</p>

                        <p>In your memorandum of April 6,<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">Not
                                found.</note> you asked for some rough measures of the size of
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs in Europe compared with
                            other regions of the world.</p>
                        <p>I share your concern for the need to give emphasis to the underdeveloped
                            and emerging areas. Ever since I came into this job I have periodically
                            exhorted my people to plan with a critical eye toward regional
                            priorities. Looking back at the program over the past several years I
                            think one would have to conclude that it has in fact been responsive to
                            shifts in regional importance. There is a very clear trend of
                            diminishing emphasis on Western Europe and of increasing size of
                            programs for Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America, as you will see
                            from the attached data. For example, <hi rend="italic">ten years ago
                                some 62 percent of our total exchange of persons funds were devoted
                                to Europe—today only 21 percent</hi>.</p>
                        <p>What one <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have differing opinions about, of
                            course, is whether this trend is progressing fast enough, and I look
                            forward to discussing this with you and <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Don
                                Wilson</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3"><persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> underlined “you and

                            must caution you, however, that the full story is not in the figures
                            alone. If it were just a question of juggling the budget around to a
                            better “profile”, the answer would be relatively simple. But in truth,
                            there are several other factors involved in the case for maintaining
                            Western Europe at about the present level. Among these—and not
                            necessarily in the order of their importance—are:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. The presence of very large numbers of foreign students in
                                Western Europe, many of them from key African and other
                                underdeveloped countries;</p>
                            <p>2. The fact that we have a foreign currency requirement to meet in
                                the program and these currencies are largely available in
                                Europe—practically none are available in Africa and few in Latin
                                America;</p>
                            <p>3. Domestic political considerations which cannot be ignored—Senator
                                    <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> and other key
                                Congressional figures are reluctant to see Western Europe cut,
                                though they want larger programs for the other areas;</p>
                            <p><pb n="37" facs="0078" xml:id="pg_37"/>4. The existence of <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> agreements with most
                                Western European countries which embody commitments to certain

                            requires a continuing search for effective means to meet this challenge.
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong’s <hi rend="italic">China Reporting Program</hi>, which produces information materials

                            important role in assisting <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> posts
                            and other mission elements meet this problem. The Director requests that

                        <p>The Sino-Soviet dispute has resulted in Communist China’s assuming an
                            increasingly independent foreign policy line from the Soviet Union. This
                            development requires our treating Communist China as a subject of
                            special concern separate from the Soviet Union. As Peiping<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">Beijing.</note> attempts to pass itself off as a
                            model of economic development and the political “wave of the future” in
                            underdeveloped areas and steps up its diplomatic and commercial
                            offensive in Europe and elsewhere, there is an increasing need for
                            material to expose Communist China as a threat to the peace, progress,
                            and freedom of the non-communist world. The <hi rend="italic">China

                            are sent regularly to each <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p>1. All posts should be familiar with the operation of the <hi rend="italic">China Reporting Program</hi> and its products. The
                            Agency is fully aware that special circumstances in certain countries
                            may limit the degree to which <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss>
                            materials can be effectively distributed. However, the materials can
                            furnish useful background and talking points for officers where
                            placement in local media is not possible. Further, the Agency recommends
                            that where applicable, posts should bring <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> materials to the attention of other elements of
                            missions such as labor, commercial, and agricultural attaches, who may
                            wish to receive some of the items and who may have additional
                            suggestions for their use.</p>
                        <p>2. Careful study should be made of the possibilities for unattributed
                            direct mailing of <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> materials from
                            Hong Kong to individuals or institutions likely to have an interest in
                            Communist Chinese affairs, in instances where <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> distribution is not practical or desirable. Posts may
                            furnish <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong with the names
                            and addresses of recipients, for materials selected by the post, and
                            these will be mailed directly from Hong Kong without attribution to
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.<note n="12" xml:id="d15fn12">An
                                unknown hand underlined the phrases “Posts may furnish <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong with the names and
                                addresses of recipients,” “selected by the post,” and “without

                        <p>3. The Agency recommends that posts assign one individual responsibility
                            for liaison with <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong on <hi rend="italic">China Reporting Program</hi> matters.</p>
                        <p>4. Since <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> materials are produced for
                            general world-wide use<note n="13" xml:id="d15fn13">An unknown hand

                            than for a specific area of country, this poses problems in terms of
                            tailoring products for special needs of individual posts. However, to
                            the extent of its resources, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong
                            Kong will make every attempt to provide special materials when
                            requested.</p>
                        <p><pb n="42" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_42"/>In this connection, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong actively seeks and would
                            welcome suggestions from all posts on ways to improve existing <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> materials; ideas for books, articles,
                            pamphlets; other suggestions for making the program more effective. Such
                            suggestions should be sent jointly to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IAF_1">IAF</gloss> Washington.</p>
                        <p>5. The Agency recommends that all posts consider potential contributors
                            to the <hi rend="italic">China Reporting Program.</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong would appreciate
                            hearing about recognized writers, journalists, scholars dealing with
                            contemporary Chinese Communist affairs who might be interested in
                            writing a <gloss target="#t_CRP_1">CRP</gloss> book or articles for <hi rend="italic">Current Scene.</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Hong Kong is prepared to pay

                        <p>During and since my visit to South Viet-Nam, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has given the highest priority to altering its program
                            so as to meet the urgent needs of Southeast Asia.<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">See <ref target="#d13">Document 13</ref> and <ref target="#d13fn2">footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> In this
                            connection, I have:</p>
                        <p>1. Increased the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> staff in Viet-Nam
                            by adding ten new positions.</p>
                        <p>2. Assigned three officers to Viet-Nam on temporary duty to assist in
                            radio program production and other information activities.</p>
                        <p>3. Authorized the direct transfer of personnel from any post in the world
                            to fill needs in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. Facilitated an agreement with the Defense Department to train an
                            additional 42 Army officers who will serve as psychological warfare <pb n="43" facs="0084" xml:id="pg_43"/>and civil affairs advisors at the
                            province level. This will permit a vitally-needed expansion of the
                            psychological warfare program in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>5. Recommended to <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> (and secured its
                            agreement) that a $278,000 “petty cash” fund be set up to insure that
                            the information program in the provinces is not hampered because of lack
                            of funds to cover such items as paper, ink or spare parts.</p>
                        <p>6. Increased Voice of America broadcasting into North Viet-Nam and made
                            arrangements for a broad expansion of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts in Vietnamese in early July.</p>
                        <p>7. Secured the agreement of the Government of Viet-Nam to the
                            installation of a portable 50 kilowatt transmitter to be located near
                            Hue for broadcasting into North Viet-Nam (this is a joint <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-Defense project, with Defense
                            providing most of the money).</p>
                        <p>8. Arranged to fly, with the help of the Defense Department, three 50
                            kilowatt short-wave transmitters from Liberia to the Philippines so as
                            to increase our Southeast Asia coverage by fifty per cent.</p>
                        <p>9. Agreed to provide a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer as
                            an engineering advisor to Radio Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>10. Asked the Australian Government to provide a program advisor for
                            Radio Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>11. Placed on duty a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer to
                            advise the Government of Viet-Nam on motion picture production and have
                            agreed to provide a production specialist for the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> printing plant.</p>
                        <p>12. Agreed to provide a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer
                            who will serve as personal press relations advisor to Premier Khanh
                            (this officer, who previously gave award-winning service in Viet-Nam,
                            has been pulled out of France and is now enroute to Saigon.)</p>
                        <p>13. Submitted a comprehensive country-wide information program for
                            approval of the Government of Viet-Nam (this has been approved in
                            principle and the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> is now being
                            pressed to implement the program with speed.)</p>
                        <p>14. Set up in Washington a special research unit to produce materials on
                            Viet-Nam for use by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and other

                        <p>On May 3 we introduced a new half-hour of prime evening time broadcasting
                            to Viet-Nam. This raised to three hours per day our program designed to
                            influence listeners in the North. By mid-July, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will broadcast a solid evening block of five and

                            the Communists resort to jamming.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the three 50 kilowatt short-wave transmitters to be flown
                            from Liberia to the Philippines next month are expected to be
                            operational by July 18. The Philippines is an ideal distance from
                            Viet-Nam for short-wave coverage. These three transmitters will provide
                            a good signal for a full program day.</p>
                        <p>I discussed with you our need for a megawatt medium-wave transmitter in
                            the area in order for us to compete with Peking and Hanoi. I want to
                            emphasize, however, that this facility is not of immediate importance
                            because 18 to 24 months would be required for its construction. We have
                            rushed, therefore, to install the kind of facilities that can have some
                            immediate influence on the situation.</p>

                        <p>General lack of coordination has been, in my view, our gravest problem in

                        <p>There has been considerable progress in recent weeks. <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> has been made Chairman of a

                            created to merge the resources of all U.S. agencies for the
                            psychological effort.</p>
                        <p>I emphasize, however, that <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            staff are still not in a position where they have any clear
                            responsibility for dealing with the American press. I do not say this to
                            suggest that giving them such responsibility would end the spate of
                            critical articles written by American newsmen. Many, such as those by
                            Jim Lucas in the Washington DAILY NEWS, are the products of reporters
                            who go out into the field, gain the confidence of our soldiers and then
                            pick up bits of information which they turn into stories that are not at
                            all helpful to our over-all mission. These are reporters who will be
                            influenced little, if at all, by government press officers. I do
                            believe, however, that <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName>
                            and other <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers ought to be
                            free to make whatever effort they can to inform and give guidance to
                            American newsmen.</p>
                        <p>One aspect of the reports by American newsmen that has bothered me was
                            their tendency to emphasize American mistakes and acts that could be
                            called “brutal” and to give little coverage to Viet Cong atrocities.
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has recommended that a
                            special Army photographic team be sent to South Viet-Nam to cover combat
                            actions and to make available to American and other newsmen the kind of
                            photographs that put across the stories we want told. The military have
                            agreed to do whatever is necessary.</p>

                        <p>Our ability to move on the Country-wide Information Plan depends largely
                            on the extent to which we can budge the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> to go along.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has set up a counterpart to the

                            departure from Saigon.</p>
                        <p>This represents a significant step in view of the fact that no national

                            willingness to write the Minister of Information from this end to urge

                        <p>In a June 1, 1964, memorandum to United States Information Agency
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Carl T. Rowan</persName>, Deputy
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Donald M. Wilson</persName>
                            reported on his recent trip to the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> observed:</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Union is still a land of paradox and nowhere does it show up
                            more clearly than in the information and cultural fields. Although I was
                            able to engage in some remarkably frank and free exchanges with writers,
                            artists, and even professional propagandists, the repressive hand of the
                            bureaucracy (in my case, in the form of the Ministry of Culture) was
                            never far away. On the same day, for example, I engaged in a
                            free-swinging discussion of the Sino-Soviet rift with the leaders of
                            Novosti, the ‘press service’ which serves as an overseas propaganda
                            organ of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, and then was
                            prevented by the Ministry of Culture from spending an innocuous evening
                            with the editors of a music magazine watching the Red Army Chorus
                            perform.</p>
                        <p>“This paradox of today is still a vast improvement over the Stalinist
                            orthodoxy of eight years ago. Since that time the U.S. Government has
                            slowly expanded its information and cultural activities in the Soviet
                            Union. The process has been, and still is, one of trial and error. The
                            proper approach has been, and still is, one of pushing firmly but not
                            belligerently on a number of doors marked ‘exchanges’, ‘cultural
                            presentations’, ‘radio broadcasting’, ‘magazine distribution’, and the
                            like. If the door doesn’t open, return in a while and push again. If it
                            does open, keep your foot in it and establish a program, no matter how
                            meager.</p>
                        <p>“Several years ago, our problem in the information and cultural field was
                            the basic one of identifying the opinion leaders of the Soviet Union.
                            Today, they have been identified and we are in contact with a number of
                            them. The problem now has become one of maintaining and expanding those
                            contacts.</p>

                        <p>If I sound a little miffed, it’s only because I’ve been reading all these

                                U.S. Government intelligence apparatus.</note> There wasn’t a sign
                            in any of those stories that, in turning down the mystery man, <persName corresp="#p_BWT_1">Bennett</persName> offered him the alternative of

                            book will be “The Invisible Bankbook.”</p>
                        <p>But I hope all this business about “mystery men” and books that are full
                            of security leaks doesn’t give any of you the notion that government
                            people are against the book business. We’re just hard-working patriots
                            who believe in the Constitution and the Bible. Our favorite Bible pas<pb n="48" facs="0089" xml:id="pg_48"/>sage is the one in Ecclesiastes
                            that reads: “Of making many books there is no end; and much study is a
                            weariness of the flesh.”</p>
                        <p>My 11- and 12-year-old boys give a resounding “AMEN” to the last part of
                            that verse.</p>
                        <p>And I may add with some seriousness that there is more evidence than my
                            royalty statements or your profit sheets that books have never been as
                            welcome as would be wished by those of us who regard knowledge as a

                                century French philosopher, political theorist, and writer. The
                                quote is from Rousseau’s <hi rend="italic">Emile: Or a Treatise on
                                    Education</hi> (1762).</note> “for they only teach people to
                            talk about what they do not understand.”</p>
                        <p>G. C. Lichtenberg,<note n="5" xml:id="d18fn5">Reference is to Georg
                                Christoph Lichtenberg, the German scientist and writer.</note> the
                            18th century German critic, put the matter candidly enough: “Books,
                            nowadays,” he said, “are printed by people who do not understand them,
                            sold by people who do not understand them, read and reviewed by people
                            who do not understand them, and even written by people who do not
                            understand them.”</p>
                        <p>This same cheerful gentleman, Lichtenberg, reviewing a book of his own
                            day, could only bring himself to comment: “This book has had the effect
                            which good books usually have: it has made the fools more foolish, the
                            intelligent more intelligent, and left the majority as they were.”</p>
                        <p>Benjamin Disraeli,<note n="6" xml:id="d18fn6">Prime Minister of Great

                            British politician, who, when he was not popping in and out of the Prime
                            Ministership of England, whiled away his time turning out a whole
                            shelf-full of successful novels, might have been expected to have
                            something kind to say about books; but listen to him: “Books are fatal:
                            they are the curse of the human race. Nine-tenths of existing books are
                            nonsense, and the clever books are the refutation of that nonsense. The
                            greatest misfortune that ever befell man was the invention of
                            printing.”</p>
                        <p>But surely one of the darkest moments in any author’s life occurred to
                            poor Edward Gibbon,<note n="7" xml:id="d18fn7">Eighteenth century
                                English historian.</note> when he presented a copy of the third
                            volume of his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman
                                Empire</hi> to the Duke of Gloucester, brother of George III.<note n="8" xml:id="d18fn8">Reference is to Prince William Henry.</note>
                            History has recorded the Royal Duke’s comments of that moment—and surely
                            they should stand engraved on the writing desk of any hard-working
                            author naive enough to put his trust in the permanence of literary fame:
                            “What!” shouted <pb n="49" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_49"/>the Duke, as
                            Gibbon proudly handed him his labor of love, “Another of those damned,
                            fat, square, thick books! Always scribble, scribble, scribble, eh, Mr.
                            Gibbon?”</p>
                        <p>Well, a remark that scathing from so imposing a royal critic ought—one
                            supposes—to have been the preface to the Decline and Fall of Edward
                            Gibbon. But books have a way of burying their own undertakers; and today
                            you can still buy a copy of that book, or even see a multi-million
                            dollar movie version of it—but who remembers the long-fallen and
                            apparently unlamented Duke of Gloucester?</p>
                        <p>Say what you will about books: curse them, damn them, burn them, blast
                            them—they remain one of the great, indispensable building blocks of
                            civilization . . . and a bookless world would surely be an exact and
                            terrifying synonym for an inhuman world. For it is out of books that man
                            recovers, saves, uses some of the fragments of learning that are washed
                            up in the deluge of time.</p>
                        <p>Certainly in our business in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> the
                            book bulks large.</p>
                        <p>In our mandate to further the foreign policy objectives of the United
                            States, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> uses every known tool and
                            technique of communication. We use ancient Asian morality plays—and
                            avant-garde American art. We edit neo-literate wall-newspapers—and
                            learned academic journals. We employ traveling village troubadours—and
                            orbiting relay satellites.</p>
                        <p>We use in any given case the best communication medium available to get
                            the right message to the right audience at the right time.</p>
                        <p>But though we are, and must remain, flexible in our choice of means, one
                            of the hardiest and time-tested means is the simple book.</p>
                        <p>There are, for example, our libraries, reading rooms, and bi-national
                            centers: more than 400 points of book-lending, in more than 80
                            countries, stretching from Stockholm to Stanleyville, from Tokyo to
                            Tegucigalpa.</p>
                        <p>Every year more than 30 million different people visit our libraries
                            across the world, borrowing nearly eight million volumes, and consulting
                            twice that number on the premises.</p>
                        <p>Opening a new <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library is often
                            such a local event that crowd-control becomes a problem. In Marrakech
                            the response was so overwhelming that library membership cards, limited
                            to one-day-a-week admittance, finally had to be issued.</p>
                        <p>After a month’s operation of our new library in Nyasaland, only 20
                            percent of the collection was left on the shelves: 80 percent of the
                            books had been borrowed immediately.</p>
                        <p>In Calcutta, the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library with
                            20,000 volumes does as much business as India’s National Library with
                            more than a million volumes.</p>
                        <p>To get American books into the hands of important readers in the
                            hinterland, we operate <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> traveling
                            libraries and bookmobiles in certain countries.</p>
                        <p><pb n="50" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_50"/>In Israel, the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> bookmobile was hotly pursued by a
                            police car until our worried driver finally pulled over to the side of
                            the road, and steeled himself for a ticket. “Look here!” said the two
                            earnest men in uniform as they hurried up to the car, “We’d like some
                            books, too. So don’t keep passing up our police outpost!”</p>
                        <p>A village leader in Pakistan, told politely that he had exceeded the
                            number of books a single patron could borrow at one time from the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> bookmobile, promptly rounded up his
                            nine children and checked out an additional volume in the name of each
                            child.</p>
                        <p>In Rangoon, a school teacher came 18 miles for a book on a topic her
                            class was studying. Seeing related titles on the shelves, she sighed:
                            “Ah, if only I could stay here several days and read these other books .
                            . .” Told by our librarian that she could borrow the volumes, her
                            incredulous stare of blank disbelief was broken only by the books being
                            placed physically in her hands.</p>
                        <p>When Turkey began drafting its new constitution, our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library in Ankara was asked for
                            basic works on American democratic institutions. As a result, passages
                            in the Turkish Constitution in force today are based on that reference
                                material.<note n="9" xml:id="d18fn9">On May 27, 1961, the Government

                            attorney representing Tanganyika,<note n="10" xml:id="d18fn10">Reference

                            constitutional law, in connection with proposals for a draft
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>Not only are there constant requests around the world for us to expand
                            our library activities, but whenever budget stringencies require us to
                            close a library or a reading room, there are massive petitions from the
                            local community to keep it open. Just this week I got angry protests
                            from Finland where a rumor was out that the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library would be closed.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, the whole problem with books in many parts of the
                            newly-developing world is not that books are not highly esteemed—but
                            precisely the opposite. In some places, books are esteemed much too
                            much!</p>
                        <p>In Asia, for example, our posts sometimes donate small, select
                            collections of American books to important colleges. These books are
                            received with such overwhelming gratitude that the affair is usually an
                            elaborate one, with the college rector arranging a formal ceremony of
                            acceptance before the entire assembled student body, complete with
                            garlands of flowers, a high tea, and profuse speeches all around.</p>
                        <p><pb n="51" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_51"/>But nothing is more frustrating
                            for the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officer, checking in for
                            a visit to the college a few months later, than to discover that the
                            books are almost hermetically sealed in locked glass bookcases in the
                            rector’s office . . . in absolute mint condition, untouched by human
                            hand, and even worse, unread by human eye. There the books are—proudly
                            on display—clearly regarded with immense esteem; but treasured like a
                            set of crown jewels, rather than used like a set of classroom tools.</p>
                        <p>When our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officer politely
                            remonstrates with the rector that the books don’t seem to be getting
                            much use, the rector is likely to reply in surprise, “Oh, but we keep
                            them locked in here only because we are afraid the students might steal
                            them. You know how it is: books—especially <hi rend="italic">American</hi> books—are so very valuable in our country!”</p>
                        <p>It is true. And it is a problem. There are still many parts of the world
                            where an American book has such great value that its usefulness is
                            severely compromised.</p>
                        <p>That is one reason the Model Book Store Exhibit, that your association
                            helped us put together, has been so useful to us overseas. It has been a
                            tremendous hit wherever it has traveled—and by showing in so graphic and
                            attractive a way how books are promoted and sold in America, it helps
                            open new channels of trade which will increase the sale of American
                            books abroad.</p>
                        <p>All of us in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are gratified, too,
                            at the immense success of the <gloss target="#t_ABA_1">ABA</gloss>
                            International White House Libraries Project. This effort is an
                            outstanding example of the way in which American private enterprise can
                            effectively further our national interests abroad.</p>
                        <p>And, of course, the open-shelf system in our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries overseas is another compelling and
                            contagious example of book accessibility.</p>
                        <p>But there is still another reason we are proud of our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries . . . and that is because
                            they are blown up so often!</p>
                        <p>Since 1947 we have had 58 attacks of open violence on our libraries in a
                            total of 29 countries.</p>
                        <p>As overseas agencies go, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a
                            pretty modest budget—just how modest becomes evident when one considers
                            that if we had <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s budget for a
                            single year, it would carry us along for more than 20 years; and if we
                            had the Defense Department’s budget for a single year, it would run
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> for almost four
                            centuries.</p>
                        <p>But without question, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> spends more
                            for broken window panes overseas than <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and Defense put together!</p>
                        <p>While we in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are serious about
                            economizing, we are rather proud of those broken windows. Because when
                            an emotional mob decides that it is disappointed with the United
                            States—and wants to <pb n="52" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_52"/>tell it so—it
                            usually picks out the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library as
                            the one conspicuous, well-known and well-liked symbol of the United
                            States on the main street of the city.</p>
                        <p>Our libraries are blown up—not because they aren’t appreciated (indeed,
                            the repairs are almost always paid for by an apologetic host government;
                            and sometimes even by spontaneous and unsolicited donations from the
                            readers themselves), but because in the heat of mob passion, the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library seems the most obvious and
                            frequented symbol of Uncle Sam—and is the U.S. building which most youth
                            know by location.</p>

                        <p>What is even more interesting, our libraries are blown up by elements of
                            the extreme political right as well as by elements of the extreme
                            political left.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the bombings have happened so often now that it has been
                            suggested to our Training Division that perhaps a seminar or two on
                            Demolitions Discovery, De-Fusing, and Disposal might well be sandwiched
                            in with the lectures on the Dewey Decimal System we give our lady
                            librarians.</p>
                        <p>But all things considered, there is almost a certain symbolic
                            cheerfulness in these acts of violence in our libraries. Rarely is
                            anyone hurt—and the motivation for the riots can be quite revealing. In
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHE_1">Salisbury</persName>, Rhodesia,<note n="12" xml:id="d18fn12">Reference is to the former name for the
                                Southern African country of Zimbabwe.</note> for example, a young
                            African tossed a brick through our library window. The police promptly
                            arrested him, but when they asked him why he had done it, he replied
                            with proud gusto: “Because ‘the tree of liberty must be refreshed from
                            time to time with the blood of patriots . . .’!”</p>
                        <p>The quotation, of course, is from Thomas Jefferson.<note n="13" xml:id="d18fn13">Third President of the United States from 1801
                                until 1809. The quotation is taken from a letter Jefferson wrote in
                                1787.</note> And where had this proud young African read it? In that
                            same <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library, naturally.</p>
                        <p>I don’t think this argues that we ought to take Thomas Jefferson off our
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> shelves.</p>
                        <p>I think it does argue that we can afford a few broken windows—if in the
                            end the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries can help keep
                            the American message of liberty, freedom and equality alive?</p>
                        <p><pb n="53" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_53"/>Of course, this great nation of
                            ours being such a kaleidoscope of contrasts and convictions, we have a
                            job keeping the book collections in our libraries fully representative.
                            And sometimes American tourists who drop into our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries overseas complain that we
                            have too many of this kind of book—and not enough of that kind of book;
                            or that we cover this point of view, but not that point of view; or that
                            this author is represented, but not that author—and so on.</p>
                        <p>And some U.S. tourists feel that certain of the American novels on our
                            shelves present too negative a view of American society.</p>
                        <p>Well, we work hard at keeping our book collections balanced and
                            representative, but whenever a returning tourist or Congressman
                            complains to me that some of the American novelists on our library
                            shelves present too critical a picture of the United States, I like to
                            recall a little story Robert Penn Warren<note n="14" xml:id="d18fn14">American poet, novelist, and literary critic.</note> tells about a
                            conversation he had once with an Italian Fascist who had deserted
                                <persName corresp="#p_MB_1">Mussolini</persName> in World War II,
                            and had come over to fight on our side.</p>
                        <p>Why had he done this? Warren asked him.</p>
                        <p>“Because of your American novelists,” the man replied. “The Fascists used
                            to let us read American fiction because it gave—they thought—a picture
                            of a decadent America. They thought it was good propaganda for Fascism
                            to let us read Dreiser, Faulkner, Sinclair Lewis.<note n="15" xml:id="d18fn15">References are to American writers Theodore

                            me that if democracy could allow that kind of criticism of itself, it
                            must be very strong and good. So I took to the mountains.”<note n="16" xml:id="d18fn16">The quotation is from Warren’s essay “A Lesson Read

                        <p>While the Vietnamese press continues to reflect concern with the progress
                            of the war and with what it characterizes as a “defensive” U.S. policy
                            toward Viet-Nam, there is some indication of a developing reassurance as
                            to the firmness of the U.S. commitment to Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the most recent forceful actions of the United States in
                            Southeast Asia, strong criticism of U.S. policies by the

                            unrelieved. Persistently dwelling on themes which began to be evident
                            early in 1964, the Vietnamese press generally expressed concern over the
                            “ambiguity” of U.S. policy statements, consistently castigated the U.S.
                            for “making all the decisions in Viet-Nam” and/or expressed fear that
                            the United States will abandon South Viet-Nam.</p>

                            attitudes. In fact, by May 1964 press opinion seemed to have reached a
                            low point of pessimism. Typically, <hi rend="italic">Dan Quyen</hi>
                            declared on May 13 that “when the <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> delegation came here in March, the situation in
                            South Viet-Nam was not as critical as it is today.” Indirectly reflected
                            in this attitude was the belief that the United States must adopt a
                            stronger policy, but that—in view of the election year—it was unlikely
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>In the past few days, however, Vietnamese press attitudes have shown
                            signs of change, apparently in response to the overflights in <pb n="55" facs="0096" xml:id="pg_55"/>Laos<note n="5" xml:id="d19fn5">In May
                                1964, the United States started flying reconnaissance flights over

                            stronger U.S. show of strength in Southeast Asia. With most Saigon
                            newspapers viewing renewed Communist aggression in the neighboring
                            kingdom as part of the overall red design to conquer all of Southeast
                            Asia, Saigon dailies have spoken out editorially in full support of U.S.
                            actions in the new crisis. The influential Chinese-language <hi rend="italic">Thang Cong Jih Pao</hi>, which on May 7 had bitterly
                            complained that the United States did not want to take “decisive action”
                            against the Communists because it wanted “a peaceful, pre-election
                            breathing spell, had by June 9 lined up with U.S. action and proclaimed
                            “the world-wide communist front is indivisible.”</p>
                        <p>Other leading papers have shown similar confidence, and while it is
                            obviously too early to predict that the short-term comment so far
                            available from Saigon marks a trend, it is significant that caustic
                            criticism of the U.S. no longer goes unchallenged in Viet-Nam. Thus,
                            while the <hi rend="italic">Saigon Post</hi> recently expressed dismay
                            at the “gullible and naive” attitude of the U.S. in “once more resorting
                            merely to raising the quota of economic and military aid,” <hi rend="italic">A Chau Jih Pao</hi> voiced a strong note of
                            reassurance on June 10.</p>
                        <p>“It is still premature to tell what change Southeast Asia will undergo,”
                            declares <hi rend="italic">A Chau</hi>, “but one thing is certain: the
                            United States would never abandon Southeast Asia, nor will she make any
                            withdrawal from this part of the world.”</p>

                        <p>As in Viet-Nam, the basic problem continues to be security. However, also
                            as in Viet-Nam, a military solution will not be possible unless an
                            energetic political, psychological, and informational campaign is
                            promptly undertaken designed to obtain the active support of the local
                            tribal leaders and their followers to the central government.</p>
                        <p>I am readying <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> for the need to make
                            an all-out informational-psychological effort in the Congo, and for a
                            more effective program in the rest of Africa. The following actions have
                            already been taken:</p>
                        <p>1) Radio Congo is the principal means of communication between the
                            government of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AC_1">Adoula</persName> and the people of the country. Upon learning that
                            Radio Congo’s studio equipment was in critical need of repair (only
                            three of eight studios capable of operation), I immediately authorized
                            transfer of funds and resources from less critical programs to be used
                            to repair facilities on an emergency basis. I also assigned a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> radio engineer to the Congo to take
                            charge of this operation.</p>
                        <p>2) I have transferred one of my senior and most able officers (John W.
                            Mowinckel) from Paris to Leopoldville,<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">Reference is to the former name for Kinshasa, the capital of the
                                Democratic Republic of Congo.</note> where he will be in charge of
                            our field operations. He will be on duty in early July.</p>
                        <p>3) I have appointed a new Area Director for Africa, <persName corresp="#p_LMB_1">Mark Lewis</persName>, who most recently was
                            Public Affairs Officer in Ghana. <persName corresp="#p_LMB_1">Lewis</persName> is a top-notch officer with considerable African
                            experience who is highly regarded by all of our Ambassadors with whom he
                            has served. He has drive and imagination, both vitally needed in the
                            direction of a program for Africa. I have instructed <persName corresp="#p_LMB_1">Lewis</persName> to go to the Congo to review the
                            situation and to report to me personally on steps we need to take.</p>

                                asserted: “We will continue to build bridges across the gulf which
                                has divided us from Eastern Europe. They will be bridges of
                                increased trade, of ideas, of visitors, and of humanitarian aid.”

                            <p>While the Department of State and other U.S. Government agencies will
                                undoubtedly concern themselves with the political, economic and
                                commercial implications of United States policy toward the countries
                                of Eastern Europe as enunciated by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> in his recent Lexington,
                                Virginia speech,<note n="5" xml:id="d21fn5">See <ref target="#d21fn2">footnote 2</ref>, above.</note> it is
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s particular
                                responsibility and opportunity to consider the psychological
                                implications and to build informational and cultural bridges.</p>
                            <p>The psychological approach is particularly important in creating the
                                atmosphere necessary for establishing more substantial and concrete
                                relations in fields of greatest interest to us. Conversely, the
                                unrest—intellectual, economic, political and ideological—existing
                                within the countries of Eastern Europe today provides us with
                                opportunities to bring these people ideas and information from the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p><pb n="58" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_58"/>We must first seek to <hi rend="italic">reach</hi> the opinion leaders in Eastern Europe
                                with the information we want them to have and to interpret it for
                                them. Our major goals should be to encourage liberalization within
                                the countries of Eastern Europe, to further evolution away from
                                political repression toward societies in which the leadership
                                responds to the will of the people. Information and ideas will also
                                help reestablish the traditional ties with the West which the people
                                of Eastern Europe have been virtually denied during recent
                                years.</p>
                            <p>In considering programs in which we now engage, activities which we
                                envisage for the near future and plans which we have on a long-range
                                basis, we make first the following general observations:</p>
                            <p>1. Some of our information and cultural activities—such as, for
                                instance, the Voice of America—need no agreement by the respective
                                governments and operate without it. Others do need their permission,
                                but we believe that our goals can best be achieved without resorting
                                to the negotiation of formal written agreements. We can probably do
                                best by operating on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> basis as we
                                presently do in Poland, by being flexible in our approach and by
                                taking advantage of opportunities as they arise.</p>
                            <p>2. The United States stands to gain both by the exposure of American
                                intellectuals and opinion leaders to the people of Eastern Europe
                                and by the exposure of Eastern European men and women of influence
                                to this country.</p>
                            <p>3. The Eastern European governments should be made to realize that
                                the conduct of cultural and informational activities is consistent
                                with normal friendly relations between countries and that these
                                activities are our part of a <hi rend="italic">quid-pro-quo</hi> for
                                something they want. There should be at least tacit understanding on
                                the part of these governments that our diplomatic missions will have
                                free access to officials and private citizens in the pursuit of
                                legitimate cultural activities and that the citizens of the
                                respective countries will have access to the cultural activities of
                                the U.S. missions (library, film showings, English classes) without
                                running the risk of harassment by local authorities. The missions of
                                the Eastern European countries in Washington already enjoy analogous
                                access here.</p>
                            <p>4. Our targets are those individuals in Eastern Europe who now and in
                                the future will guide public opinion and attitudes. These include
                                party and government officials, managers and “technocrats”, youth
                                leaders, publicists and the intellectual elite. In communicating
                                with the intellectual elite—the writers, creative artists and
                                academicians—we must, however, strike a careful balance: On one
                                hand, we want to encourage the “dissident” elements, those
                                avant-gardists who are out of favor but who are bringing new life
                                into intellectualism in Eastern Europe. On the other hand, we do not
                                want to give them the kiss of <pb n="59" facs="0100" xml:id="pg_59"/>death by singling them out for attention. But neither do we want
                                to ignore the moderates among the intellectuals—as opposed to the
                                reactionaries—these moderates being responsible for some of the
                                liberalization which already has been achieved.</p>
                            <p>Following is a summary of our present activities and future
                                recommendations:</p>
                            <p>1. Radio. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> already broadcasts in
                                all the Eastern European languages and no increase is contemplated.
                                However, we are making constant efforts to make our programs more
                                effective in terms of our present foreign policy objectives. <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> remains the single most important
                                source of news from the United States and information about it. Now
                                that jamming has ceased in all countries but Bulgaria, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s potential has greatly
                                increased.</p>
                            <p>2. Publications.</p>
                            <p>a. We should push for agreement for the sale of a prestige American
                                publication such as <hi rend="italic">Amerika</hi><note n="6" xml:id="d21fn6">Reference is to a Russian-language <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> publication distributed in
                                    the Soviet Union.</note> (already being distributed in
                                Poland—32,000 copies, and in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—62,000 copies monthly). This type of publication
                                would serve in place of commercially-published American periodicals,
                                unless and until these are freely distributed in Eastern Europe. The
                                United States would agree to the sale in this country of reciprocal
                                publications.</p>
                            <p>b. We will push for publication of a Cultural Bulletin in Hungary and
                                Czechoslovakia (as we now distribute in the other countries) and of
                                a Science Bulletin (already being distributed in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>)—both in local languages. These
                                bulletins give up-to-date news of events and accomplishments in the
                                cultural and technical-scientific fields.</p>
                            <p>c. We should press to obtain wider circulation of Embassy daily
                                information bulletins to editors, journalists and government
                                officials and of press releases to these same individuals and to
                                others who might be assumed to have special interest in a given
                                press release.</p>
                            <p>d. We should continue judicious distribution of presentation
                                materials—such as publications, films and elements for display—at
                                the request of local citizens and organizations.</p>
                            <p>e. We should press officially and privately at all appropriate levels
                                for sales of our commercial publications—books, periodicals,
                                newspapers—in the countries of Eastern Europe thereby to achieve a
                                freer flow of information.</p>
                            <p>3. Exhibits.</p>
                            <p><pb n="60" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_60"/>a. We should continue to
                                participate in international trade fairs in Eastern Europe and
                                expand to include other trade fairs since they are an excellent
                                platform from which to show the U.S. flag.</p>
                            <p>b. We should try to expand our current program of major solo exhibits
                                such as those in plastics, transportation, communications, graphics,
                                and medicine which will have been shown already successfully in some
                                Eastern European countries (Rumania, Poland, Bulgaria).</p>
                            <p>4. Reading Rooms. In spite of categoric opposition to date by the
                                Eastern European governments to the establishment of reciprocal
                                reading rooms (or information centers), we should continue to press
                                for them. We should stress that such reading rooms are part of
                                normal diplomatic establishments in countries maintaining friendly
                                relations with one another.</p>
                            <p>5. English Teaching Assistance. Since there is great interest in
                                Eastern Europe in learning English, we believe that we can promote
                                American ideas through this means. We are doing some of this now
                                through the publication of the “English Teaching Forum”,<note n="7" xml:id="d21fn7">Reference is to a quarterly magazine publication
                                    first published by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in
                                    1963.</note> through loans of language laboratories, and through
                                participation in English teaching seminars.</p>
                            <p>6. Television and Radio. We should continue to try to place on
                                Eastern European <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> networks
                                especially produced and targeted American <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> and radio programs, including cultural features and
                                possibly English teaching materials. We should also encourage
                                American commercial and educational radio and <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> networks to offer appropriate
                                programs to these countries.</p>
                            <p>We should likewise encourage exchanges between the Eastern European
                                International Broadcasting and Television Organization and the
                                European Broadcasting Union.</p>
                            <p>7. Exchanges of People. One of the most effective means of
                                strengthening ties between the people of Eastern Europe and the
                                United States is an increased and free flow of individuals and
                                groups of individuals—tourists, relatives, businessmen, teachers and
                                students, or specialists in various fields visiting their
                                counterparts. We should push particularly exchanges in the
                                intellectual and cultural fields among writers, artists,
                                journalists, educators, and youth leaders.</p>
                            <p>8. Exchanges with Western Europe. Since, as the President stated, we
                                must work “. . . to demonstrate that identity of interest and the
                                prospects of progress for Eastern Europe lie in a wider relationship
                                with the West”, we should seize every opportunity to encourage the
                                Western European countries to build similar bridges using methods
                                delineated above and others which may be available to them.</p>

                        <p>Non-Communist editors universally and extensively acclaimed the event as
                            marking an historic advance. Acclaim is accompanied by warnings that
                            passage of the legislation will not immediately or easily bring equality
                            for the Negro and expectations of continued bitter strife and resistance
                            are widespread.</p>
                        <p>Along with cautions against expectation of immediate results are some
                            hopes that strife will henceforth be moderated. The long debate
                            heightened attention to the racial question and increased the dramatic
                            impact of the Senate’s action. Tribute is paid to your skill, courage,
                            and authority in bringing about the bill’s passage.</p>
                        <p>Commentators viewed the passage as the most important step forward in the
                            American Negro’s struggle for equality since the Emancipation
                                Proclamation;<note n="4" xml:id="d22fn4">Reference is to the
                                proclamation made by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863,
                                in which he declared “that all persons held as slaves” within the
                                rebellious states “are, and henceforth shall be free.”</note> as a
                            “victory” that will “shape the future of the United States”; as a
                            “turning point” in American history; as enhancing the international
                            influence of the United States, especially among the non-white and
                            newly-independent nations; and as reinforcing the moral authority of the
                            United States and its dedication to freedom and social justice.</p>
                        <p>Soviet treatment has sought to downplay the importance of the Senate’s
                            action, stressing the “immense distance” between the legislation and its
                            realization, predicting the continuance of racial clashes and <pb n="62" facs="0103" xml:id="pg_62"/>high-lighting current racial
                            difficulties. No comment from Peking or other Communist areas in the Far
                            East is available.</p>
                        <p>A summary of regional comment follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Western Europe</p>
                        <p>Senate passage of the civil rights bill received prominent news coverage
                            in Western Europe and, especially in Britain, Scandinavia and Austria,
                            extensive editorial comment as well. Material currently available
                            indicates that, with a few prominent exceptions, French and West German
                            reaction has not been so extensive. Most see the Senate action as a
                            turning point in U.S. history and give credit to you and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>. At the same time,
                            the majority is either skeptical or pessimistic over prospects for
                            peaceful and early acceptance of the measure.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Africa</p>
                        <p>The African press has responded to Senate passage of the civil rights
                            bill with prominent coverage and enthusiastic comment. Papers in seven
                            African countries described the bill as a major step forward in the
                            Negroes’ drive for equality but recognized that the bill’s passage did
                            not mean the end of racial discrimination in America. While editors
                            censured Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_FO_1">Faubus</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_WG_1">Wallace</persName> for impeding racial progress,
                            they praised the American people, the U.S. Senate, and you and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> for your combined
                            efforts in achieving victory. The U.S. was seen as implementing its
                            democratic principles.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Near East and South Asia</p>
                        <p>Commentators in widely separate centers in both the Near East and South
                            Asia generally regard the passage of the Senate civil rights bill as an
                            historic turning point in the battle for equal opportunity in the United
                            States. Some papers see the measure as a memorial to the late President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>, while others credit
                            your Administration. Most temper their praise, however, by warning that
                            enforcement problems are apt to dilute the full effect of the
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Far East</p>
                        <p>The Far East press enthusiastically applauded the Senate passage of the
                            civil rights bill. Editorially, the action was welcomed as certain to
                            improve the U.S. image abroad and as a badly needed answer to Communist
                            charges of officially-sanctioned racial persecution in the United
                            States. While only a few editorialists in the area expressed fear that
                            the bill might lead to increased civil rights strife, a number noted
                            that the legislation in itself was not enough and needed popular support
                            and cooperation. The bill was generally described as a monument to the
                            late President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> and a
                            political triumph for you.</p>

                            America</p>
                        <p>The Latin American press has given wire service news treatment to the
                            Senate’s passage of the civil rights bill. In addition there was
                            substantial editorial comment for a few days. The tone of the comment
                            was almost universally favorable and laudatory. The principal theme has
                            been the resultant enhancing of the international prestige of the U.S.
                            and the influence the law-to-be will have on the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Union</p>
                        <p>Senate passage of the civil rights bill drew a considerable volume of
                            Soviet commentary attempting to minimize the importance of the
                            legislation, although <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and several other
                            newspapers have ignored the event. Moscow Radio immediately broadcast a
                            brief, factual account of the vote to both foreign and domestic
                            audiences. The follow-up <gloss target="#t_TASS_1">TASS</gloss> dispatch
                            from Washington outlined the many hurdles the bill had overcome before
                            passage and concluded that while “racists” had suffered a defeat in
                            Congress, they would continue to struggle in their home states against
                            implementation of the law. Occasionally conceding that passage of the
                            civil rights bill marks “a certain success” for the struggle of American
                            Negroes for equal rights, the Soviet press and radio have continued to
                            spotlight incidents such as those in St. Augustine.</p>

                        <p>On July 1, 1964, Director of the United States Information Agency
                                <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Carl Rowan</persName>, in his official
                            statement before the Senate Subcommittee of the Committee on
                            Appropriations, stated: “I do not think I am being overly dramatic
                            today, Mr. Chairman, when I say that the Nation’s need for this Agency
                            to do an adequate, even inspired, job has never been greater.” He
                            continued:</p>
                        <p>“The fires of conflict burn in southeast Asia; the winds of
                            disillusionment blow on every continent; our adversaries are spreading
                            the seeds of discontent, of hostility toward the institutions of freedom
                            that we seek to preserve in Latin America and wherever frustrated men
                            will listen.”</p>
                        <p>I know that you of this committee understand that we have no choice but
                            to use every feasible means of communication—radio, television, motion
                            pictures, books, newspapers, pamphlets, and the force of the knowledge
                            and personalities of our people overseas—to insure that no man chooses
                            tyranny because we have defaulted in telling freedom’s story.</p>
                        <p>“Mindful that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s fundamental reason
                            for existence is to tell that story, to advance the foreign policy
                            interests of the United States, I have undertaken a zealous campaign to
                            insure that every foot of film, every minute of broadcasting, every
                            stick of type that is set in our name, goes to portray this country’s
                            strength, its dedication to human freedom, its social progress, its
                            economic vitality, its belief in the rule of law—and most of all the
                            yearning for world peace that guides its every effort.” (See, for
                            example, the USIA film, <hi rend="italic">The President and the
                                Press</hi>, <ref target="#appendix-2">Appendix A.2</ref>.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> continued: “There have been
                            two foreign policy developments recently that point up dramatically the
                            magnitude of the current challenge to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. The first is the easing of tensions between the
                            United States and a portion of the Communist bloc; the second is the
                            Sino-Soviet split.</p>
                        <p>“In backing away from the Cuban confrontation to a posture of ‘peaceful
                            coexistence,’ <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> stated
                            emphatically that there can be ‘no ideological coexistence,’ so the
                            Soviet propaganda apparatus is busier today perhaps than in the worst
                            days of East-West tension.”</p>
                        <p>“The fact is,” <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> further
                            stated, “the Sino-Soviet split imposes upon <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> a demand for greater activity and greater zeal, for in
                            their efforts to outdo each other, the Soviet Union and Red China each
                            has intensified its propaganda campaign, particularly in the
                            underdeveloped areas where they boast that they will ‘bury us’—each in
                            its preferred way.</p>
                        <p>“Not only have we added and altered broadcasts and sharpened other
                            elements of our program to meet this challenge, but we are taking <pb n="65" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_65"/>on new responsibilities and
                            devising new techniques to meet crisis situations abroad.</p>
                        <p>“For example, we have increased our broadcasting in Vietnamese from our
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> facilities in the Philippines,
                            and in a few weeks we will add three 50-kilowatt shortwave transmitters
                            to our Philippines complex so as to strengthen by 40 percent this
                            country’s shortwave voice in southeast Asia. In mid-June the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will be relayed strongly into all of
                            Vietnam over a new medium-wave transmitter that is being constructed in
                            South Vietnam in cooperation with the Department of Defense.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> concluded: “In short, Mr.
                            Chairman, we are determined that our friends not be confused, or the
                            doubtful misled, because we, either through lethargy or a misguided
                            notion of economy, have failed to state this country’s case.” (<hi rend="italic">Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, The

                            aggression is a responsibility which all nations should share. To meet
                            this need, the Agency must make a maximum effort through all media and
                            in all possible countries to achieve the following objectives:</p>
                        <p>(1) to explain the nature and significance of the struggle,</p>
                        <p>(2) to expose the evil of communist aims and actions,</p>
                        <p>(3) to stress the collective responsibility which other nations must
                            share to stop them,</p>
                        <p>(4) to publicize third nation participation and support, and</p>
                        <p>(5) to keep before world opinion U.S. determination to persist in its
                            support of those Southeast Asian nations which have requested our
                            assistance until the communist aggression is checked.</p>
                        <p><pb n="68" facs="0109" xml:id="pg_68"/>We should all keep in mind that
                            the communists view their aggression in Southeast Asia as a test case
                            for “wars of national liberation” and that a communist victory there
                            would sharply increase the likelihood of future such adventures
                            elsewhere. We should strive to create in the minds of our audience a
                            sense of individual identification with the struggle against communism
                            in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>In an August 5, 1964, memorandum, United States Information Agency
                            Director <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Carl T. Rowan</persName>,
                            summarized for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon B.
                                Johnson</persName> the international media’s initial reactions to
                            United States military action in retaliation to reports that North
                            Vietnamese patrol boats had fired upon two U.S. naval vessels, the USS
                                <hi rend="italic">Maddox</hi> and USS <hi rend="italic">Turner
                                Joy</hi>, on August 2 and 4. According to <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>, “Far East comment sees the
                            situation in Viet-Nam as grave and there are indications of concern and
                            some anxiety but nothing approaching panic.” However, Western European
                            media viewed “the American moves in Southeast Asia as retaliation
                            against deliberate North Vietnamese attacks.” (Johnson Library, White
                            House Central Files, Subject Files, Countries, EX CO 312, Box CO–79, CO
                            312 Viet Nam 6/15/64–9/30/64)</p>
                        <p>In a memorandum the following day, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> that “the mood of world comment currently is
                            sober, watchful, and concerned, and hopes are strongly expressed that
                            the conflict will not broaden. U.S. action is generally viewed as
                            justified, and praised for ‘firmness and restraint.’” (Ibid.) In an
                            August 7 memorandum further assessing the on-going international media
                            attention, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> noted:
                            “Strongly favorable initial acceptance of U.S. actions in the Gulf of
                            Tonkin has now been tempered by more concern and increasing doubts about
                            those actions.” He further informed <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, “General approval, tempered by sober thoughts
                            on escalation, is still coming in from Far Eastern countries,
                            particularly the Philippines and Taiwan.” Although European media
                            continued to view U.S. actions as necessary, “more attention is being
                            given to U.S. domestic implications” and that <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> had “‘succumbed to a <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> policy’” was appearing in
                            mostly leftist European media. (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On August 10, <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> signed into
                            law the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (<gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>
                            88–408; 78 <gloss target="#t_Stat_1">Stat.</gloss> 384), which
                            authorized him to take any necessary steps, including the use of armed
                            force, to repel any military attack against the forces of the United
                            States and to prevent future aggression. For additional information

                        <p>Operations of a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Information or
                            Cultural Center, America House, library, reading room, binational
                            center, book-extension collection or other book deposits have been
                            described in detail in the Agency’s <gloss target="#t_MOA_1">MOA</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> Handbook, plus various
                            circular messages and other communications to the field in the last
                            decade. This message, therefore, is not intended to repeat basic
                            operating procedures but rather to provide a refresher for all American
                            officers and national employees on the utilization of books, periodicals
                            and other “center” resources so that they will be more purposeful in
                            carrying out Agency and country plan objectives.</p>
                        <p>From personal observations and study by senior Agency officers who have
                            visited and inspected our posts, and discussions in Washington with
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s, <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>’s, librarians and other officers being debriefed, we
                            have concluded that our libraries abroad have not kept up sufficiently
                            with the improved and changing educational and communications situations
                            in their countries or in their areas. This requires a new hard look by
                            the posts, particularly by each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, at
                            centers and their program-content potential in terms of country plan
                            objectives. Adjustments in collections, in ordering for targeting
                            purposes, in selection methods by posts and in book promotion may be in
                            order to revitalize library activities. These would go beyond the
                            weeding-out process which is natural for any library; these adjustments
                            would call for weighing the value of each title in relation to the
                            post’s specific needs for <pb n="71" facs="0112" xml:id="pg_71"/>carrying out country objectives and for putting emphasis where it
                            needs to be. Books of lesser importance which seem to have assumed a
                            permanency in the collection may have to be discarded and replaced by
                            titles of greater importance.</p>
                        <p>It’s time for a conscientious review of the library investment. To assist
                            each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> to make this review, the
                            Agency offers these guidelines:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Purpose and Scope</p>
                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library is established to
                            provide basic information and to supply source material about the United
                            States. Books are purveyors of ideas, and books and libraries have a
                            definite place to further our objectives.</p>
                        <p>In appearance and operations, a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            library is similar to a public library. However, unlike a public
                            library, the purpose of the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            library is not the general diffusion of knowledge. It is not a
                            substitute for any local public library, however willing the local
                            government may be to have us assume that responsibility. Our libraries
                            are neither a recreational reading oasis nor a scholarly research
                            center. The <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library exists for a
                            special purpose: to promote U.S. objectives.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, different areas and different countries represent different
                            problems and thus call for different documentation. Some libraries may
                            need to be more sophisticated culturally than others, depending on the
                            reading habits and capacities of the audience; others may need to
                            concentrate on more basic materials, depending on the degree of open
                            communications and commercial channels between our country and the host

                        <p>What goes into each library and how well the books are promoted is the
                            responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>. We have
                            reason to believe that in the press of other matters, the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> may have delegated this responsibility
                            to other officers (in many cases, junior officers) or to a local
                            librarian and thus may not have been in a position to direct the library
                            program in such a way that its materials and services reach selected
                            audience groups with the right titles at the right time. The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> should control the special-purpose
                            character of his books and should not rely on persons with lesser policy
                            judgment on how to utilize the collection. In the latter case, this can
                            and has resulted in off-balance collections in the light of the Agency’s
                            five major points of emphasis and its five major Americana themes, as
                            well as specific country plan needs.</p>
                        <p>It is the Agency’s feeling that each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>, America House and
                            binational center director and other American officers should give more
                            personal attention to the library and its contents as the center of
                            information and cultural operations on which a country program can
                            revolve. The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> is the key officer in
                            policy application; the librarian is the follow-up action officer.</p>

                        <p>Each library collection should provide a wide selection of responsible
                            works on American life and culture, emphasizing those aspects which
                            facilitate sympathetic understanding of United States policies.</p>
                        <p>Books are primarily selected on the basis of content. Every book on the
                            shelves of a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library should have
                            a pertinent program reason for being there—this should be our yardstick.
                            Periodically, program-content inventory should be taken and each book
                            considered for retention on its merits for meeting specific program
                            needs. No book should be guaranteed a permanent place on the shelf.</p>
                        <p>Book selection for each library is decentralized to field posts. The
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> should take an active part in selecting titles for
                            center collections; a recommended approach is for each post to establish
                            a “Book Committee” chaired by the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>
                            or <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>, which must approve each book
                            for which orders will be placed through <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> or locally-procured.</p>
                        <p>To assist posts in the selection process, <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> makes available lists of recommended books, subject
                            bibliographies and special book lists. The <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> Current Recommended Book Lists will hereafter carry
                            “built-in guidance” on new books by identifying titles by events or
                            themes of most recent concern and thus worthy of special handling. These
                            lists will single out audiences we especially want to reach with the
                            book. In addition, <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> issues regularly
                            each month—or more frequently, if required—a Special Book List on a
                            leading thematic subject, which lists from 10 to 30 recommended books to
                            receive priority book promotion in and outside our libraries.
                            Frequently, the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and Embassy staff
                            can call attention to these titles in their contact work.</p>
                        <p>Posts, of course, can draw on other bibliographic sources in selecting
                            additional titles they require to support Agency themes.</p>
                        <p>While there is no desire by the Agency to reduce support for libraries
                            and centers, posts will have to find the means to make adjustments in
                            their collections without additional financing. We strongly recommend
                            that posts eliminate some titles, cut down on multiple copies and not
                            re-order less important items to provide the funds. The post will then
                            be able to increase the number of more important books, without
                            increasing the over-all costs for book purchases.</p>
                        <p>To reshape our libraries along contemporary lines and to fill the gaps,
                            we suggest:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Substantially reduce popular fiction
                                collections</hi>. At some posts, these vary from 10 to 45 per cent
                            of the total collections. We consider this out of proportion. At posts
                            where American popular titles are accessible through commercial
                            bookstores, public libraries or schools and universities, fiction should
                            be pared down to a minimum of titles, representa<pb n="73" facs="0114" xml:id="pg_73"/>tive of the best in the contemporary American novel.
                            Even at posts where the book gap is large, we should be highly
                            selective. Each year, posts should limit selection to a maximum of 30 or
                            40 representative titles of new fiction recommended by <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(b) While cutting down on popular fiction, we should build up a good
                            collection of the <hi rend="italic">American classics of
                            literature</hi>. This should be basic in every <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library. <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> will
                            issue a catalogue of basic American classics which should be checked
                            against your collection.</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Support of American Studies courses</hi> in
                            secondary schools and universities has become an increasingly important
                            library function. The American Studies collection should give special
                            attention to history, political science and economics, in addition to
                            the traditional emphasis on American classics of literature. Too many
                            posts are overloaded with expensive books on the fine arts, theater,
                            literary criticism, etc., and the humanities; these definitely have a
                            place in the library but when ordering new titles or re-ordering old
                            titles, thought should be given to the development of a good, but <hi rend="italic">token</hi> collection of such items, sufficient to
                            meet most needs. Without sacrificing balance, the post may find it could
                            use the money more gainfully for titles more directly in line with
                            policy objectives. (See <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> Special
                            List 5/63 of June 1963.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">Not

                            remains one of our major themes and this should be adequately reflected
                            in all collections. Books on these subjects are very popular in many
                            countries, especially among university students, and should be given
                            special attention by the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> and his
                            senior staff. If there is a Science Attache at the post, seek his advice
                            on documentation.</p>
                        <p>While a well-rounded science collection would seem to be mandatory at
                            each post, <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s should weigh carefully
                            the extent to which the library should carry any highly specialized
                            collection such as medical books, which are expensive and which reach a
                            very small audience. Among factors in deciding on such a collection
                            should be (a) the cost in relation to more thematic titles, (b) the
                            availability of the books on the commercial market and/or in the
                            university. Book orders of specialized items could be justified only on
                            the basis of the audience being of such importance to our objectives as
                            to warrant special attention in the country plan.</p>
                        <p>(e) Books specifically written for <hi rend="italic">children</hi> under
                            14 years of age should not be included in a collection unless they are
                            particularly useful in promoting U.S. objectives and, in such cases,
                            they should be justified in the country plan. We believe that certain
                            titles of American history, biography, literature, and even popular
                            fiction written for the less-<pb n="74" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_74"/>advanced reader (juvenile series, for example) could be purposefully
                            used in the library for young people or as easy-reading for adults with
                            limited knowledge of English. We feel that we should try to reach
                            secondary-school students from 14 years old upwards, with selective
                            titles. They should be in the formative years of political awareness. It
                            is difficult to envisage tiny-tots or grade-school children as priority
                            target audiences; the money for children’s books can be used more
                            gainfully to fill book gaps for young adult and adult audiences.</p>
                        <p>(f) Libraries at posts with <hi rend="italic">English-teaching
                                programs</hi>, particularly <gloss target="#t_BNC_1">BNC</gloss>
                            libraries, should have a wide and representative selection of graded
                            readings for English-language students, as well as source materials,
                            such as books on linguistics and methodology for teachers. This special
                            collection should be labeled as such and it is to be expected that there
                            would be duplication of titles in the regular collection. An
                            English-teaching book item should be a means of introducing American
                            history and social, economic and political thought insofar as possible.
                            Attention is called to titles published under the Agency’s Ladder Book
                                program.<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">See <ref target="#d2fn13">footnote 13, Document 2</ref>.</note> Appropriate titles also

                        <p>(g) The <hi rend="italic">extension collections, book lockers</hi> and
                            other depositories should be given the same attention as our own
                            libraries in the book-selection process. A study has disclosed that some
                            posts are using these techniques as a means for making American books
                            available without sufficient regard for basic purposes and objectives.
                            Most current collections are top-heavy with fiction; there should be
                            more attention to basic books on American history, biography and some
                            political matters. We should promote titles in which we have a
                            particular interest. <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s should
                            direct the composition of these loan collections and posts should make
                            frequent suggestions of specific titles to indigenous librarians
                            operating the extensions. This selection responsibility should not be
                            delegated to local employees.</p>
                        <p>Evaluations of the usefulness of the extensions and book lockers must be
                            made on a regular basis to determine that the current program potential
                                <hi rend="italic">and the impact</hi> of these collections on the
                            community where a depository is located justify continuation. The post
                            may decide not to withdraw an inactive collection for various reasons,
                            but further support should be cut off if the investment is not
                            productive from a <pb n="75" facs="0116" xml:id="pg_75"/>program-content
                            viewpoint. We should not permit the use of deposits as decorative
                            American shelf acquisitions.</p>
                        <p>(h) We believe that our libraries have a relatively low proportion of <hi rend="italic">books in the local language</hi>. This should be
                            remedied. With the marked increase in output of the Agency’s
                            book-translation programs in recent years, <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s should build up the local language portion of the
                            collections. Posts should not only use Agency-sponsored translations but
                            also other available local-language titles which support our objectives.
                            The post’s book committee should apply the same criteria to local
                            procurement of books as to titles in English.</p>
                        <p>(i) A book’s success as a policy-application item depends on how it has
                            been handled—this we call <hi rend="italic">book promotion</hi>. Some
                            posts seem to devote less attention to this important activity than they
                            should. The book’s content and author must be introduced to potential
                            readers, in particular the special audiences we are trying to reach.
                            Individuals on the post’s leader lists who would be particularly
                            interested in a new book or with whom a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> or Embassy staff member has had a discussion, could be
                            sent a new title under cover of a letter explaining that it was not a
                            presentation item but a new library book which they might like to read
                            and return.</p>
                        <p>Every library has or should have display space. New significant titles,
                            plus those on each of the <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> Special Book Lists</hi> on themes, should be
                            prominently—but not blatantly—displayed. Photographs from the books, of
                            the authors and of current events associated with the theme should be
                            combined with book covers. The introductory page of each of these
                            special book lists summarizes the purpose of the books and the theme and
                            should provide several pegs on which to develop the post’s
                            ingenuity.</p>
                        <p>Too often, monthly bulletins or pamphlets distributed by posts to
                            announce new book acquisitions are deadly. In the attempt to maintain a
                            certain “cultural dignity” the bulletins are dull and unimaginative and
                            hardly conducive to evoking interest in books with special program
                            value. We need attractive pamphlets, with eye-catching make-up and
                            either illustrated with book jackets or other inexpensive graphic work.
                            The Agency suggests posts take a look at <hi rend="italic">Publishers’

                            be used as a selection guide. In the annual review required for ordering
                            periodicals, the post’s book committee should check the list of
                            periodicals to make certain that the fields of political, international
                            and economic affairs, as well as other serious publications, are given
                            their proper weight. The availability of the popular-type American
                            magazine on the commercial market should also serve as a guiding factor.
                            Multiple copies of most magazines should be discouraged.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library, or center, should
                            combine the best American library practices with active information
                            services to provide special audiences with materials and documentation
                            designed to expose them to those points of emphasis made in the country
                            plan, as well as the priorities on American life and culture. While all
                            center services and programs are freely available to the public, we give
                            special consideration to individuals, organizations and institutions
                            listed in your country plan as primary target audiences. To this end,
                            services should be supplied as follows:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Reference service:</hi> It may be desirable for
                            some posts in countries well supplied with public and university
                            libraries and well-stocked bookstores to give more attention to this
                            part of operations, rather than to the conventional lending-library
                            service. The reference service should aim to provide factual and
                            interpretive information to government officials, educators, students,
                            news media, professionals, leaders and others. To be able to supply this
                            documentation, the library resources should be organized to provide a
                            “reference-and-research” section, specially tailored to meet such needs.
                            This may require diverting resources from the popular fiction-lending
                            section, from the social sciences and from the fine arts section, etc.,
                            although a representative collection of all these should be maintained
                            for lending purposes.</p>
                        <p>Some posts where university students are a key audience group and where
                            there are American Studies courses in the schools, should have a special
                            “American Studies Section” in the library which would be a complete
                            study center for history, political science and economics, as well as
                            literature, and which would offer special long-term lending
                            privileges.</p>
                        <p>The telephone and mail requests for information have bedeviled posts with
                            an overabundance of “quiz-type” questions. Obviously, the origins of
                            these cannot be controlled. However, librarians should be instructed to
                            spend less time on these questions. In one major post, an <pb n="77" facs="0118" xml:id="pg_77"/>extraordinarily large percentage of the
                            reference-service man-hours has been consumed by quiz questions; at
                            another post, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> has arranged with
                            the public library system to take over this activity and refer only
                            those questions to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> beyond the ken
                            of the public library. Posts should find a way to tactfully deal with
                            this vexing problem.</p>
                        <p>When replying to written inquiries, we should take the liberty of
                            enclosing book-promotion materials which will broaden reader interests
                            to include subjects relevant to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Music:</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> no longer automatically sends out
                            scores of American music, except to 25 posts which have shown need for
                            the product. From personal inspection and from talks with returning
                            American officers, we gather that some scores are dormant in <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> centers. We recommend that the
                            scores either be incorporated into the library reference service and
                            limited for lending purpose to conductors, music teachers and students,
                            or else loaned on a long-term basis to conservatories or schools which
                            have shown evidence of interest in contemporary American music.</p>
                        <p>Posts should consider similar action on musical recordings, which are to
                            be used for group educational purposes rather than for straight
                            entertainment for individuals or groups. Tapes which are part of lecture
                            packets should be made available to institutional borrowers. Posts
                            should be guided by the number of commercial outlets making U.S.
                            recordings available; although in most countries the price for American
                            recordings is extremely high, those institutions or persons
                            professionally interested in our music will generally buy the
                            record.</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Lectures:</hi> It is S.O.P. to tie in books with
                            lectures at our centers. However, posts should also tie in lecture
                            material with the library reference services as additional
                            documentation. The <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> lecture packets
                            are prepared with policy-application in mind; the lectures are written
                            by top people in the academic or writing fields. Recently, the Director
                            of the Agency asked the Agency’s Area Director to call attention of
                            their <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s to these lectures and to
                            point out that he feels they have multiple-use potential. The lectures
                            also can serve as background material for Embassy speech-makers and for
                            leader contacts.</p>
                        <p>(d) <hi rend="italic">Exhibits:</hi> Generally, there is good space in
                            centers for display of exhibits and every center should program exhibits
                            and/or book promotion displays on a regular, continuing basis.</p>
                        <p>Centers should not limit themselves to consideration of fine arts
                            displays. Exhibits distributed to posts for retention (printed unmounted
                            exhibits commonly called “paper shows”), and the circulating panel shows
                            which usually are hung on a Nelson Structure, should receive priority
                            consideration for display in centers.</p>
                        <p>These “paper shows” and circulating exhibits are concerned with subjects
                            within the framework of the Agency’s and the post’s major <pb n="78" facs="0119" xml:id="pg_78"/>themes, and are pertinent to the
                            viewers’ interest in important and current aspects of America. Displayed
                            in full or in part (depending on available space in the center), the
                            shows often gain effectiveness when placed adjacent to allied library
                            materials for special emphasis.</p>
                        <p>To insure that exhibits received by the post are not lost in the
                            warehouse, or otherwise “shelved,” we feel that American officers
                            charged with supervision of the centers should review each exhibit
                            received. There should be a proper evaluation not only of the aesthetic
                            quality but also of the program value, a consideration that a national
                            employee often is unable to make.</p>
                        <p>The Agency’s exhibit program (other than the East-West Exchange) is small
                            and consists principally of paper shows, in addition to supplying
                            display components to posts for local production. The Agency is
                            canvassing posts for a determination of the value of paper shows. Let us
                            also weigh their effectiveness as a center activity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ACTION:</p>
                        <p>The Agency expects that each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> will

                            program content will be studied continuously for maximum use of books

                        <p>At your instruction I have today reviewed, within the limits of time, the
                            Warren Report.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">On November 29, 1963,
                                President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>
                                established a commission, chaired by then-Chief Justice of the
                                United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, to investigate <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s November 22
                                assassination. The group was subsequently referred to as the Warren
                                Commission and the report was the culmination of that investigation.
                                (John D. Morris, “<persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>

                        <p>My conclusions are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Overseas the report should do something to dilute the conspiracy
                            theory of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s
                            assassination. The vested interests in that theory, combined with
                            overseas experience with political conspiracy, make it, I suspect,
                            impossible to eliminate that view.</p>
                        <p>2. The handling of all aspects of the relations between the Soviet Union,
                            Cuba, and Mexico with Oswald is correct. The report does, however, blow
                            the fact that Oswald<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">See <ref target="#d2fn4">footnote 4, Document 2</ref>.</note> saw a named <gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss> agent at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
                            City; and there is the flat statement on page 423 that: . . . “his
                            commitment to Marxism and communism appears to be another important
                            factor in his motivation.” Depending on Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>’s decision, this statement
                            may get some considerable attention at home; and it may be debated
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>3. The criticisms of the <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss> and the
                            Secret Service, and the more muted criticism of the Department of State,
                            may get some attention abroad, although the major impact will be
                            domestic.</p>
                        <p>4. It may well be that the major task for ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will be to prevent the discussion
                            and debate in the U.S. from projecting an image of excessive domestic
                            disarray.</p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="0121" xml:id="pg_80"/>
                        <p>5. With respect to the domestic scene, a good deal hinges, as I suggest,
                            on Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>’s decision
                            about using this report in the campaign. Specifically, he could seize on
                            these items at least:</p>
                        <p>a. The passage on Oswald’s motivation quoted above from page 423.</p>
                        <p>b. The role of the State Department. It would be easy to bypass the legal
                            basis for the State Department actions in financing Oswald’s return and
                            subsequently giving him a passport, thus exploiting a coarsened version
                            of the story to reflect insensitivity to communism in the State
                            Department. Although the dual failure of the “lookout file” procedure is
                            a bit scandalous, it does not really bear on the tragedy. But critics
                            will use it.</p>
                        <p>c. The extraordinary communication of Oswald with the Soviet Embassy in
                            Mexico City could, evidently, be made the subject of doubt. It took a
                            quite fine-grained analysis by the Commission to sort that one out.</p>
                        <p>d. The criticism of the <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss> and the
                            Secret Service is the most serious of the judgments rendered. Although
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> may not be
                            inclined, in principle, to attack the <gloss target="#t_FBI_1">FBI</gloss>, it is possible that he or the Republican Vice
                            Presidential candidate<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4"><persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> selected Representative
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MPA_1">William E. Miller</persName> (R-New
                                York), Chairman of the Republican National Committee, as his Vice

                            may try to assign responsibility, directly or indirectly, to the then
                            Attorney General.</p>
                        <p>6. The criticisms made of the local authorities in Dallas, notably in
                            their handling of Oswald’s transfer and permitting Ruby’s<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">See <ref target="#d4fn9">footnote 9, Document
                                    4</ref>.</note> access, and the criticisms of the press will be
                            noted abroad; but the shock was largely absorbed in the widespread
                            showing of the films of the critical four-days and the thoughtful
                            observations of the Warren Commission on these matters, may be, on
                            balance, a positive factor.</p>
                        <p>7. On the whole, the Warren Commission report, as <persName corresp="#p_LEK_1">Ernest Lindley</persName> noted, is up to the
                            best Royal Commission standards. For those with open minds, it cannot
                            help be a strengthening, rather than a weakening, factor both at home
                            and on the world scene; although it will reopen in an authoritative way
                            debates which have only thus far been contained because the Warren
                            Commission Report was on its way.</p>
                        <p>8. My most important recommendation is that the White House issue a
                            detailed, consolidated statement of changes in government practice in
                            the relevant fields since the assassination, including responses <pb n="81" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_81"/>to the Warren Commission
                            recommendations. It is essential that this material not dribble out
                            piecemeal, department by department.</p>
                        <p>9. I had a conversation in this vein with the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_AB_1">Burnett
                                Anderson</persName>). I said they should keep closely in touch with
                            Jim <persName corresp="#p_GJL_1">Greenfield</persName> and, on my
                            behalf, <persName corresp="#p_LEK_1">Ernest Lindley</persName> in
                            following up. As the debate unfolds, issues will arise—almost certainly
                            some issues we have not now anticipated. It will be important to
                            maintain the closest possible liaison between the Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, as well as between the Department,
                            Treasury, Justice, and the White House. We must be a united government
                            in this matter.</p>

                        <p>In line with our discussion about the difficulties of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> keeping well enough informed about
                            military exercises and other developments to do its job adequately, I
                            wish to cite two recent cases to illustrate the contention that the
                            State Department also is delinquent in this respect.</p>
                        <p>1. More than two weeks ago the White House asked the State Department for
                            a position, <hi rend="italic">coordinated with other agencies</hi>, on
                            the proposal that the Lockheed Aircraft Company<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">An American aerospace company founded in
                                1912.</note> be permitted to sell the South African Government about
                            $100,000,000 worth of planes for anti-submarine warfare training. I
                            first learned of this potential sale because of a casual remark dropped
                            after one of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>’s
                            staff meetings. I later found that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJC_1">Kitchen</persName>, through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE_2">Thompson</persName> and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName>, had submitted to the Secretary a
                            proposed response to the President. The submission included letters from
                            Treasury, Commerce and Defense, and discussed the views of various areas
                            of State, but no effort had been made either to inform <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> or to find out its views on the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p><pb n="82" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_82"/>I think you will agree that the
                            sale of aircraft to South Africa for possible military use is a matter
                            of the very deepest psychological and propaganda importance,
                            particularly in Africa, and that the views of this agency, charged with
                            responsibility in the propaganda area, ought to be cranked into the
                            decision making process.</p>
                        <p>2. On Saturday, September 26, Rollie <persName corresp="#p_WBM_1">White</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Foreign Service Officer
                                for the Department of State.</note> of State telephoned <persName corresp="#p_AB_1">Burnett Anderson</persName>, my Assistant Deputy
                            Director for Policy and Plans, and secured his clearance on a
                                telegram<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                            relating to the possible explosion of a nuclear device by the Chinese
                            Communists. <persName corresp="#p_AB_1">Anderson</persName> was led to
                            believe that this was a more or less routine telegram related to other
                            telegrams on the subject. Information made available to us today,
                            however, indicates that the telegram was far from routine, and would not
                            have been cleared by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> had all of
                            the background information been made available to us, as it should have
                            been.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you will impress upon your colleagues that a little better
                            coordination can be achieved quite easily, and that we shall all have
                            fewer headaches as a result. For example, a recent memorandum<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">Not further identified.</note> from me to the
                            President relating to the proposed visit of a nuclear task force to
                            certain African countries created some havoc at State and a request from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE_2">Thompson</persName> to me that
                            wherever possible <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> resolve
                            differences of viewpoint directly with State. The trouble here was that
                            State had not kept <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> informed, and
                            thus coordination was impossible.</p>
                        <p>We are aware that the psychological-propaganda factor is only one of many
                            factors that go into determining policy, but we want to insert that
                            factor in as orderly and helpful a way as possible.</p>

                        <p>In line with our recent conversation in which you asked about items which
                            might be announced from or in relation to the White House, I have just
                            completed several major developments at <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> which can be made public with considerable
                            benefit.</p>
                        <p>Two of them are of considerable importance, and I believe that it would
                            be advantageous if I could have a few minutes in which to discuss these
                            developments with you.</p>
                        <p>Following are the points I have in mind:</p>
                        <p>I. Most important is an agreement just concluded by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> and myself under which this
                            Agency’s Career Reserve Officers will become members of the Foreign
                            Service. This is the most important development in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> since it became an independent
                            agency, and it will go far toward raising the calibre of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s personnel and improving the
                            overall efficiency of the Agency. I am forwarding to you here- with a
                            joint memorandum to you from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> and myself along with the pertinent documents,
                            including a Press Statement which the Secretary and I propose that you
                                make.<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">Not found. The conversion of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Career Reserve Officers into
                                Department of State Foreign Service Officers did not occur during
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>’s tenure as <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Director. Congressional
                                legislation authorizing the conversion was not passed until 1968. On
                                August 20 of that year, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> signed into law <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 90–494 (82 <gloss target="#t_Stat_1">Stat.</gloss>

                                act today culminates the determined efforts of three

                        <p>III. Because of a belief that certain <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> publications were not of an influence commensurate
                            with their costs, I recently ordered a thorough study of our
                            publications’ policies by a select committee.<note n="6" xml:id="d30fn6">Not further identified.</note> Yesterday, based on findings of this
                            committee, I ordered the discontinuance of 46 publications which now
                            cost the Government an estimated $700,000 a year. I have approved the
                            committee’s recommendation that we replace these 46 publications with
                            four new publications which will more effectively and economically tell
                            this country’s story abroad.</p>
                        <p>The net result will be a 40 percent reduction in the number of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> publications and a saving of at
                            least $350,000 which we can apply to a critically needed expansion of
                            our program in such areas as the Congo and Eastern Africa.</p>
                        <p>IV. As a further step in sharpening administrative procedures in the
                            Agency, new policies were put into effect this week curtailing sharply
                            the use of overtime. This will produce an estimated saving of between
                            $100,000 and $150,000. The savings here as in Item III are annual.</p>
                        <p>I am aware of the terrible burdens on you during this period, but hope
                            you can find a few minutes in which we may discuss these items.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>With reference to your memorandum of September 28,<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">See <ref target="#d29">Document 29</ref>.</note> I
                            want you to know that I fully agree on the need for better coordination
                            between the Department and the Information Agency. I also share your
                            belief that this should not be too difficult to achieve.</p>
                        <p>We already have a good basis in existing machinery in the form of close
                            and continuous consultations between your <gloss target="#t_IOP_1">IOP</gloss> officers and our officers of regional bureaus, as well
                            as in the daily morning visits to Public Affairs by Jay Gildner.<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Foreign
                                Service Career Reserve Officer.</note> What we still need to do, it
                            seems to me, is to improve the working of this machinery in every way we
                            can. On our part this will involve a greater positive awareness of your
                            need to be informed of problems involving foreign opinion and of our
                            need for your special knowledge and expertise in this field.</p>
                        <p>I am taking several steps within the Department to improve my Bureau’s
                            ability to keep you currently informed about projected military
                            exercises and similar developments of the kind described in your
                            memorandum of September 28.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps a weekly meeting between you, or <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Don
                                Wilson</persName>, and me would prove useful in providing a regular
                            basis on which to keep each other better informed on highly sensitive
                            matters. Before such a meeting I would undertake to inform myself on
                            developments which should be brought to your attention.<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">An unknown hand drew a vertical line in the

                            which may have taken place after Mr. Gildner leaves here at noon. You
                            might wish to have a similar check made around 11:30 or noon on
                                Saturday.<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5"><persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> drew a vertical line in the left-hand margin

                            am not in then, one of my Deputies will be available. If not, the Duty
                            Officer in my office or in the News Office will be available at that
                            time. Such additional liaison, on a regular basis, should help toward
                            solving this problem.</p>
                        <p>The overall problem for both of us is, of course, how to bring your
                            knowledge and ours to bear on a policy decision as close to inception
                            time as possible. I have now discussed this matter thoroughly with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE_2">Thompson</persName> and Howard
                            Meyers of our Political-Military staff and there is total agreement that
                            they too would make a conscious, concerted, and continuing effort to
                            alert <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as promptly as possible on
                            all matters of mutual concern. These alerts will, we are assured, take
                            place as near to the inception of any event as is possible.</p>
                        <p>I will be glad to put into operation as soon as possible any or all of
                            the above suggestions that you consider practicable, and would welcome
                            any suggestions you may care to make which would improve our
                                liaison.<note n="6" xml:id="d31fn6">In a November 24 letter to

                        <p>I arrived in Vietnam on August 22 and remained until September 12, 1964.
                            Since it was necessary for <gloss target="#t_CPAO_1">CPAO</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry Zorthian</persName> to travel to the
                            U.S. during my visit, I returned to Vietnam on September 26, following
                            my trip to Laos, and remained for four days in order to discuss my
                            observations and recommendations with him. I talked with every member of
                            the American staff except <gloss target="#t_BNC_1">BNC</gloss> Grantee
                            John Garrett, who was in Nhatrang. I visited My Tho, Go Cong and Can Tho
                            in the Mekong Delta area, and also travelled to Dalat, Danang, Tam Ky
                            and Hue. I consulted with representatives of the Embassy, <gloss target="#t_CAS_1">CAS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> and the
                            British Embassy, as well as numerous Vietnamese in the Government and in
                            private life. Throughout most of the time I spent in Vietnam, my work
                            was interrupted or impeded by governmental instability which sometimes
                            reached the stage of utter chaos.</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">General:</hi> The almost complete lack of top
                            echelon leadership in the Government of Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>) has made progressively more difficult
                            the conduct of an effective <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            program. The preponderance of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            activity in Vietnam is designed to provide a surrogate information
                            service for the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> or to stiffen
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> information operations. To
                            accomplish this we must work <hi rend="italic">through</hi> the existing
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> information apparatus, an
                            apparatus that has become virtually paralyzed in most provinces because
                            of lack of direction and support from Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Vietnamese peasants are, in the main, going to be persuaded by <hi rend="italic">other Vietnamese</hi>. This is the job of the
                            Vietnamese Information Service (<gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss>).
                            And <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> is not doing its job, except in
                            a few noticeably atypical instances. Indeed, in the areas where <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> employees are needed most, they are
                            least likely to leave the relative security of province or district
                            capitals to work among the peasants.</p>
                        <p><pb n="88" facs="0129" xml:id="pg_88"/>In <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>, and indeed in all other U.S. operations in Vietnam,
                            there are skilled and dedicated Americans literally working themselves
                            to the point of utter exhaustion while most of their Vietnamese
                            counterparts merely go through the motions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The number one problem in Vietnam is motivation</hi>.
                            And at this juncture I am constrained to say that I see little
                            likelihood of instilling in the Vietnamese the motivation which will be
                            required to win the war—under the present rules. I refer here to the
                            civil servants and the population at large; in the armed forces,
                            training and leadership (in combat it is often <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> American leadership) can compensate to some degree for a
                            lack of personal motivation. But the Vietnamese <hi rend="italic">civil</hi> population, family-oriented, selfish and opportunistic
                            even in the best of times, has virtually nothing to lead it or inspire
                            it now.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, we must continue to try. The present American approach
                            should be continued and augmented, i.e., install Americans down to the
                            lowest practical level in all branches of the government to stiffen the
                            inadequately motivated Vietnamese civil as well as military officials.
                            Then, if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> doesn’t work, dust off the
                            contingency plans.</p>
                        <p>We have proved that we can improve the efficiency of centralized Ministry
                            of Information (<gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss>) operations, such
                            as radio broadcasting, printing and motion picture production, by
                            providing American advisors. With our greatly augmented field operations
                            staff we have been able to make some impact upon <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> provincial operations, but have
                            wrought significant improvement only in those unusual cases where a
                            provincial governor and/or provincial <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> chief are disposed to use initiative in the absence of
                            orders from above. But we cannot expect real progress until we have a
                            more stable <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>, good <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss> leadership, and better qualified and
                            motivated personnel in <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Personnel and Post Morale:</hi> We have fielded the
                            “first team” in Vietnam. This is obvious to any qualified observer. It
                            is recognized by all our key colleagues in other agencies.</p>
                        <p>Although we are still woefully weak in Vietnamese language-qualified
                            officers (there are 17 positions listed as “language
                            essential—Vietnamese”, but only three officers qualified in the
                            language), almost all our officers are qualified in French and use it to
                            advantage in their work.</p>
                        <p>The post has lost much of the air of intimate camaraderie which
                            previously characterized it, a virtually inevitable consequence of an
                            almost complete personnel turnover as well as the tremendous increase in
                            the size of the staff. Morale is nevertheless good despite overwork,
                            hardship and danger.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry Zorthian</persName> is aware that he
                            has a potential problem of lowered morale and reduced efficiency in his
                            staff stemming from stress and overwork unrelieved by adequate rest and
                            relaxation. As so often hap<pb n="89" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_89"/>pens
                            in such situations, the employees who need rest the most get the least.
                            However, Barry should perhaps be more aware that he is unique, that all
                            members of his staff are not <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry
                                Zorthians</persName>, capable of functioning at top speed and peak
                            efficiency day and night with little rest and no <hi rend="italic">divertissement</hi>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> The Agency should accelerate its
                            training of officers in the Vietnamese language. We are likely to have a
                            long-range commitment in Vietnam. Furthermore, numerous vacancies will
                            be upcoming next year. A knowledge of French may be sufficient for most
                            of those stationed in Saigon, but only a brief look at the work of
                            Talbott Huey and Frank Scotton quickly convinces one that a knowledge of
                            Vietnamese makes a world of difference in the field.<note n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">Talbott Huey served in Vietnam as a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Officer; Frank Scotton served as
                                a Foreign Service Officer.</note></p>
                        <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Country Plan:</hi> The most recent Country Plan
                            was submitted in February 1963.<note n="3" xml:id="d32fn3">Not
                                found.</note> Based on the program being conducted under the Ngo
                            Dinh Diem regime, much of it is completely outdated. The post is working
                            on a draft of a new plan, which should be finished soon. I read a
                            portion of the draft while in Saigon. It reveals that, though the
                            situation has changed much, the basic problems remain the same. The old
                            plan is not as obsolete as it seems. Psychological objectives in the new
                            plan will probably be little different from those now in use.</p>
                        <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Organizational and Operational Evaluation:</hi> The
                            post was still on a shakedown cruise when I arrived; the <gloss target="#t_CPAO_1">CPAO</gloss> had been at the post six months, his
                                <gloss target="#t_DPAO_1">DPAO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_IO_1">IO</gloss> and at least a
                            dozen others only a few weeks. All key elements of the operation had
                            been recently reorganized.</p>
                        <p>To the observer it appeared that there was too much emphasis on
                            coordinating, planning, organizing and reporting, and not enough
                            concentration on the quality of the media products and the proper
                            dissemination of those products to the Vietnamese end-users. The newness
                            of staff and the internal reorganization are partly responsible, as is
                            the state of continuing chaos in the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>. To these must be added the requirements placed on
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> by an Ambassador who has long
                            been accustomed to calling upon a huge staff for frequent briefings and
                            mountains of studies, charts and reports.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Joint Field Services Center</hi> is developing well
                            as an inter-agency operation. The Field Representatives are an
                            outstanding group and they are well supervised. The Deputy Director of
                            the Center (a <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> officer) seems well
                            utilized; the military personnel seem underemployed and inadequately
                            supervised.</p>
                        <p><pb n="90" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_90"/><persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> has divorced the <hi rend="italic">branch
                                posts</hi> from field operations and has placed them under the
                            supervision of the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>. He insists that
                            this is the only way to prevent cultural activities in the branches from
                            being ignored in favor of field operations. I would not attempt to
                            second-guess him on this internal matter. However, I would point out
                            that the new arrangement causes some jurisdictional confusion both in
                            Saigon and in the field. Moreover, it ties up personnel (<gloss target="#t_BPAO_1">BPAO</gloss>’s and their staffs) and resources in
                            programs of a long-range nature. Granted, there is undeniable value in
                            programs aimed at intellectuals, urban leaders and students, but I
                            believe the war is going to be won or lost out in the hamlets, where the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> are. I suppose it comes down to a
                            matter of relative emphasis, and on this point Barry and I differ.</p>
                        <p>Peter Madison has been designated <hi rend="italic">Special
                                Assistant</hi> to the <gloss target="#t_CPAO_1">CPAO</gloss>. He
                            actually is being utilized as a special projects officer rather than a
                            special assistant. He handles such matters as the third country
                            information program and the development of an overseas information
                            capability in the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs, i.e., matters which fall outside the realm of any
                            specific section of the post. Madison, a talented and versatile officer,
                            does not seem to be adequately utilized.</p>

                            agencies are the best I have ever seen anywhere. <gloss target="#t_CPAO_1">CPAO</gloss>

                            unprecedented power and responsibility in psychological operations in
                            general and press relations in particular. He uses it in such a way that
                            he gets excellent cooperation and never causes resentment. <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> acknowledges his primacy as Chairman
                            of the Psychological Operations Committee and as the press counsellor
                            and spokesman of the entire U.S. Mission. <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> has voluntarily placed its Communications Media
                            Division under his supervision. Thus, although most of the advisory and
                            consultant personnel which the Agency has provided to work with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> report to the Chief of

                            serve as program director. Approximately a dozen military personnel work
                            full time in the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> offices, in the

                            and his staff. Seems unbelievable, but it’s all true!</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> relations with the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> continue to be excellent. That they
                            are not very productive at this time is, of course, not the fault of
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Among the worst problems plaguing <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            are <hi rend="italic">over-centralization of</hi> printing facilities,
                                <hi rend="italic">over-production</hi> by those over-centralized
                            facilities, <pb n="91" facs="0132" xml:id="pg_91"/>and the consequent
                                <hi rend="italic">clogging of distribution channels</hi> with
                            printed materials that are inappropriate and too old to be useful when
                            they reach the reader. An American responsible for distribution in the
                            field would destroy publications which reached him too late to be useful
                            and would report to his headquarters that he had done so and why. A
                            Vietnamese wouldn’t dare. Thus the tardy publications are even further
                            delayed because the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> employee has
                            not yet delivered the last batch he received, but is under orders to
                            distribute everything he gets.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> are responsible for the over-centralized printing;
                            through <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAP_1">MAP</gloss> funding, large printing plants have
                            been built in Saigon for <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> Psywar. The Vietnamese naturally
                            feel that these plants should be used, as indeed they are, to churn out
                            a staggering quantity of leaflets, pamphlets, magazines, army
                            newspapers, etc., most of which are mediocre at best.</p>
                        <p>Both the <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> printing plants are seldom capable
                            of producing leaflets with sufficient speed to meet tactical needs.
                            Therefore, tactical leaflets are usually printed in <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>’s own printing plant. But
                            distribution channels are so burdened with <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> materials
                            that leaflets which should be disseminated within hours, or at most
                            days, after printing are found undistributed in outlying provinces weeks
                            later. For example, I found thousands of leaflets concerning the August
                            4–5 Tonkin Gulf affair undistributed in Can Tho on September 2 and in
                            Quang Tin Province on September 9.</p>
                        <p>I consider <hi rend="italic">distribution the most serious operational
                                problem</hi> in Vietnam—distribution of films as well as
                            publications. In approaching the publications distribution problem,
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> should try to persuade the <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> printing
                            plants in Saigon to produce fewer and better products, concentrating as
                            much as possible on non-transient publications. It should be pointed out
                            to <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss>, for example, that a <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> troop newspaper is of limited utility if
                            dissemination of that weekly in the provinces is six weeks late.
                            Over-centralization of printing in Saigon not only clogs channels with
                            materials unsuited to local needs, but also uses up funds and supplies
                            which could otherwise be used with more effect regionally and
                            locally.</p>
                        <p>The only truly effective way to bring the printing nightmare under
                            control is by implementation of Kenneth Sayre’s<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">Chief of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>

                            disapprove requests and establish priorities. The chances of getting the
                            Vietnamese to agree to this are virtually nil. Thus, the observer is
                            forced to the ineluctable conclusion that we would all be <pb n="92" facs="0133" xml:id="pg_92"/>a lot better off in Vietnam if it were
                            possible to stop all <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss> propaganda printing in Saigon and put
                            an additional mimeograph machine in every district. Instead, while I was
                            in Saigon, <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> brought in a mobile
                            printing plant from Okinawa to increase the <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> Psywar printing capacity!</p>
                        <p>Statistically <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            <hi rend="italic">distribution of films</hi> compares favorably with
                            early 1963. But the statistics reflect repeated showings in the same
                            secure hamlets. This problem can be really solved only by enlargement of
                            areas under effective government control, though some improvement could
                            be effected by persuading certain <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss>
                            personnel that their interpretation of what constitutes security is

                            there is. Circulation of Vietnamese-language dailies is now estimated at

                                housed at <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and composed of

                                (twenty-three of these Vietnamese employees are stationed in
                                provincial offices of the Vietnamese Information Service).” See <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d160"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    1965, Document 160</ref>.</note> Some of these originate in the
                            Center; others are channeled through the Center from <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_MOI_1">MOI</gloss>. The
                            Center is at least one place where printing requests can be more
                            effectively reviewed prior to printing. It appears that the screening is
                            cursory. It is recognized that there are occasions when the Center is
                            reluctant to deny an <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> officer’s
                            request for printing of a leaflet for fear of curbing his all-too-rare
                            initiative. Yet it seems that even quantities are seldom questioned.
                            Furthermore, I could find no evidence that the Center <hi rend="italic">pre-tests</hi> any of its own leaflets. I was disturbed to discover
                            that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> would undertake the printing
                            of a leaflet in hundreds of thousands of copies without pre-testing it.
                            After all, even if a leaflet is destined for airdrop in an inaccessible
                            area, one can at least pre-test it in some village near Saigon that is
                            typically Vietnamese. This has not been done. The result is that <hi rend="italic">post</hi>-testing has shown that some of our leaflets
                            are unclear, too sophisticated, and assume too much knowledge on the
                            part of the rural reader.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the lack of pre-testing of leaflets, the Center’s <hi rend="italic">research</hi> work is thorough and highly valued by
                            all agencies in Saigon and by the Agency. Particularly useful has been
                            the work of the Center’s <hi rend="italic">Survey Teams</hi>. The teams
                            have given us more of an insight into rural attitudes than any other
                            device that has been used. They should be continued and expanded.</p>
                        <p>With reference to my earlier pessimistic comments about motivation, I
                            would like to point to one example of conspicuous success in motivating
                            Vietnamese. Field Representative Frank Scotton has conducted four
                            training courses for Self Defense Corps platoons in Quang <pb n="94" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_94"/>Ngai Province designed to indoctrinate
                            as well as to train the troops in propaganda work. Scotton has inspired
                            these troops. They have done exemplary missionary work in the hamlets
                            and, more important, they have demonstrated the highest kind of valor in
                            combat. The question is: How can such a program be expanded? I urged
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry Zorthian</persName> to require
                            Scotton to produce some sort of syllabus or training manual that can be
                            used elsewhere. Though much of the Quang Ngai success is attributable to
                            the forcefulness of the Scotton personality and his fluency in
                            Vietnamese, I believe a similar job can be done on a larger scale by
                            others. Certainly anything that will motivate should be tried.</p>

                            student and leader grantees are hampered by military conscription and
                            the serious shortage of trained manpower. Recruitment of American
                            professors and teachers for service in Vietnam has been understandably
                            difficult; few academicians relish the idea of serving in a “war zone”.
                            Moreover, those who have been sent to Vietnam have found their work
                            impeded by student demonstrations, closing of schools, etc. Despite all
                            these frustrations, the post has managed to conduct a surprisingly good,
                            though modest, exchange program. <pb n="95" facs="0136" xml:id="pg_95"/><persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MKE_1">Mundt</persName> professors and teachers have

                            hardship.</p>
                        <p>Though the post has plans for a more organized and structured approach to
                            contacts with returned grantees, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>

                            little has been accomplished to date. Now that the cultural staff has
                            finally been brought up to strength again, this activity should be given
                            a higher priority than it has heretofore enjoyed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Bi-National Center</hi> operations are expanding at an
                            almost astonishing rate. English teaching activity is growing in Hue,
                            Dalat, Danang, Nhatrang and Can Tho. A branch of the Saigon
                            Vietnamese-American Association has just been opened in Saigon’s Chinese
                            “twin city” of Cholon. For the foreseeable future, only the Saigon and
                            Cholon operations can be expected to conduct more than token programs of
                            general activities in addition to English teaching; the other operations
                            do not have adequate staffs for it. The Saigon <gloss target="#t_BNC_1">BNC</gloss> stages frequent lectures, exhibits, musical programs
                            and social events—an excellent activities program, which unfortunately
                            has not been emulated by the post’s <hi rend="italic">Information

                            than a library. In meetings which I attended he decried the
                            unimaginative presentation of public and untargeted film showings and
                            called for plans for an expanded program for specific target audiences.

                        <p>Under the conditions prevailing in Vietnam for the past year, effective

                            impossible. The post’s contacts with youth and student leaders have
                            nevertheless improved during this period, enabling <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers to exert occasional
                            moderating influence. Improved contacts have also produced the
                            by-product of useful political reporting for the Mission. <gloss target="#t_BPAO_1">BPAO</gloss>’s have greatly augmented contacts
                            with secondary schools in their areas. I found universal awareness of
                            the importance of youth activities. In fact, the post was already
                            planning a specialized youth publication before <gloss target="#t_RSC_1">RSC</gloss> proposed its new <hi rend="italic">Quest</hi> magazine,

                        <p>No problems or complaints were encountered regarding <hi rend="italic">Agency support</hi>. On the contrary, I heard many expressions of
                            appreciation for the Agency’s unqualified support in personnel, funds,
                            equipment and supplies. Especially appreciated was the outstanding
                            performance of <gloss target="#t_IOC_2">IOC</gloss> in obtaining
                            donations from private American business firms of commodities which

                            separately. The size of the foreign press corps (at one time during my
                            visit there were more than a hundred American and other foreign
                            journalists in the country) and the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s inability effectively to handle the press place an
                            enormous burden upon the U.S. Mission. As stated earlier no problems
                            exist within the Mission; cooperation is excellent among all American
                            agencies and <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry Zorthian</persName>’s
                            primacy in press relations is acknowledged. However, the magnitude of
                            press relations and the serious and sensitive implications for U.S.
                            foreign policy in each day’s developments demand that <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> spend an inordinate amount of
                            time keeping abreast of events, discussing and helping to formulate the
                            public positions which the U.S. will adopt regarding those events, and
                            meeting with the press. At present, <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> is not making sufficient use of his Press
                            Attache and Assistant Press Attache. It is simply impossible for him to
                            do so. He has no time to supervise or direct them. Both are needed; the
                            Press Attache to handle individual press briefings, arrange press
                            conferences and in-country trips, etc.; and the Assistant to concentrate
                            on special visitors and third country journalists.</p>
                        <p>Several times I asked <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> if
                            he thought he could continue to serve as both chief press counsellor and
                                <gloss target="#t_CPAO_1">CPAO</gloss> without detriment to one or
                            both functions. On each occasion he replied that it was too early to
                            tell, that the number of correspondents in Vietnam might begin to taper
                            off, and that the preoccupation with U.S. domestic opinion might
                            decrease following our elections on November 3.<note n="10" xml:id="d32fn10">The date of the 1964 Presidential election.</note>
                            Yet he conceded that it might become necessary for him to revive his
                            earlier request for a second <gloss target="#t_DPAO_1">DPAO</gloss> to
                            handle the press. As you know, he has now done so, with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD_1">Taylor</persName>’s support.</p>
                        <p>I feel that Barry must have the additional help. It may seem unusual to
                            establish the unprecedented position of a second <gloss target="#t_DPAO_1">DPAO</gloss>. But I would invite your attention
                            to the fact that the President has found it necessary to appoint a
                            Deputy Ambassador, also unprecedented. The problem is unique; the
                            solution must be also.</p>
                        <p>A second <gloss target="#t_DPAO_1">DPAO</gloss> could relieve <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> of a tremendous load. Even a
                            human dynamo such as Barry cannot indefinitely carry the duties and
                            responsibilities which burden him now.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> The Agency should designate as

                        <p>In view of the widespread African hostility to the Stanleyville rescue
                            mission, I thought you might be interested in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s efforts to generate understanding and sympathy for
                            the operation.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> policy from the start was to rely
                            heavily on rebel brutality as a means of influencing world opinion in
                            support of the humanitarian aspects of the rescue mission. Before the
                            paratroop drop, the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> mission in
                            Leopoldville had instructions on the press, motion picture, still
                            picture, and radio coverage required to document this brutality. At the
                            time of the drop, the Agency instructed its posts throughout the world
                            to establish the essential facts and to “play up evidence of rebel
                            atrocities, callous disregard for lives of Congolese and other
                            noncombatants, defiance of worldwide condemnation.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Radio:</hi> From November 24 to December 11, the Voice

                            operation and rebel brutality. Additionally, there were more than a
                            dozen commentaries on all major language services. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> correspondents flew to the Congo for

                        <p>(1) Do these libraries serve the U.S. national interest to such a degree
                            as to justify extraordinary efforts on our part to maintain them in
                            countries where efforts are being made to pressure them out?</p>
                        <p>(2) At what point does national pride require us to withdraw voluntarily
                            rather than accept further abuses and affronts?</p>
                        <p>In my view, the answer to the first question is an unequivocal “yes.”

                        <p>We avoid saying this publicly, but many of the attacks on <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries arise clearly from
                            Communist and left-wing beliefs that the libraries are a force running
                            counter to their objectives. Nowhere is this stated more blatantly than
                            in a recent editorial in the <hi rend="italic">Ghanaian Times</hi>
                            (reported in Accra’s 474—tab A).<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">A copy of

                            political motivation of the <gloss target="#t_PKI_1">PKI</gloss> and the
                            youth groups, though they are less direct in saying that they dislike
                            the political impact our libraries have on those who frequent them.</p>
                        <p>I feel that in countries like Ghana, the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, and Indonesia, we must spare no effort to influence
                            students and other youth groups. We must gamble on the long haul—even as
                            we gambled in Stalin’s time that by persistently telling our story
                            bit-by-bit we would eventually cause some stirrings in Eastern Europe
                            and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I feel strongly that we must not become so piqued or angered by a
                            Sukarno, <persName corresp="#p_NGA_1">Nasser</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_NK_1">Nkrumah</persName> that we voluntarily withdraw
                            our informational and propaganda programs, leaving the Communists to win
                            the youth groups by default.</p>
                        <p>I am for being hard-nosed; for making it clear that we regard these
                            attacks on U.S. mission property as unfriendly acts, and for taking <pb n="101" facs="0142" xml:id="pg_101"/>stiff diplomatic retaliatory
                            acts—but for withdrawing the libraries only when forced out, or when the
                            situation becomes intolerable.</p>
                        <p>This raises anew the second question: When must we regard the situation
                            as intolerable? It is not an easy point to specify in theory; but I do
                            not believe that we have reached it. Both the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> and Indonesian governments have expressed regrets, of a

                            is built. I think that we ought to accept the offer and, through the
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and other means, try to make
                            sure that the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss> people know that the
                            offer of a building has followed an apology—and that we expect further
                            compensation.</p>
                        <p>I feel that we should not reject out-of-hand even an apology that does
                            not seem as enthusiastic as we believe we deserve. While evidences of
                            governmental complicity were obvious in the recent burnings, I emphasize
                            that in some instances governments may be less to blame than we think.
                            The fact is that demonstrations at our libraries have become a fad—there
                            have been as many in Latin America (9) this year as in Africa (1), the
                            Middle East (2), and Asia (6) combined. When the demonstrators claim to
                            be protesting “imperialism” or “racism,” I am sure that African and
                            Asian leaders find it as difficult, politically, to oppose them publicly
                            as it would be for a Negro congressman publicly to oppose a civil rights
                            demonstration. This does not make the attacks on our libraries any more
                            palatable, but it is a factor we ought to weigh in considering the
                            acceptance of proffered apologies.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I believe that our long-term national interest requires us to
                            stand firm and to pressure these governments mightily as we seek to
                            maintain the vital channels through which we contact and influence the
                            future leaders of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In Indonesia it will
                            surely involve some waste of money and personnel while the “battle of
                            nerves” goes on, but if we can hold on it will be money well spent in
                            the larger view of our objectives in Indonesia and Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>Two weeks ago I mentioned to the President that the Russians and Chinese

                            having reached the point where even news about the U.S. is relayed to

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>, within the
                                context of the memorandum, commented that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would “welcome a look at the situation by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Stanton</persName>: “We believe that
                                the program we have developed in the last year is quite
                                impressive—still, we welcome any fresh ideas as to how we might
                                better do the job.” (Ibid., <ref target="frus1964-68v02#d160">Document 160</ref>)</note> This included conversations with top
                            American and Vietnamese officials, and with the ten <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers and several of the Army
                            officers who are working in the provinces. I concluded that:</p>
                        <p>1. The program designed to commit the Vietnamese people to greater
                            support of their government and of the war against communist aggression
                            is vastly better than ten months ago. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> has proved its ability to help the Vietnamese
                            Government meet the insurgency problem through joint development of many
                            techniques (rumor teams, cultural teams, tactical leaflets, loud speaker
                            appeals, film showings, political seminars, etc.) that have met with
                            success in several local areas.</p>
                        <p><pb n="104" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_104"/>2. Nevertheless, this program is
                            still far below what is required to do the job, and is considerably
                            inferior to what <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and this country
                            are capable of providing.</p>
                        <p>3. The long period of government instability and the failure to provide
                            basic physical security to the people in the hamlets and villages are
                            overriding handicaps, but these factors must not be accepted as excuses
                            for our failure to mount a psychological <hi rend="italic">effort</hi>
                            commensurate with the challenge we face.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">MAJOR U.S. SHORTCOMINGS</p>
                        <p>There are two fundamental problems on the American side. First, while
                            various mechanisms have been created for inter-agency “coordination,”
                                <hi rend="italic">what is lacking is unified control and
                                direction</hi> of psychological operations. As you will see later, I
                            have taken steps to erase this, and believe that I have won
                            government-wide acceptance of the several recommendations that will give
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> both the responsibility and
                            authority with which to do the job. Fundamental to all else is a
                            declaration that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has primacy in
                            this field. With the proper mandate, we will do the job.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Second, our psychological program is still penny
                                ante</hi> in comparison with our expenditures in other fields. The
                            yearly cost of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s operation in
                            Viet Nam barely exceeds the cost of one day’s operations in the military
                            and economic fields—this despite the fact that I have virtually doubled
                            our program in the last ten months. So, whereas the money invested in
                            the effort to win over the Vietnamese people was appallingly small a
                            year ago, it can be described even today as glaringly inadequate.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that we alter this situation both by having <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> “borrow” resources from wealthier
                            agencies and departments, and by having the Agency seek a supplemental
                            appropriation for South Viet Nam. I request your authorization for
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to seek through the Bureau of
                            the Budget additional funds and American positions as needed for fiscal
                            1966. We will need at least 60 additional Vietnamese positions, but I
                            will take these out of other country allotments.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">PROBLEM OF COORDINATION WITH SOUTH VIET NAM</p>
                        <p>Even when appropriate steps are taken to increase and improve these
                            programs on the American side, we shall still face the crucial problem
                            of provoking proper action on the part of the Vietnamese Government. If
                            the Vietnamese people are to be won over (and I am convinced we have no
                            chance whatsoever of winning this war unless more and more are won
                            over), we must press the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> to move
                            skillfully and resolutely to meet the problems of apathy, indecision,
                            talent shortage and so forth that have caused the psychological program
                            to remain inadequate.</p>
                        <p><pb n="105" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_105"/>While in Saigon I spent an hour
                            and a half with Prime Minister Quat, with the Minister of Psychological
                            Warfare, General Vien, and with Quat’s principal aide, <persName corresp="#p_BD_1">Bui</persName> Diem. I presented to them a
                            12-point program (TAB A) that would ensure more effective <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            action in the psychological field.</p>
                        <p>I am encouraged by the intellectual fervor that Dr. Quat brings to a
                            discussion of how to improve this program, as well as by the
                            Cabinet-level actions in this direction taken even before I left Saigon.
                            The question remains, however, as to how secure Quat’s position is and
                            to what extent his government’s talk will be translated into action.</p>
                        <p>Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_TMD_1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> warned me that there is a
                            limit to what we can expect the Vietnamese to accomplish. They say that
                            we can smother the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> by loading too
                            much on it. I believe, however, that the situation is so urgent that we
                            must demand vastly more of the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>, in
                            terms of this program, than we have in the past. We must push it to its
                            utmost.</p>
                        <p>I emphasize, however, that the program will not succeed on either the
                            American or <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> side unless and until
                            there is greater recognition throughout both governments of the
                            importance of the psychological aspect of this struggle. On the American
                            side, these programs to affect what the Vietnamese people <hi rend="italic">think</hi> must be given the same status, the same
                            concern, the same adequacy of working resources, as our military and
                            economic operations. I hope that my discussions here and in Viet Nam,
                            and your approval of the actions that I shall recommend, will achieve
                            this.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">PROPOSED ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
                        <p>1. I propose to reorganize drastically <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s mission in Saigon so as to permit a substantial
                            expansion, and more senior-level direction, of the program to inform and
                            influence Vietnamese in the countryside, lift their morale, erase apathy
                            and move them to a commitment to preserve their freedom. This would
                            involve the prompt addition to our staff of 36 Americans, bringing the
                            total to 114, and of 60 Vietnamese, bringing the staff total to 325.

                                an undated organization chart.</note></p>
                        <p>I plan also to reorganize our procedures in Washington for backing up the
                            staff in Viet Nam. Instead of a desk officer, I shall create a small
                            working group that will devote itself exclusively to seeing that the
                            Saigon operation has the proper direction, personnel, program materials,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>2. I recommend that, just as we did in the Honolulu meeting some months
                            ago regarding the handling of the press, State, Defense, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>

                                <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry Zorthian</persName> has overall
                            responsibility and authority for the coordination and direction of the
                            entire psychological warfare program in South Viet Nam.<note n="4" xml:id="d37fn4">The meeting took place on June 2, 1964, in Honolulu,

                                Washington. Moreover, there is agreement on the names of the men to
                                do this job: [Barry] <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName>

                                which I shall discuss later. I have discussed a more co-ordinated
                                arrangement with General <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_PGWR_1">Peers</persName> and others. We have agreed on a plan which
                                does not go as far as I wish, but which may be workable. General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PGWR_1">Peers</persName> agrees with me
                                that if it turns out to be inadequate, we must move promptly to
                                place the psywar officers under direct control of the Center.</p>
                            <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would not assume operational
                                jurisdiction over the psywar officers serving with combat units.
                                These officers will, however, receive general direction from the
                                Mission PysOps Committee, chaired by <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName>, and guidance from the Field Services
                                Center.</p>

                                provides some $600,000 a year to the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s Ministry of Psychological Warfare, should be
                                brought under the direction and control of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Only through control of this program, which
                                provides such things as cameras, mimeograph machines, paper, radios
                                and other information materials, will <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> have the necessary leverage to force the Ministry
                                to undertake the programs necessary to cause the people to respect
                                and support their government.</p>
                            <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s Assistant Director for the Far
                                East, Rutherford Poats, agrees with me on this point. He and my

                                to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p></quote>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s expenditures and its
                            personnel commitments to Viet Nam must be sharply increased. We now have
                            10 men doing an admirable job in the provinces, some of them operating
                            under conditions of considerable danger. I propose to place 15 more
                            officers out in the field, <pb n="107" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_107"/>meaning that a single officer will then have only an average of two
                            provinces to cover.</p>
                        <p>Some of our additional personnel needs can be met by absorption of the
                            staffs from present <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> psychological programs, and
                            hopefully by borrowing other personnel from the military and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is vital that the people we send into the field be young, vigorous and
                            skilled in the techniques of political motivation. Some ability to speak
                            Vietnamese is also required. I have already begun an effort to locate
                            the right kind of personnel within government. I believe, however, that
                            we must also carry the search outside government, and will want to have
                            a look at some former Peace Corps volunteers who may be just the kind of
                            individuals we want.</p>
                        <p>4. Perhaps the most urgent financial requirement is a guarantee that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will have, on a continuing
                            basis, the contingency piaster fund that is indispensable to the
                            psychological operations in the provinces. As you are aware, several
                            months ago <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> made $200,000 (the
                            piaster equivalent) available in order that we might halt a situation
                            where psychological operations were at a stand-still in many provinces
                            because the Vietnamese Information Service had no ready cash for ink,
                            paper or the repairs of mimeograph machines, projectors and the sort.
                            The military psywar experts, who get no direct funds from the military,
                            told me that without this <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            contingency fund they would have virtually no psywar program. The
                            importance of this fund is illustrated by what was achieved in Tan Ba
                            Village by the expenditure of $279 combined with some vigorous and
                            shrewd work by our people (see report at TAB B).<note n="8" xml:id="d37fn8">Attached but not printed is <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Field Message No. 31 from <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Saigon, January 28. According to
                                this message, “A little over three months ago Tan Ba village
                                (population approximately 2,000) was one of the 17 out of 21
                                villages in Phuoc Thanh province which belonged to the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>. Few if any Vietnamese in Tan Ba or
                                in the province believed in the ability of the government or local
                                authorities to provide security or assistance to this poor farming
                                community.” The message further states: “Today all of Tan Ba’s
                                population, together with the majority of people in the contiguous
                                    <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> communities, are aware of the
                                successful government pacification program which is underway.” It
                                concludes: “The Trust Fund allotted to the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Field Representatives played an important role in
                                this project.”</note></p>
                        <p>Both <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> field representatives said they have been “nursing”
                            the $200,000 and declining to initiate programs involving continuing
                            costs, because of doubts that a new allocation would be forthcoming. I
                            have assured them that new funds will be forthcoming, and I now
                            recommend that arrangements be made through <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> or elsewhere to allocate to these field workers a
                            minimum of $75,000 per quarter.</p>
                        <p><pb n="108" facs="0149" xml:id="pg_108"/>5. I recommend that the military
                            make available 20 fixed-wing aircraft (U–10s) or helicopters with loud
                            speakers, these to be available for psywar use four days and nights a
                            week. These aircraft should be divorced from regular flights or combat
                            units, otherwise military operational priorities will too frequently
                            deprive the psychological operations of their use. These loud speaker
                            flights were described to me as one of the most important and best-used
                            media in this war. Many province chiefs say that the sustained use of
                            such aircraft, with messages locally prepared for specific villages or
                            Viet Cong units, are the most effective form of psychological warfare.
                            In the Fourth Corps, I found evidence that a rise in the number of Viet
                            Cong defectors was clearly and directly related to the occurrence of
                            these loud speaker missions.</p>
                        <p>The number one complaint of the military psywar experts as well as the
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> field representatives is that
                            aircraft are available for such flights far too rarely. These loud
                            speaker planes have been most effective in using letters from relatives,
                            or the taped voices of wives and parents appealing to young men to leave
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> and return to their homes. It is
                            recalled that during the Korean war the communists sought vigorously to
                            overrun command posts so as to get troop lists and thus be able to make
                            propaganda appeals to individual Korean soldiers.</p>
                        <p>6. Steps must be taken to give <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> the
                            necessary leverage to induce the province chiefs to include in their
                            economic and military activities the psychological punch that will lift
                            the morale and win the support of the people. At present, these province
                            chiefs listen to advice of the military sector advisors and <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> representatives because each must
                            “sign off” before the pigs are delivered to a village, or the funds are
                            approved for any other project desired by the province chief. Our field
                            representatives working to enhance the people’s view of, and respect
                            for, the government are ignored because they have no voice in the
                            decision as to whether the province chief gets what he wants. I have
                            proposed that the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> representative
                            in the province be added as a “sign off” official, or that through some
                            other means he be given the leverage he needs. I have taken this up with
                            top <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> officials in Washington, and it
                            is to be discussed in the Mission Council<note n="9" xml:id="d37fn9">For

                        <p>7. I recommend that steps be taken to increase radio broadcasting both in
                            South Viet Nam and to North Viet Nam. 20 of some 25 small transmitters
                            taken into Viet Nam by <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss>’s <gloss target="#t_ComMedia_1">ComMedia</gloss> are presently not being used
                            because of the lack of trained <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            personnel to operate <pb n="109" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_109"/>them. We
                            must make a concerted effort to get these stations on the air. A
                            comprehensive radio survey has just been completed by a joint <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            committee, and I am urging that it be adopted and quickly put into
                            effect. It is my understanding that this committee has not recommended a
                            powerful new transmitter for broadcasting in South Viet Nam. However,
                            both Prime Minister Quat and General Vien spoke to me of their eagerness
                            to have such a transmitter. If this can be the sweetener needed to pull
                            the government into the kind of imaginative, vigorous program needed, I
                            recommend that we provide it.</p>
                        <p>8. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TMD_1">Taylor</persName> urges also
                            that we go ahead with the establishment of television in South Viet Nam.
                            There are some substantial drawbacks to doing this, the major one being
                            the fact that inadequate personnel exists to operate the radio stations,
                            and the shortage would be even more acute were television introduced.
                            Nevertheless, because of the great psychological impact of television,
                            and because its introduction would be a dramatic way of saying that the
                            United States intends to stay, I believe that we ought to move speedily
                            to introduce television.</p>
                        <p>I feel strongly that our go-ahead on television should be contingent upon
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> adopting and following through
                            promptly on the radio report.</p>
                        <p>9. There must be an immediate joint <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> program to train
                            more Vietnamese in the techniques of radio and television, and in the
                            general art of information and propaganda. I have told Dr. Quat that the
                            entire facilities of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are
                            available for such training, and that I am willing to send personnel to
                            Saigon to train people there. The need is so great, however, that we
                            need third-country help. This seems to me an area where third-countries
                            can easily make a significant contribution, and I urge that through both
                            State Department and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> channels we
                            solicit such assistance.</p>
                        <p>10. Receipt of this and other third-country help is to a degree dependent
                            on the skill with which the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> tells
                            its story to the world. Both Prime Minister Quat and I hammered on the
                            need for an overseas information program on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>. I expect it will boil down to the
                            question of whether the U.S. can give the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> some financial support for this program. I recommend
                            that we do so, if necessary. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will
                            help to some extent by using its wireless file and other channels for
                            the distribution of some <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> propaganda
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>11. I recommend that steps be taken to remove the “<gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss>”<note n="10" xml:id="d37fn10">The English translation of this Vietnamese term is
                                roughly “open arms” or “call to return.” For an explanation of this

                            defectors and turn them into loyal citizens is largely ineffective
                            because neither we nor the Vietnamese are devoting adequate personnel or
                            resources to it. Vietnamese sources indicate 17,519 communists have
                            “rallied to the national cause.” Interviews with Viet Cong who have
                            recently defected indicate that poverty, disillusionment and increased
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> air strikes are tempting <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> soldiers and cadres to defect in larger numbers than
                            before. In spite of an increased number of returnees, <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> rehabilitation centers are
                            presently without even the most elementary psychological indoctrination
                            programs. Viet Cong returnees generally languish two or three months in
                            “detention” with few daily activities beyond interrogation and
                            occasional lectures on the “good national cause.”</p>
                        <p>A recent visit by a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officer to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> center in Bien Hoa
                            province revealed the following facts: 1) Over 750 returnees had been
                            processed through the camp in 1964, among whom were <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> commissars, political propaganda cadre,
                            and a large number of soldiers. 2) No Vietnamese or American official
                            had visited the center in recent months. 3) Through discussions with the
                            returnees it became evident that their propaganda indoctrination by the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> still remained unanswered and
                            unchallenged.</p>
                        <p>The result is that some Viet Cong defectors have become disillusioned
                            anew, returned to the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> fold, and are
                            now warning their colleagues not to fall for the promises of the
                            government’s <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss>
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TMD_1">Taylor</persName> expressed the
                            view that this program probably belongs under the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> umbrella. I think it does—but is so
                            woefully inadequate at present that I shudder at the thought of taking
                            responsibility for it. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will do
                            so, however, if we can get some assurance of reasonable funds, personnel
                            and facilities with which to run it. This would include the building of
                            centers and the kind of program I saw the British using on the Mau Maus
                            in 1956.<note n="11" xml:id="d37fn11">Reference is to an African

                        <p>This program is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> important, and if it is to
                            succeed there must be major American involvement for the simple reason
                            that many <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> officials involved seem
                            more interested in killing <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> than in
                            rehabilitating them. One of our problems in the villages, I fear, is
                            that some of the extra zealous activities designed to kill <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> have wound up infuriating and
                            disillusioning so many non-communist people that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> actions have
                            created more <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> members and sympathizers
                            than they have killed.</p>
                        <p><pb n="111" facs="0152" xml:id="pg_111"/>12. I recommend that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and the Pentagon, jointly or
                            separately, launch immediately a vigorous program to produce a corps of
                            experts in psychological warfare. Lt. Colonel <persName corresp="#p_MTE_1">Morgan</persName>, the Psychological
                            Operations/Civil Affairs Advisor to the 9th Division, characterized the
                            present situation accurately when he told me: “Our biggest problem in
                            Viet Nam is that we are trying to do a psywar job with a bunch of
                            amateurs, both American and Vietnamese.”</p>
                        <p>I think it is beyond dispute that this country’s greatest reservoir of
                            trained psywar manpower is in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,
                            but I am quick to concede that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            has only a fraction of what we need or are likely to need in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that in earlier years <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            never planned, staffed, organized or budgeted for psywar operations;
                            until recently it was not assumed that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would be called upon to step in and serve as a
                            surrogate information service for a fledgling nation that has neither
                            the professional skill nor the inclination to explain its programs,
                            actions and policies to its own people.</p>
                        <p>Not only do we need a larger pool of talent for Viet Nam, but it is also
                            vital to the protection of our national interest in the Congo,
                            Venezuela, and almost certainly in the near future in many other places,
                            possibly including the Philippines. Most military <gloss target="#t_S5_1">S–5</gloss> advisors and some <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers have been school trained in
                            methods used during World War II involving the relatively sophisticated
                            use of mass media aimed at literate populations with clearly established
                            ethnic and national unity. Our target in Southeast Asia is different in
                            virtually every respect, and we must develop training and techniques to
                            meet the circumstances that prevail.</p>
                        <p>This has been discussed with General <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> and some civilian officials in the Pentagon, one
                            of whom has said that a major reorganization is planned in
                            counter-insurgency training at Fort Bragg and that this reorganization
                            may open the way for implementation of this proposal. I shall pursue
                            this idea.</p>
                        <p>13. We need to exploit to greater advantage <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> prisoners, defectors, captured terrorists. I have been
                            assured of the necessary cooperation of <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> intelligence officers, and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are moving
                            jointly to secure the necessary <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            cooperation. Also, as a result of this mission, I have made arrangements
                            for much closer high-level liaison between <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and Pentagon officials involved in psychological
                            warfare.</p>
                        <p>14. There would be considerable psychological advantage if we proceeded
                            immediately with our plans to build a new embassy in Saigon. Not only is
                            the present ugly and inefficient structure no credit to the United
                            States, but the beginning of a new embassy would be an <pb n="112" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_112"/>additional strong indicator of our
                            intention to stay there and to keep our commitment to the Vietnamese
                            people.</p>
                        <p>15. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> will increase its work in
                            urban areas among youth, labor and religious leaders and the
                            intellectual community. This is essential because there can be no
                            government stability unless these groups are included, or their views
                            and opinions considered, to their satisfaction. I shall have a separate
                            memorandum for you on what I think is the vital need for our top people
                            to establish a warmer, closer relationship with leading Vietnamese, both
                            military and civilian.</p>
                        <p>16. I have talked so far in terms of the need for greater authority,
                            better coordination and more personnel. Effective execution of this
                            program will also require a substantial increase in hardware—more paper
                            and ink for provincial newspapers and leaflets, several trilambrettas to
                            give psywar cadre mobility, perhaps 1,000 new projectors and a suitable
                            collection of films for each province, batteries and generators for
                            radio equipment and projectors, mimeographing machines, and so forth. We
                            shall provide all we can from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            resources, but will certainly have to call on other agencies and
                            departments for assistance.</p>
                        <p>I emphasize, in conclusion, that we take these steps fully aware that
                            many vital factors will still remain beyond our control. But given a
                            reasonable degree of governmental stability in Saigon and physical
                            security in the countryside, I am convinced that this program will have
                            significant impact. Our first hope is that it will prompt <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> officials to act out of certain
                            knowledge that they hold the final key to producing a sense of unity and
                            loyalty among the Vietnamese people.<note n="12" xml:id="d37fn12"><persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Bundy</persName> sent <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> a copy of <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>’s March 16 memorandum under

                            <p>Following for the consideration of the Prime Minister are major

                                Government suggests are of mutual interest and of critical
                                importance. Insofar as the Prime Minister would desire their
                                implementation, the U.S. Government stands prepared to provide such
                                assistance as the Government of Vietnam deems appropriate:</p>

                                public statements in Vietnam of other ministries. The <gloss target="#t_PsyWar_1">PsyWar</gloss> Ministry would coordinate
                                with <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> and would provide full

                                for psychological objectives. The Quat Government should emerge

                        <p>I wish to comment separately on a couple of my observations in South Viet
                                Nam<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">See <ref target="#d37">Document
                                    37</ref>.</note> that seem to me to go to the heart of our
                            future contributions to that country’s efforts to maintain its freedom.
                            I believe it within my purview to comment on these things, because they
                            are psychological factors in the most vital sense of the word.</p>
                        <p>The first observation is that top U.S. officers in Viet Nam must make a
                            conscious and concerted effort to develop relationships of warmth, trust
                            and easy collaboration with opposite numbers on the Vietnamese side. At
                            lower levels, out in the provinces, Americans and Vietnamese have
                            established a marked degree of camaraderie; they eat, work, fight, get
                            ambushed together. But at the higher, decision-making levels there is
                            for the most part only stiff formality. There is too much conference
                            table negotiation between American and Vietnamese and not enough coming
                            together in informal mutual trust to work on a mutual problem.</p>
                        <p>I want to make it clear that my first finger is pointed at my own
                            operation in Viet Nam. <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName>
                            mentioned to me that several <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            officers “have never asked a Vietnamese in for dinner.” I have made it
                            clear that under these circumstances we will never get <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> officials and the Vietnamese people to
                            take the steps needed to beat off Communist aggression, and that I
                            expect more of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers than
                            this.</p>
                        <p>I observed that on the military side not only is there a scarcity of warm
                            relationships at policy-making levels, but there is considerable <pb n="116" facs="0157" xml:id="pg_116"/>fear expressed among
                                Americans<note n="3" xml:id="d38fn3">An unknown hand underlined
                                “fear expressed among Americans.”</note> that we are making mistakes
                            that are certain to worsen the situation.</p>
                        <p>I refer, for example, to the fact that we have set up separate officers
                            and non-commissioned officers’ clubs for Americans—clubs that are quite
                            plush compared with those frequented by the Vietnamese. In Da Nang,
                            General Thi has declared certain bars off limits to Vietnamese soldiers
                            so as to prevent fights between Americans and Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of our refuting the persistent <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> clamor that “the Americans are
                            imperialists,” these developments are not good. I talked to Vietnamese
                            who expressed fear that we are building divisive factors that the enemy
                            can exploit in a devastating way. It becomes a point to consider
                            seriously as we expand the American military presence.</p>
                        <p>Further, I think it is a serious psychological mistake for top Americans
                            (military or civilian) to go to Saigon and proceed directly to a
                            briefing session attended and presided over by American military men
                            only. I feel, and I know some key <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            officials feel, that we blunder by creating the impression that
                            Americans come out to sit down with Americans and plan the next steps in
                            the war. It would be a fine stroke of public relations if we asked top
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> military people to join in the
                            first briefing session—indeed to give their assessment of how the war is
                            going in various areas. We Americans could then hold whatever private
                            sessions we deem necessary—without creating the impression that we meet,
                            make the decisions and then drag the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> along.</p>
                        <p>Several top Americans in Saigon conceded that a desirable high level of
                            rapport with top Vietnamese is lacking. <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Alex Johnson</persName> attributes this to the fact that, in his
                            view, the Vietnamese are not as warm, friendly, outgoing as he found the
                            Thais to be. This may be, but there are just enough cases in Saigon
                            where genuinely warm relationships have been formed to make me believe
                            that much more is possible. I believe it is incumbent upon us Americans,
                            as the rich, powerful advisers, to make the first vigorous efforts to
                            warm up the situation.</p>
                        <p>I recommend we start by <hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> the Vietnamese
                            military to use regularly the American officer and non-com clubs; by
                            encouraging American officers to visit the Vietnamese clubs (many top
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> officers were trained in the
                            United States); by having the Vietnamese military in frequent planning
                            discussions and <hi rend="italic">ensuring that the public knows</hi> of
                            the joint participation, and finally by having Americans orient their
                            entertainment programs toward building more Vietnamese friendships.</p>
                        <p><pb n="117" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_117"/>Finally, I urge that we take
                            much more seriously <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> sensitivities
                            about our announcing actions<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">An unknown hand

                                above, and wrote two question marks.</note> here that catch <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> leaders in Saigon off guard.</p>
                        <p>When we announced abruptly the dispatch of 3,500 Marines to Da Nang we
                            caused Prime Minister Quat to lose face among the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> military. A Vietnamese who is close to
                            the Prime Minister said to me: “We were in a mess, scrambling to inform
                            our top people, to call a cabinet meeting, when the announcement already
                            was on the radio. It made Dr. Quat look like a fool. This sort of thing
                            gives his enemies an excuse to plot against him. It also gave the Viet
                            Cong evidence with which to try to prove that we are lackeys.”</p>
                        <p>My conclusion, of course, is that it is of great political and
                            psychological importance that we coordinate closely with Saigon, and
                            that we not announce here what would be much better announced either by
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>—or jointly.</p>
                        <p>I have made no other distribution of this memorandum so as to leave you
                            free to judge whether these points have merit. If so, a suggestion
                            originating with you will produce more effort in the areas mentioned. If
                            on the other hand you see little more that can be done in this area,
                            this airing of my views will not have caused any interagency
                            irritations.</p>
                        <p>Should you desire, of course, I am quite prepared to discuss these issues
                            frankly with other key officials in Washington.</p>

                            Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the best documentary short produced
                            in 1964.</p>
                        <p>It tells the story of the nine students who were the first Negroes to
                            enter the previously all white Central High School in Little Rock,
                            Arkansas in 1957. Newsfilm of the actual event depicts the day they
                            entered Little Rock Central High School. The film goes on to show where
                            these nine young people are today tracing their progress to education at
                            the college level, and the progress of Little Rock itself.</p>
                        <p>“Nine From Little Rock” has been distributed to 97 countries around the
                            world by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. For this it has been

                        <p>The Johns Hopkins speech and its peace and economic development proposals
                            have drawn continuing world-wide press response <pb n="120" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_120"/>which is being sustained by initial unofficial
                            Communist reaction and the military episodes of the weekend.<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">On April 7, <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> delivered a speech at Johns Hopkins

                        <p>Most free world commentators agree on the constructive intent and
                            potential of the speech, seeing in it a manifest of U.S. purpose in
                            bringing an honorable peace to Southeast Asia. New U.S. air strikes
                            have, however, underscored the President’s determination to support the
                            struggle in South Vietnam while pressing for negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">Reference is to U.S. airstrikes made against targets

                                in North Vietnam,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, April 6,
                                1965, p. 1)</note>
                            <hi rend="italic">Tokyo Shimbun</hi> expresses “regret” that the U.S.
                            must continue bombing North Vietnamese targets. “Although President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> on April 7 made
                            several proposals to bring peace to Southeast Asia,” the paper laments,
                            “the Communist side has not given them a thought.”</p>
                        <p>A feeling that the speech will endure in its broad applications,
                            regardless of immediate Communist reaction to its proposals, is visible
                            in much comment. Thus, in Australia, yesterday’s <hi rend="italic">Melbourne Age</hi> terms it “a cautious opening for peace,” and the
                            Sydney <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald</hi> judges that “the speech by
                            itself didn’t constitute a diplomatic initiative, but it did delineate
                            the very broad area in which initiatives by any of the nations with
                            interests in the Vietnam war would be acceptable.”</p>
                        <p>Durability of the economic development idea is widely forecast. To some
                            writers it has prospective relevance to much of the world in its
                            politico-economic implications. Thus today’s Vienna <hi rend="italic">Kurier</hi> declares that “the Soviet Union should be very
                            interested in President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s plan,” which could “be a model for the settlement
                            of many similar problems in the developing countries. Perhaps it would
                            even constitute a new kind of guarantee of world peace in general.”</p>
                        <p>Following are some regional features of comment.</p>
                        <p>In the Far East, non-Communist papers have almost unanimously hailed the
                            message, calling it well-balanced, timely, and a progressive step. The
                            onus falls on the Communist side, papers agree, to make a next move.
                            Editors debate whether the policy it expounds is really new, or merely a
                            clarification of standing U.S. attitudes. They also argue about the
                            wisdom of talking and fighting at the same time, and whether the Viet
                            Cong must be included in discussions.</p>
                        <p>On the Hainan episode,<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">Reference is to the
                                April 9 clash between U.S. and Chinese military jets over Hainan
                                Island in the South China Sea.</note> Tokyo’s <hi rend="italic">Yomiuri</hi> is highly critical, feeling that the peace hopes held
                            forth by the speech have been “wrecked.” <pb n="121" facs="0162" xml:id="pg_121"/>Manila papers sharply criticize the Communists for
                            their negative reactions.</p>
                        <p>In Western Europe, praise is general. Papers speak of the President’s
                            “frank and generous offer” of talks without conditions, and his
                                “<persName corresp="#p_MGC_1">Marshall</persName> Plan<note n="5" xml:id="d40fn5">In March 1948, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic

                            Asia.”</p>
                        <p>Many observers felt that the President had radically changed Washington’s
                            basic stand by the “unprecedented gesture” of offering to negotiate
                            directly with governments which are not recognized by the U.S. As the
                                <hi rend="italic">Daily Express</hi> put it, “President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> has met his first major
                            challenge on foreign policy with a firm decision in favor of peace.”</p>
                        <p>The massive aid program suggested for Southeast Asia was granted almost
                            universal support, though a few carping voices were heard. “A great
                            concept,” said Radio Stuttgart’s commentator; “a major contribution” to
                            the economic development of the area offered without “political
                            domination,” said the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>. Many
                            remarked on the general approval the plan was certain to receive in the
                            “third world” of Asian and African countries and praised the President
                            for answering the 17-nonaligned nations so quickly.<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">On April 1, <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> received an appeal to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> from 17 nonaligned

                                the war in Vietnam “without any preconditions.” <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s April 7 speech was
                                interpreted by these nations as the U.S. response to their appeal.

                        <p>The President was said to have offered “the Hanoi government—and China,
                            too—a face-saving approach to the conference table.” West Berlin’s <hi rend="italic">Der Taggespiegel</hi> remarked that the aid program
                            suggested would give North Vietnam “an opportunity to free itself from
                            the unwelcome Chinese embrace.”</p>
                        <p>Reaction to the alleged rejection by Hanoi is not yet available.</p>
                        <p>In the Near East and South Asia, the Cairo press has been highly
                            critical, but since yesterday there is a marked shift of editorial
                            expression toward hope that the peace-talk proposals may be fruitful.
                            Editors warn this country not to overestimate the depth of the
                            Sino-Soviet rift. The Lebanese press gives grudging approval at best,
                            questioning the President’s motives but welcoming his initiative.</p>
                        <p>Indian press reaction has been overwhelmingly favorable, voicing a sense
                            of relief and hope. The peace proposals are seen as leaving “a <pb n="122" facs="0163" xml:id="pg_122"/>broad scope for optimism.” The
                            proposals are seen to prove that the U.S. wants peace and not war.
                            Writers call upon the “non-aligned” nations for speedy implementation of
                            the proposals advanced by the seventeen nations.</p>
                        <p>Reported Israeli comment is all favorable. Turkish and Greek reaction is
                            mixed. The Pakistani press has generally held to news coverage.</p>
                        <p>Latin American reaction has been markedly favorable. Papers have featured
                            the President’s invitation to the Soviet Union to share a development
                            effort. Typically, Bogota’s <hi rend="italic">Tiempo</hi> asserts that
                            the speech “reflects a clear and affirmative desire for peace, putting a
                            solid floor under whatever future discussions may be launched.”</p>
                        <p>African papers have given substantial news coverage to the speech, and
                            only quite limited comment. Criticism centers on the idea that the
                            President’s suggestions were largely a response to unfavorable world
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>After apparent initial hesitation Moscow output attacked the speech as a
                            “propaganda exercise” which reflected no change in U.S. policy in
                            Vietnam. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on April 10 took the lead in
                            attempting to refute the “official” U.S. assertion that the President
                            sought “unconditional discussions” on Vietnam. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> commentator charged that the speech contained no word
                            about any U.S. intention to halt the “aggression” and asked whether U.S.
                            leaders really think that negotiations are possible “under bombings.”
                            Similarly, the President’s proposals for economic development of
                            Southeast Asia are dismissed as “pure propaganda” to divert the
                            attention of world public opinion from their “just wrath” over American
                            aggression in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Other East European capitals generally followed a similar line with only
                            Belgrade still “encouraged” by evidence of a more “realistic and sober”
                            U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>Peiping and Hanoi continue to voice strongly negative attitudes toward
                            the President’s proposals.<note n="7" xml:id="d40fn7">An April 15

                        <p>1. While I support completely our sending in more troops, we must be
                            aware that it will be well nigh impossible to justify the presence of
                            16,000 American troops simply on the grounds that we are protecting
                            Americans and other foreigners.</p>
                        <p>2. We shall have to devote considerable effort to providing evidence that
                            our actions are to protect the short-range and long-range well-being of
                            the people of the Dominican Republic and <hi rend="italic">the rest</hi>
                            of Latin America.</p>
                        <p>3. In order to do this meaningfully, especially when troops are entering
                            during a period of so-called ceasefire, I believe we must exploit as
                            shrewdly as possible, without overdoing it, the Communist and
                                Castroite<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">The reference is to Fidel
                                Castro.</note> leadership of the rebels. This is indicated in the
                            fact that almost all the editorials supporting us in Latin America base
                            their support on the fear that the Dominican Republic might become
                            another Cuba, and thus a menace to the entire hemisphere.</p>
                        <p>4. What I am emphasizing, then, is the need for a two-track information
                            operation—the first being humanitarian, which we can push openly as a
                            government, and the second being the threat to the security of
                            non-Communist nations of Latin America, which would best be pushed by
                            Latin Americans, but which we must encourage in every feasible way.</p>
                        <p>5. If we are to succeed in making other Latin American nations believe
                            that our actions are vital to their safety and freedom, it is of utmost
                            importance that we get some members of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, and perhaps non-<gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                            neighbors of the Dominican Republic like Jamaica, to speak out about the
                            Communist involvement in the Dominican Republic, and to offer troops or
                            other support to our efforts to end the bloodshed.</p>
                        <p><pb n="124" facs="0165" xml:id="pg_124"/>6. Proper consideration of the
                            foregoing points will help to mute the cries of “United States
                            aggression” and “gunboat diplomacy” and perhaps preclude attacks on
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries, embassies and
                            other American installations, with attendant Communist exploitation
                            through Latin America and the world.</p>

                            sending regular reports on press reaction in Latin America, the United
                            States, and other countries around the world to the situation in the
                            Dominican Republic and the actions of the United States, especially the
                            deployment of troops. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country

                            Reports, 5/65) On May 2, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>
                            also started providing the White House with daily memoranda detailing
                            the measures that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was taking “to
                            explain and win support for United States actions and policies in the
                            Dominican Republic.” (Ibid.) These measures included not only the
                            placement of a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> team (see <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>) in Santo Domingo, but also steady
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> commentary supporting United
                            States policy, the production of leaflets and posters for distribution
                            through the country, and, most important according to <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>’s memoranda, the establishment
                            of local radio stations to counter the messaging from rebel-controlled
                            Radio Santo Domingo. This reporting continued throughout May.</p>
                        <p>In a May 4 report, for example, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> noted <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            success, but also challenges: “We have just received solid evidence of
                            the effectiveness of our psychological operation in Santo Domingo, but
                            part of that evidence constitutes a thorny political problem. I have
                            just received word from Hewson <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Ryan</persName> that the leader of the rebels complained to the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> [Organization of American
                            States] Commission about our <pb n="126" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_126"/>leaflet drops and loud-speaker broadcasts and demanded that they be
                            stopped.” He continued: “The 5,000-watt medium wave transmitter was
                            delivered” and “this will increase our audience in the Santo Domingo
                            area by more than 50 per cent.” This station, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> added, “will carry <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> programs and other psychological
                            materials prepared in Santo Domingo, of course.” (Johnson Library,
                            National Security File, Country File, Latin America—Dominican Republic,
                            Box 49, Dominican Republic <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            Psychological Situation Reports, 5/65) As for the rebels, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> in a second update on May 4,
                            stressed: “The rebels continue without an effective radio in the Santo
                            Domingo area. Their “Radio Constitution” continues to broadcast on a
                            series of frequencies, but manages to break through the jamming pattern
                            only infrequently.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Later in the month, in a May 18 situation report, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> reported: “The battle of the
                            airwaves continues as hot as the battle of bullets in Santo Domingo, but
                            once again the stations controlled by the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> team are dominant throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>“The rebels’ output has been reduced to a weak signal, apparently from
                            makeshift facilities, which can be heard only sporadically—and then only
                            in a small area of the Capital.” According to <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName>: “Our mission reports abundant
                            evidence that the stations we control are being listened to closely by
                            Dominicans of all political leanings. Our leaflet, pamphlet and other
                            psychological programs continue at a high level.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In his May 29 psychological situation report, <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> asserted: “<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is moving ahead smoothly and

                            operation. This will include assumption of the publication of the75,000

                            Vietnam</hi></p>
                        <p>American government policy on information matters in Vietnam is based on
                            maximum candor and fullest disclosure of the facts consistent with
                            national security interests.</p>
                        <p>This policy represents a realistic assessment of the role that
                            information activities must play if Vietnamese and American efforts to
                            check communist aggression are to succeed. These efforts must be
                            understood by the Vietnamese people, who are bearing the main burdens of
                            the war. Secondly, they must be understood by the American people who
                            are providing the bulk of outside assistance. Finally, these efforts
                            need the support of the allies of Vietnam and the United States. The
                            chances for success in Vietnam will be seriously compromised if any of
                            these groups feel that they are “not getting the facts,” that the true
                            situation is being concealed or that they are being misled. Therefore,
                            the policy of maximum candor and full disclosure makes sense not only as
                            a traditional element of U.S. government information policies but also
                            as a requirement for the prosecution of a hard, dirty war.</p>
                        <p>This is what is being done. There is no censorship of news copy. There is
                            no “managed news,” no attempt to blink at unsavory facts. The only
                            restriction on newsmen is a request for their voluntary cooperation in
                            matters directly affecting the security of U.S. and Vietnamese forces in
                            the country. Aside from this, newsmen are given a full briefing by a
                            top-level Embassy spokesman on all aspects of U.S. activities in Vietnam
                            once a day, and more often as required. In addition to these briefings,
                            the Embassy makes a continuing effort to get newsmen to the scene of
                            activities outside the Saigon area: the major restriction here is the
                            problem of physical security in areas where Viet Cong guerrillas are
                            active.</p>
                        <p>These arrangements have been worked out over a period of several years,
                            largely as a result of requests by American and other journalists
                            covering the war. Their chief complaint was the lack of overall
                                coordina<pb n="128" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_128"/>tion of official
                            U.S. news output, with the result that, on occasion, spokesmen for
                            individual elements of the American Mission were telling only parts of
                            the story, sometimes in incorrect and contradictory fashion.</p>
                        <p>To meet newsmen’s desires for a more orderly arrangement, the American
                            Embassy instituted new procedures in June 1964.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">The new procedures are detailed in a June 4
                                memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Rowan</persName> to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> and a June 6
                                telegram from the Department of State to Saigon; both are printed,
                                respectively, as <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d197">Documents
                                    197</ref> and <ref target="frus1964-68v01#d203">203 in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, vol. I,
                                    Vietnam, 1964</ref>.</note> The key element in these
                            arrangements was reaffirming and strengthening the Ambassador’s
                            traditional role as the authorized official spokesman for the United
                            States. This role is particularly complex in Vietnam where the
                            Ambassador is in charge of a complex mission comprising both military
                            and civilian elements responsible to a half-dozen Washington agencies.
                            In order that these elements might speak with one voice—i.e., the
                            Ambassador’s—the then-Ambassador, <persName corresp="#p_LHC_1">Henry
                                Cabot Lodge</persName>, designated the director of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry
                                Zorthian</persName>, as his spokesman for the entire mission. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName>, who is a
                            Minister-Counselor of the Embassy, not only coordinates information
                            output within the American Mission but also with his counterparts in the
                            South Vietnamese government. This latter factor is an important one in
                            setting U.S. information policy in Vietnam. Our actions must be guided
                            by the fact that we are in Vietnam in an advisory, not a command
                            capacity. Secondly, our ideas on information policies do not always
                            coincide with those of South Vietnamese officials.</p>
                        <p>With the commencement of air strikes and the further build-up of American
                            forces in South Vietnam early in 1965, these procedures were further
                            refined. The idea of instituting censorship procedures to meet the new
                            security factors involved was reviewed and rejected. The emphasis, as in
                            the past, was placed on voluntary cooperation by the newsmen in
                            respecting the security requirements of individual U.S. installations in
                            South Vietnam. Thus the policy of maximum candor and full disclosure was
                            once again reaffirmed.</p>
                        <p>The consensus of newsmen, both American and foreign, in South Vietnam is
                            that they are getting an accurate running account of U.S. government
                            operations under this arrangement. They may have individual complaints
                            about alleged gaps in Embassy news output, but by and large they agree
                            that the framework for this output, with its reliance on a single
                            authoritative spokesman, is a good one. There is particular praise for
                            the manner in which <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Barry
                                Zorthian</persName> has handled his duties. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> (April 30, 1965) praised “the major
                            improvements <pb n="129" facs="0170" xml:id="pg_129"/>brought by a new
                            civilian information chief in Saigon.”<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">The
                                complete quote in the April 30 editorial is: “Misleading
                                information—foisted upon the nation in past years—continues on a
                                reduced scale, despite major improvements brought by a vigorous, new
                                civilian information chief in Saigon.” (“Information for What?” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, April 30, 1965, p. 34)</note>
                            The difficulties <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName> and his
                            associates have in providing newsmen with a complete picture of American
                            activities in South Vietnam have been noted succinctly by Frank
                            McCulloch in the May 7, 1965 issue of <hi rend="italic">Time:</hi> “I
                            think pointing a finger of blame at any of the exasperated parties in
                            the press-<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>-military conflict is a
                            serious mistake. No one is really at fault. It is just Vietnam.” Despite
                            the Embassy’s attempts to meet these difficult conditions, some
                            criticism continues. In most cases, this criticism is uninformed or is
                            based on the critic’s willingness to ignore the facts. It is useful to
                            review, briefly, the main criticisms.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Censorship.</hi> The critics claim it exists. It
                            doesn’t. No copy coming in or going out of the country is censored by
                            anyone, American or Vietnamese. Newsmen have been briefed on the need
                            for their voluntary cooperation in matters involving security matters;
                            they have been given the ground rules. These rules have been broken by
                            some American and other newsmen, i.e., the disclosure of the use of
                            highly-classified U.S. military equipment. In such instances, the
                            Embassy has little recourse but to remind the offenders of the
                            consequences of their actions for the war effort. Under existing rules,
                            no disciplinary action is taken, nor is any plan for such action being
                            considered at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Role.</hi>
                            Another criticism is that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> should
                            not have the “authorized spokesman” responsibility since its major job
                            is to “put the best face” on American government actions for overseas
                            audiences. Therefore, the argument goes, the American people are being
                            propagandized by their own overseas information agency. This ignores two
                            basic facts. The first is that, for over two decades, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> public affairs officers at our
                            embassies all over the world have been the official spokesmen to both
                            American and local newsmen. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZB_1">Zorthian</persName>’s position is, in this regard, no different
                            from that of his <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> counterparts in
                            105 other countries. The second fact is that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> is not in the business of handing out two versions of
                            the truth, one for American newsmen and the other for local journalists.
                            Any attempts to set up such a double system would be, in one word,
                            disastrous.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Escorts.</hi> A frequent criticism is that the
                            mission requires that American newsmen be accompanied by “escorts” when
                            they visit military installations in Vietnam. In general, such escorts
                            have not been assigned to newsmen; when they have, their role has been
                            to facilitate newsmen’s access to military facilities.</p>
                        <p><pb n="130" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_130"/>4. <hi rend="italic">Transportation.</hi> The charge here is that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and the Embassy do not provide
                            transportation for newsmen to visit areas outside Saigon. The fact is
                            that such facilities are provided whenever feasible. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> played a major role in assuring
                            access by newsmen to the Da Nang base. In other areas, the Embassy
                            arranges transport for newsmen whenever possible. The major restriction
                            is the fact that the Vietnam war is a war of small scattered actions
                            taking place over an immense territory. There are, however, no
                            restrictions on the movement of newsmen throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>In summary, there are information problems in Vietnam and there doubtless
                            always will be as long as the war goes on. However, considerable
                            progress has been made. Suspicions and antagonisms which once
                            characterized relations between the American Embassy and newsmen have
                            been largely dissipated. Unrealistic and unnecessary restrictions have
                            been lifted. Most importantly, the American government now speaks with
                            one voice in South Vietnam in a way that provides a full, credible
                            account of our efforts to assist that troubled country.</p>

                                    1965</hi>, Book I, pp. 506–509.</note> is generally favorable in
                            West Germany, Italy, and Great Britain and mixed in France. British
                            reaction is most often concerned with the President’s warning on “narrow
                            nationalism” which the press interprets as directed against <persName corresp="#p_DGC_1">De Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Some editors focus positively on the President’s call for Atlantic unity
                            but with emphasis on national angles. German papers underscore <pb n="131" facs="0172" xml:id="pg_131"/>passages referring to the
                            German problem. In France the Gaullist<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">Reference is to a supporter of France’s President <persName corresp="#p_DGC_1">de Gaulle</persName>.</note> papers are
                            naturally most critical, although even such an elite paper as <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi>, generally not uncritical of <persName corresp="#p_DGC_1">De Gaulle</persName>, is as censorious of the
                            U.S. as of the French government. <hi rend="italic">Le Monde</hi>
                            declares that the address may “foreshadow a relaunching of the United
                            States’ European policy.” The paper also says that the address was a
                            document “reflecting very faithfully the ways and thinking of American
                            leaders, the style of their reasoning and the logic of their
                            convictions.” An editorial in the same paper is more outspoken in its
                            criticism of the U.S. when it charged that “the stubbornness of the U.S.
                            in wishing to obtain support it demands is as ridiculous as that of
                            French stubbornness which refuses it.”</p>
                        <p>Two of the leading pro-American French papers took a far more positive
                            attitude in their coverage of the address. Both moderate-conservative
                                <hi rend="italic">Le Figaro</hi> and rightist <hi rend="italic">L’Aurore</hi> stress that the President had spoken out against
                            “narrow nationalism.” <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> coverage is factual
                            although its Washington correspondent found much of the speech
                            “inspired” by the declarations of <persName corresp="#p_DGC_1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">L’Aurore</hi>, on the other hand, urges Atlantic
                            cooperation and U.S. friendship when it writes: “Under the protection of
                            this [U.S.] power, we were able to live and to recover. . . . Many
                            Frenchmen are stupified to see French-American friendship threatened.
                            Many Frenchmen remember, and read with joy the words of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> on narrow
                            nationalism which threatens to demolish the Atlantic Alliance and to
                            turn us back to the anguish of twenty years ago.”</p>
                        <p>Mass-circulation <hi rend="italic">France-Soir</hi>, largest of the
                            French dailies and moderately Gaullist, remarks that “for the moment
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> is not
                            attacking <persName corresp="#p_DGC_1">De Gaulle</persName> directly,
                            but in his present state of mind he will certainly do so if criticism
                            continues from Paris with the same virulence.”</p>
                        <p>West German comments are overwhelmingly favorable and centered on the
                            President’s remarks on German affairs. Among the leading papers
                            center-left <hi rend="italic">Suddeutsche Zeitung</hi> states that the
                            “address assumes an importance of its own among the appeals and speeches
                            devoted to the 8th of May. . . . <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> draws lessons from the follies of the past and
                            the most fundamental of these is a strict rebuff to the idea of
                            isolationism. Instead, stress is laid on partnership, primarily
                            partnership with Europe . . . <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> coined a new term in speaking about “Atlantic
                            Civilization.’” The moderate-conservative <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter
                                Allgeimeine Zeitung</hi> headlines: “<persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>—Reunification as a Pressing Problem.”

                            address a “rebuff to European nationalism.”</p>
                        <p>West Berlin papers focus on the remark that “the shame of the East Zone
                            must end.” The independent <hi rend="italic">Spandauer Volksblatt</hi>,
                            in addition, notes the President’s call for improved relations and trade
                            with Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>In Italy, the appeal for Atlantic unity is particularly stressed. Typical
                            of comment in the editorial in liberal <hi rend="italic">La Stampa</hi>
                            (one of Italy’s leading papers) which says: “In substance, <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> has reverted to the essential
                            outlines of the grand design of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>, to wit an Atlantic community linked by a common
                            history and civilization, with even closer relations. . .” Calling the
                            speech of fundamental importance, the paper continues: “The U.S. does
                            not believe in nationalism but works toward closer and deeper
                            interdependence in the Atlantic Community.”</p>
                        <p>Moderate-right <hi rend="italic">Il Tempo</hi>’s editorial is equally
                            laudatory when it praises the President for employing language “of
                            truth, with the lofty force of a leader who sees in the world
                            responsibilities entrusted to him, the stimulus to work not for peace at
                            all costs, but for peace with freedom. The aim of the speech so full of
                            wise and realistic warnings is the relaunching of the Atlantic Alliance;
                            many people in Europe hope that his appeal will be listened to,
                            especially in Paris.”</p>
                        <p>British comments most often single out, as the salient point of the
                            speech, the implied admonition of Gaullist nationalism. The liberal <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> headlines: “<gloss target="#t_LBJ_1">LBJ</gloss> Condemns Gaullist Doctrine” and the conservative <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> carries a headline: “<persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> Asks Europe to Ignore
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC_1">De Gaulle</persName>.” The conservative
                                <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> declares this was the first major
                            speech on European affairs by the President since his inauguration. The
                            paper adds that “never before has he spoken with such force to condemn
                            France’s policies.” The independent <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>
                            remarks that while the President “did not say anything new . . . what he
                            had to say was both timely and reassuring.” The paper says that
                            evidently “Europe was not forgotten” in spite of U.S. preoccupation with
                            Vietnam and the Caribbean.”</p>
                        <p>Sharp criticism of the publicity angle of the address was contained in
                            the highly respected <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> which
                            carried a column from its Washington correspondent titled “Misgivings
                            Over Early Bird Speech”: “President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> has set a cat among the diplomatic pigeons by
                            this Early Bird televised speech. . . . No European government was
                            notified in advance. Technicians were only given a few hours’ notice.
                            Before Early Bird . . . an American President could speak ‘live’ on a

                            should be understood that the following political discussions made up
                            only a small part of the total number of discussions of various types at
                            the Exhibit.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Viet-Nam and the Dominican Republic</p>
                        <p>The question of Viet-Nam was raised numerous times by Soviet viewers in
                            company with small crowds around the guides. Most frequently the
                            question was posed in terms of what the American people think of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy in Viet-Nam. The guides’ answers
                            to the effect that we don’t want war any more than the Soviet people do
                            and that infiltration of South Viet-Nam had been started from the North
                            generally were accepted as the best answers that the guides could give
                            and the question usually was not actively pursued further.</p>
                        <p><pb n="134" facs="0175" xml:id="pg_134"/>Students were more knowledgeable
                            about Viet-Nam in contrast to one man who simply asserted that the
                            Pentagon was responsible. There were several instances of agitators (or,
                            at least hecklers) attempting to embarrass a guide on Viet-Nam, but
                            without success. One Party-liner even extended himself to assert that
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had erected the Berlin Wall, but
                            he was laughed at by the Soviets around him. Most significant, in no
                            instance did the crowds witnessing or taking part in discussion on
                            Viet-Nam seem overly concerned or apprehensive about the situation.</p>
                        <p>American policy in the Dominican Republic was questioned less frequently
                            than was <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName></p>
                        <p>Several times guides were asked what Americans thought of <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName>. One guide answered that
                            Americans were surprised at his being replaced and had not they also
                            been surprised, which drew sheepish admission that they had been. There
                            were some tentative offers that <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> had retired because of age. Another guide
                            answered that many Americans felt sorry for <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName>, and the Soviets found that amusing. Although
                            they acknowledged that Soviet-American relations were better when he was
                            in office, and that this probably was why Americans liked <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName>, the Soviets felt that

                            of man for the job. Some labeled him a blunderer responsible for the
                            present problems in Agriculture. In off-duty private conversations with
                            well-educated Russians similar opinions were offered—that he was a
                            peasant, uncouth, and not the type of man the Soviet Union should have
                            for its leader.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I am enclosing a copy of the excellent notes made by <persName corresp="#p_CCD_1">Dean Chamberlin</persName> of my office at
                                <persName corresp="#p_CTF_1">Terry Catherman</persName>’s debriefing
                            of June 10 on his recent six-week travels in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as escort officer with the Cleveland
                            Orchestra. I urge you to read this document. Based upon my own
                            experience during one week in Moscow and Leningrad, I want to subscribe
                            in the strongest terms possible to everything Terry said. In this
                            document, we have the results of six weeks’ observation of the Soviet
                            scene by a thoroughly experienced and perceptive reporter, as summarized
                            by one of the best note-takers I have ever known.</p>
                        <p>At the risk of briefing an already significantly reduced version of
                            Terry’s remarks, I want to underline the four points he made which I
                            regard as the most important.<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">An unknown hand
                                underlined the word “four.”</note></p>
                        <p>1. There has been a considerable acceleration of the process of
                            relaxation (Terry’s fifth paragraph). This is particularly noticeable
                            when one has not spent any considerable length of time in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for the past two years, as is the
                            case with me, and it is interesting that it struck Terry the same way,
                            since he left his assignment there only a year ago.</p>
                        <p>2. “People couldn’t care less” about Viet-nam and the Dominican Republic
                            (Terry’s sixth paragraph). We must take advantage of this widespread
                            popular attitude by finding every occasion to stress the prospects for,
                            and advantage of, increased Soviet (and Eastern Europe) contact with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and the outside world
                            generally.</p>
                        <p>3. The necessity of increasing the signal strength with which <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Russian gets into the Soviet Union
                            (the second and third paragraphs on page 2). As Terry points out,
                            English is no substitute for Russian in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. It is simply ridiculous that Worldwide English is
                            booming <pb n="137" facs="0178" xml:id="pg_137"/>into this country,
                            while our Russian transmissions are not adequately audible in many
                            places. We are not getting full value for the time, money, and
                            intelligent effort being invested in our most important means of
                            communication with the peoples of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. In <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Russian’s programming we
                            should devote more time to “more advanced forms of music” (Terry’s
                            antipenultimate paragraph), and less to jazz, leaving it to <gloss target="#t_WWE_1">WWE</gloss> to carry the burden of jazz
                            programming.</p>

                            <p>The orchestra was received most enthusiastically. . . “the Russians
                                were spellbound.” The tour went to Moscow, Kiev, Tbilisi, Erevan,
                                Sochi and Leningrad—(the same “tired old cities”). Sochi was
                                superfluous as it is a vacation city and has no concert-going
                                audience. Erevan is also a doubtful location. Some 600 more people
                                were admitted than there were seats and there were fist fights over
                                seats. It was “a roaring mess.” They came to see Americans rather
                                than to listen to the orchestra. The one hundred Armenian-Americans
                                trying to get back to the U.S. captured the sympathy of the
                                orchestra but of course nothing can be done about them. We should be
                                more insistent on insisting on an itinerary of our own choice.</p>
                            <p>By Soviet standards, this was the best organized tour we have ever
                                sent to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Hotel
                                accommodations were good, food all right. Only gripe was that the
                                mail wasn’t on time. For Terry it was a rather boring trip, as it
                                was so routine without any irritating incidents and no problems. But
                                he was left a lot of time to listen to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>The last concert was in Tbilisi on May Day, the first time a foreign
                                group has performed in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> on
                                that day. This extra performance was requested by the Soviets who
                                came to Terry with the request and couldn’t understand why he, as
                                the Director, had to ask the Union <pb n="138" facs="0179" xml:id="pg_138"/>musicians<note n="5" xml:id="d47fn5">Reference
                                    is to the fact that the musicians in the Cleveland Orchestra

                                whether they would perform. Only incident was when a trombonist got
                                drunk and at 3:00 a.m. went into the main square at Tbilisi with a
                                tape recorder to tape the sound of a military convoy. He was
                                arrested but quickly released.</p>
                            <p>He thinks the orchestra was too timid in its selection of American
                                works. They were given good critiques all over the Soviet
                                Union—three or four in each city, in contrast to usual one or two
                                reviews for the whole country. He hadn’t realized how much Soviet
                                music is opening up. They are composing in 12-tone music,<note n="6" xml:id="d47fn6">A musical technique credited to the Austrian

                                compositions along with the classical repertoire. We should send
                                more advanced musical works with orchestras and also <hi rend="italic">on the air.</hi></p>
                            <p>The relaxation of the last two years is continuing; the Soviets are
                                taking life a lot easier. The orchestra just disappeared into homes,
                                dormitories, cafes each night—on invitation. Perhaps this is not so
                                much security relaxation as the fact that the Russians now have
                                better homes in which to entertain. The big housing effort is
                                catching up with demand. All of Terry’s friends now have their own
                                apartments.</p>
                            <p>There were no questions on Vietnam or Dominican Republic (“People
                                couldn’t care less”). Nor on U.S. race relations. Nor about the
                                spacerace (“all propaganda”). They seem glad that <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> (“that bumptious guy
                                with the wild ideas”) has gone. They said <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName> had established
                                “micro-cities” (suburbs) and has let the middle of the cities rot.
                                Now the trend is reversing and they are building up the cities. No
                                one hesitates to mention Stalin—not true last year. They like to
                                talk about “the profit motive”—are all for it. They distrust the
                                Chinese and hate living near them. They know that U.S. standard of
                                living is better. We needn’t tell them <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.</p>
                            <p>“Remember that in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>

                            <p>Acquaintances of Terry told him that in their opinion the credibility

                            <p>Terry mentioned two reports on <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                                which are still useful: one by <hi rend="italic">Scott Lyon</hi> who
                                accompanied <hi rend="italic">Pro Musica</hi> said Worldwide English
                                came in louder and clearer and on more frequencies than the Russian
                                Service of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> which was subject to
                                more interference from local radio stations and faded badly. A
                                report by <hi rend="italic">Dexter Anderson</hi>, covered a trip
                                across the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. He said
                                non-Russian programs came in strong; Russian program signal strength
                                dropped off sharply as one moved away from Moscow. Both programs are
                                strong in Moscow.</p>
                            <p>Terry came to the same conclusion after listening every day to the
                                Voice. Worldwide English came in with a good signal and a good
                                program—especially the off-line commentators. The Russian Service
                                signal was weaker and the program more “monolithic.” But English is
                                    <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a substitute for Russian in

                                listens to him every night.” The Russian Service “hasn’t a chance of
                                competing with him.” A friend of Terry’s told him: “I don’t
                                understand a word of English, but I understand Willis.”</p>
                            <p>The Soviets are developing their own jazz idiom. Even in the hotels
                                they play it well. It is no longer forbidden fruit. Perhaps Russian
                                    <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> should play less jazz and
                                direct its attention to “more advanced forms of music.”</p>
                            <p>Russian <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> isn’t much good. Radio is

                                “still ham-handed.”</p>

                                straight without invective is getting us more and more listeners.

                        <p>To evaluate the psychological implications of the growing U.S. military
                            presence in Vietnam and to determine ways and means of extracting the
                            greatest psychological advantage from this presence while minimizing its
                            adverse impact.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">IT IS PROPOSED THAT:</hi></p>
                        <p>1. All output to all audiences on the subject of the American presence be
                            geared to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s
                            emphasis on the decisive role of U.S. military strength and
                            determination in support of the valiant effort of the Vietnamese people
                            to resist communist aggression and secure peace and independence.</p>
                        <p>2. A consistent, persistent and pervasive effort be sustained to assure
                            association of the American presence with an inevitably successful
                            military effort that will end Vietnam’s decades of war.</p>
                        <p>3. The reason for the American military presence be forthrightly
                            attributed to communist aggression and that the duration of that
                            presence be equated with the time required to make the enemy aggressor
                            cease fighting.</p>
                        <p>4. The U.S. military build-up be presented as a positive measure designed
                            to achieve the level of combined Free World strength which is needed to
                            force the aggressors to accept negotiations for the kind of peace the
                            Vietnamese people want.</p>
                        <p>5. Plans to minimize and localize tensions and frictions between U.S.
                            troops and Vietnamese people presently be determined on the basis of
                            local need.</p>
                        <p>6. All output be guided by the basic fact that the American purpose in
                            Vietnam is to support the Vietnamese people’s struggle for freedom and
                            independence but not to serve as a substitute for the Vietnamese’s own
                            military effort.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><pb n="141" facs="0182" xml:id="pg_141"/><hi rend="roman">ASSUMPTIONS:</hi></p>
                        <p>1. The American presence is a “foreign” presence that unavoidably
                            generates resentments which are likely to grow as the presence grows.
                            This is particularly true in any country that has been previously
                            exposed to foreign domination.</p>
                        <p>2. The people of Vietnam and the world at large understand that the
                            Republic of Vietnam cannot, without assistance, hope to overcome hostile
                            action supported by the resources of the entire communist world.</p>
                        <p>3. The American presence is most vulnerable to attack on political
                            grounds:</p>
                        <quote><p>a. The reality of the growing American involvement and presence in
                                Vietnam will seed charges of “U.S. imperialist” infringement of
                                Vietnamese “sovereignty” and political domination of <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> “lackeys.”</p>
                            <p>b. Vietnamese tend to associate the American presence with in-group
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> politicians and to blame
                                the United States for shortcomings of incumbent <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> administration, their political
                                personalities and their policies.</p></quote>
                        <p>4. Divisive incidents will mount as the U.S. military build-up increases
                            direct contact between American troops and Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">DISCUSSION:</p>
                        <p>The initial Vietnamese reaction to the U.S. military build-up is
                            generally favorable and related psychological problems remain as yet at
                            an acceptable level. This is because our Vietnamese friends tentatively
                            view the American presence as their latest and best hope for
                            successfully ending the war within a reasonable period of time.</p>
                        <p>Our task is to sustain Vietnamese confidence in the fact that the
                            American military presence is linked solely to their war effort, is
                            needed, will be effective and, most importantly, temporary. The key
                            element of our psychological output on the American presence should be a
                            single-minded stress on “decisive American strength and unflagging
                            determination in support of the valiant Vietnamese people’s struggle to
                            resist communist aggression and secure peace and independence.”</p>
                        <p>To the extent that we are successful in applying this clear cut
                            psychological line, the unavoidable negative element of the American
                            presence will be counterbalanced and avoidable problems will be averted
                            or minimized.</p>
                        <p>By focusing on the military nature of the American presence, we reduce
                            attention to sensitive political issues.</p>
                        <p>By stressing our “support” for the Vietnamese people’s struggle against
                            the communist threat, we underscore the decisive but supple<pb n="142" facs="0183" xml:id="pg_142"/>mentary role of Americans in what is
                            essentially a Vietnamese struggle: this eliminates from our output any
                            implication that the Americans are going to fight the war alone.</p>
                        <p>By stressing U.S. support for the “people,” we minimize unfavorable
                            association with <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> political elements
                            and unpopular policies. We must, of course, maintain proper courtesy and
                            respect and avoid any reflection on Vietnamese “sovereignty” in our
                            output. Our watchword should be: “Alliance of two sovereign
                            peoples.”</p>
                        <p>In implementing President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s policy emphasizing U.S. strength and
                            determination, three cautions should be observed. Firstly, we walk a
                            psychological tightrope as regards the timing of inevitable victory over
                            communist aggression. The burgeoning American military presence must be
                            viewed as temporary and effective enough to conclude the war within a
                            reasonable period. But as the initial overly-optimistic Vietnamese
                            reactions to our bombing of the North demonstrated, we must at the same
                            time reduce unrealistic expectations of “quick” victory. We must
                            generate confidence that the victory of the American and Vietnamese
                            peoples is inevitable but not immediately at hand. Our output must avoid
                            the pitfall of attempting to time the victory.</p>
                        <p>A second caution is to play down defensive legalistic assertions that we
                            are here “because” we have been “invited.” For this would unnecessarily
                            focus attention on a sensitive political question and imply that U.S.
                            strength and determination can be nullified by any Saigon coup which
                            happens to produce an “invitation out.” If we must point out that we
                            have been “invited,” let’s not stress that we are here “only because”
                            and “only as long” as the “invitation” holds good.</p>
                        <p>International support of the Vietnamese struggle against the communist
                            aggression should be emphasized but not transparently overdone. There
                            must be no suggestion of a U.S. effort to conceal the dominantly visible
                            American presence under the cloak of “internationalization.”</p>
                        <p>Straightforward emphasis on U.S. strength and determination conforms with
                            the visible realities of the American presence and precludes resort to
                            defensive, apologetic, argumentative, devious and, therefore,
                            ineffective treatment of the subject.</p>
                        <p>Divisive incidents and other adverse effects on the U.S. military
                            build-up will mount as direct contact between U.S. troops and the
                            Vietnamese people increase. Psychological activities should support
                            U.S./Vietnamese efforts to minimize and localize the impact of direct
                            contact. The scope, content and form of these activities should be
                            determined on the basis of local need. They should reflect the nature of
                            U.S. troop discipline and be marked by a courteous and sincere concern
                            for the people of affected communities. Those incidents and sufferings
                                <pb n="143" facs="0184" xml:id="pg_143"/>which in war can never be
                            wholly avoided should be blamed on the enemy who brought this war about.
                            It is, of course, understood that the cultivation of constructive
                            community relations can do much to mitigate tensions.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. military build-up and the strength and determination it implies
                            constitutes the best psychological asset at our disposal for treating
                            the issue of the American military presence in Vietnam. There can be no
                            question but that it has negative implications as well. We must not,
                            however, permit ourselves to be sidetracked by trying to cope with all
                            conceivable negative effects and thereby focusing attention on them
                            because that would mean sacrificing consistency and clear-cut focus to
                            qualifications and equivocations bound to dilute and diffuse the basic
                            message.</p>

                        <p>Many posts have indicated a need for additional materials and support on
                            Viet-Nam and on U.S. policy as it relates to that country. The Agency is
                            planning a number of additional products and projects designed to meet
                            this need, but in order to provide the best possible materials on
                            Viet-Nam we need reports from addressee posts on the problems
                            encountered in attempting to explain the situation in Viet-Nam and
                            suggestions and ideas which could be incorporated into materials
                            produced.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we need details regarding (a) what you have done on
                            Viet-Nam and the response this has evoked in your country, (b) the
                            issues and subjects which are drawing the heaviest criticism, (c) the
                            gaps in information among critics of the Vietnamese situation which
                            could be filled by providing background materials and (d) the types of

                            problems confronting one post, was revealed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW_1">Walt Rostow</persName> of the State Department

                            following six points on which <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>/Tokyo should focus its efforts in explaining the
                            Vietnamese situation:</p>
                        <quote><p><pb n="145" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_145"/>1) Arresting fears that
                                the war in Viet-Nam was escalating toward a broader conflict.</p>
                            <p>2) Explaining the seriousness of military infiltration.</p>
                            <p>3) Countering the widely held belief that the Viet Cong is a genuine
                                nationalist movement.</p>
                            <p>4) Emphasizing that American policies in Asia are not based solely on
                                the use of military power for strategic reasons, but are considerate
                                of Asian aspirations for economic development, national
                                independence, etc.</p>
                            <p>5) Explaining the existing nationalism in South Viet-Nam, which has
                                been concealed by repeated coups in the past 18 months, but which,
                                nonetheless, is a strong force.</p>
                            <p>6) Explaining the 1962 Geneva treaty provisions and calling attention
                                to the repeated violations committed against these during the past
                                three years.<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">The Geneva Agreements of
                                    July 23, 1962, brought to a close the hostilities between left-
                                    and right-wing factions in Laos, and called for the country to
                                    become neutral and for the formation of a tripartite government
                                    that represented the conflicting factions. The agreement,
                                    however, did not hold and conditions continued to deteriorate

                        <p>A radio frequency shortage, which has grown progressively more serious
                            during the past few years, has now reached the point where the Agency’s

                            like to recommend that the U.S. Government as a whole examine the
                            assignment of responsibility for International Broadcasting to be
                            certain that the limited frequencies are made available to the
                            broadcasting interests deemed to have the most pressing need for
                            them.</p>
                        <p>International Broadcasting is a highly competitive field. As you are
                            aware, in the last eight years the world’s effort in this field has more
                            than doubled. At the same time, the number of frequencies available for
                            high frequency broadcasting has remained constant. Simply stated, the
                            problem is one of supply and demand. Despite major technical efforts, it
                            is no longer possible to find the large numbers of frequencies required
                            to support the various independent high frequency broadcasting efforts
                            which, in one way or another, come under the cloak of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>While in Washington on June 21, Mrs. Norman Chandler of the Advisory
                            Commission asked me specifically why both the Voice of America and Radio
                            Free Europe were necessary. I explained to her the basic difference—that
                            the Voice of America speaks for the United States and the government
                            while Radio Free Europe offers a platform for political opposition in
                            exile for Eastern European countries. While I may have been able to
                            justify to Mrs. Chandler the continued existence of both <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and RFE on the basis of their
                            different missions, I could not answer the questions she asked regarding
                            the relative importance of each. She indicated that the foundation she
                            represents cannot vote to make a contribution to RFE until this question
                            is answered.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Presumably a reference to the
                                U.S. Advisory Commission on Information.</note></p>
                        <p><pb n="147" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_147"/>To the best of my knowledge, no
                            attempt has ever been made to answer this question from the point of
                            view of overall U.S. interests. Though I have mentioned <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and Radio Free Europe, I feel we ought
                            to seek the same answer for Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to the
                            Soviet Union, but that we specifically exclude Armed Forces Radio which
                            broadcasts only to our armed forces stationed overseas even though they
                            do have an “eavesdropping audience”.</p>
                        <p>While RFE and Radio Liberty may appear to be compatible with <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, because of their different missions,
                            I am alarmed at the competition they are giving the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> for radio frequencies. The competition
                            is now so keen that in some cases <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>,
                            RFE and Radio Liberty are interfering with each other and with the
                            broadcasts of friendly countries. The interference being caused to the
                            broadcasts of friendly foreign countries is of special concern to us
                            since it blemishes, to a degree, the harmonious relationships that exist
                            between the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and the broadcasting
                            organizations of many of these countries. In addition, Radio Liberty and
                            some of the broadcasts of RFE continue to be jammed by target countries.
                            This often makes it impossible for the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to use adjacent frequencies without also being
                            inadvertently jammed.</p>
                        <p>In a recent technical meeting, held to coordinate the seasonal
                            broadcasting schedules of the various U.S. broadcasting organizations,
                            it was noted that RFE and Radio Liberty in their broadcasts to Iron
                                Curtain<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">This term was used to describe
                                the Soviet Union and Communist countries of Eastern Europe.</note>
                            countries are using daily more than three times the frequency hours of
                            either <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_BBC_1">BBC</gloss>. If for no other reason than the competition that now
                            exists for frequencies, I feel we should push for an examination of the
                            role of each, the relative effectiveness of each, and the share of the
                            limited frequencies each should have to carry out its task.</p>
                        <p>Normally, we compare U.S. and Free World broadcasting efforts to
                            Communist efforts in terms of radio program hours per week, but inasmuch
                            as available frequencies are a major limiting factor, I am attaching for
                            your examination a comparison of frequency hours used daily.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">Attached but not printed is an undated, 1-page table

                        <p>It is significant that <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasting
                            to the entire world in thirty-eight languages uses 815 frequency hours
                            daily, while Radio Free <pb n="148" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_148"/>Europe
                            broadcasting only to Eastern Europe uses 461 and Radio Liberty

                        <p>National policy concerning International Broadcasting has not been
                            reviewed, so far as I can determine, for a great number of years. I
                            suggest that the time has come to review the relative importance of the
                            efforts of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, RFE and Radio Liberty
                            and to determine the relative priority for their use of the limited

                            the Communists, counts heavily in our favor. Most of those spoken to did

                            war with the Chinese. Current common misconceptions are that the Viet
                            Cong control 90% of the country, most Vietnamese do not want the U.S.
                            there, and that there is major opposition by Americans to United States

                            know the latest thinking here on FY66 programing. The most important
                            development is a decision from the highest authority to stress the
                            quality of U.S. leadership at a time when the whole free world is
                            evaluating our performance and presumably shaping its own course of
                            action accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> the other day said
                            the time has come to tell the world more about the Great Society and the
                            aims and accomplishments of the President’s program.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3"><persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>’s
                                statement has not been further identified. The “Great Society”
                                refers to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s initiative of social programs articulated in
                                his May 22, 1964, speech at the University of Michigan. For text of
                                that speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName></hi>, 1963–1964, Book
                                I, pp. 704–707.</note> It is vital that the philosophy and
                            achievement of the Administration be understood. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> agrees that this <pb n="161" facs="0202" xml:id="pg_161"/>is a vital task, and the Agency will
                            undertake a much-increased effort in this direction.</p>
                        <p>Everyone here, including the Director, recognized we have been giving
                            considerable attention to the Great Society, key U.S. legislation, and
                            the Administration’s domestic and foreign programs in general. It is
                            also appreciated that there is no money available for new programing.
                            But the effort in this field must now be increased, reprograming to do
                            it when necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Agency operational priorities and media emphases will be revised to
                            include the Great Society, and the media have been asked for a report on
                            how they might increase their output on this subject. We will keep you
                            informed of plans here as they develop.</p>

                            1965, but he did not assume his duties until September 1, 1965. On
                            August 31, Associate Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark administered the
                            oath of office to <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> at a
                            ceremony held in the Rose Garden at the White House. In his remarks made
                            during the ceremony, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon B.
                                Johnson</persName> thanked outgoing Director <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Carl Rowan</persName> for his service and
                            welcomed <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>. In doing so,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> stressed: “Truth
                            wears no uniform and bears no flag. But it is the most loyal ally that
                            freedom knows. It is the mission, therefore, of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to be always loyal and always
                            faithful and always vigilant to the course of the truth.</p>
                        <p>“The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> now has an opportunity, I
                            think, without parallel in its entire history. The truth about America
                            today, I believe, if you tell it, is stirring and exciting. This is a
                            country that is succeeding. This is a country that is moving forward.
                            This is a country that is confident of its course, a country more
                            devoted than it has ever been to the cause of mankind everywhere.</p>
                        <p>“But truth about America is essentially the truth about freedom—and the
                            story of freedom is the story we want to tell the world.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName></hi>, 1965, Book II, pages 955–956)</p>
                        <p>The following day, <persName corresp="#p_CJW_1">John
                                Chancellor</persName>, a prominent journalist with <gloss target="#t_NBC_1">NBC</gloss> News, joined <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> at the United States Information
                            Agency <pb n="162" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_162"/>when he assumed the
                            Directorship of the Voice of America. Over a month earlier, during a
                            July 28, news conference, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_CJW_1">Chancellor</persName> “is a man whose voice and whose face and
                            whose mind is known to this country and to most of the entire world.”
                            According to <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, “Now, what
                            America is, and was, and hopes to stand for as an important national
                            asset, telling the truth to this world, telling an exciting story, is
                            the Voice of America,” and with <persName corresp="#p_CJW_1">Chancellor</persName>, he was “satisfied that the Voice of America
                            will be in imaginative, competent, reliable, and always truthful hands.”
                            (Ibid., page 798)</p>
                        <p>In brief remarks <persName corresp="#p_CJW_1">Chancellor</persName> made
                            on his first day as the Voice of America Director, he stated: “The news
                            operation of the Voice of America, as I knew it as a listener abroad,
                            and as I have come to know it in recent weeks, is a professional news
                            operation of high quality. It functions well, and its standards of
                            excellence are acknowledged abroad. That is as it should be. We do not
                            serve the needs of an American audience; our competition is found in the
                            products of other countries. Some of these are virtuous, some are not.
                            There is, therefore, a particular responsibility placed upon the news
                            department of the Voice: our product must be deadly accurate, and it
                            must be as fast as yesterday’s rumor or today’s slander. Speed is
                            essential to any healthy and vigorous news operation; but to us,
                            recognizing as we do the political realities of our time, speed is
                            vital, for we are deeply involved in these political realities,
                            representing, as we do, the official voice of the Government we serve.
                            If a commercial broadcaster makes a mistake, he can run a correction. If
                            we stumble, America stumbles. It is fundamental to our performance that
                            we acknowledge this responsibility. It places upon us a special burden
                            of truth and accuracy. Our task is to make the policies of the
                            Government of the United States clearly and explicitly understood around
                            the world, with no chance for any misunderstandings. (Remarks made by

                        <p>As you are aware, the President and the National Security Council have
                            given the Director of the U.S. Information Agency the overall

                            as possible, I believe it is desirable to define areas of responsibility
                            among the field agencies in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The division of labor between our respective field organizations has
                            already been worked out in Viet-Nam by appropriate officials and has

                            field.</p>
                        <p>A most significant operational level, where our personnel engaged in the
                            overall psychological effort have their closest contact with the
                            problems and the greatest opportunity to take action leading to their
                            direct solution, is at the province (sector) headquarters. I do not
                            believe that we should attempt to define rigid concepts for this echelon
                            beyond the general statement of responsibility already issued by the
                            U.S. Mission Council, for the needs differ from province to province and
                            as the situation changes. I propose that we continue to allow these
                            arrangements to be worked out on the ground between <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss> under the general authority and responsibility granted
                            to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and its principal
                            representative in Viet-Nam, recognizing that the numbers of skilled
                            personnel available for this task—whether they are from military or
                            civilian manpower resources—are likely to fall short of requirements for
                            some time to come. Assignments to these duties will depend on need,
                            priorities, and availability.</p>
                        <p>If you concur, I would suggest that we agree to inform appropriate
                            officials in our respective agencies that this letter constitutes a

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cater</persName> called Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>, said he had been trying to get
                            the President to give a speech on the subject of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>’s memorandum re Task Force in
                            Education and to kick this off with what could be a broad outline of the
                            program as touched on by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> He asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> to take on the job of drafting such an outline,
                            which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> agreed to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cater</persName> mentioned that the
                            President was speaking to the Smithsonian Institution gathering on
                            September 18, at the large international Bicentennial Celebration.<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s September 16 “Remarks at the Smithson
                                Bicentennial Celebration.” See <ref target="#d60">Document
                                60</ref>.</note> He thought that would be a good occasion for such a
                            speech, in the presence of so many scholars from all over the world. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> also mentioned a
                            Princeton speech as a good possibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cater</persName> said he thought the
                            Smithsonian seemed even more appropriate an occasion since he could tell
                            all these foreign scholars that the President has given education the
                            highest priority at home; it doesn’t stop at the water’s edge; that he
                            wants to set up a special White House Task Force to bring all of us
                            together, etc. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cater</persName> thought
                            this could be an important speech and could set the guide lines that
                            will permit Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> to
                            operate in a way useful to him in the future. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> asked how much he would want in
                            the speech as to the announcement of a new doctrine; <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cater</persName> mentioned it was hard for a
                            President to announce a new <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> doctrine, it should be written so that the press
                            will say he announced a clear new initiative. <persName corresp="#p_CSD_1">Cater</persName> asked if he could have about
                            3000 words over the weekend which they could discuss on Monday at
                                lunch.<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">September 13. No record of this
                                meeting was found.</note> Said he had a call in to Smithsonian to
                            get that institution involved in this too; suggested that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> mentioned two books
                            that could be quoted from: Alfred North Whitehead, “The Aims of
                                Education,”<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">Reference is to the American

                            things: (1) it conducts the overseas cultural and educational programs

                            exchange of students, leaders and specialists, <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> scholars and teachers; (2)
                            it conducts its own cultural and educational programs: libraries, book
                            programs, binational centers, English teaching, American studies, music
                            programs, trade fairs and East-West exhibitions. (Most of these <pb n="167" facs="0208" xml:id="pg_167"/>cultural programs were
                            authorized under the <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MKE_1">Mundt</persName> Act;
                            the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HOE_1">Hays</persName> legislation superseded it.)</p>
                        <p>The largest part of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s job is
                            described in the <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MKE_1">Mundt</persName> Act as “disseminating
                            information about the United States.” This includes cultural and
                            educational information as well as direct foreign policy information.
                            Thus all <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media are engaged in
                            “cultural-information” programs.</p>
                        <p>When <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was created in 1953, the
                            dissemination of information, including cultural media, was separated
                            from the educational exchange program in Washington. One result,
                            however, was that the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>), which kept the exchange of persons,
                            became known as a “cultural program” involving <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> while <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, which
                            continued to operate all of the cultural programs which involved <hi rend="italic">things</hi> (books, English lessons, musical
                            recordings, etc.) and the information programs about cultural and
                            educational institutions in the U.S., became known as an “information”
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Overseas, no such confusion regarding division of labor exists. The
                            Public Affairs Officer is responsible for all of these programs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Philosophies</p>
                        <p>There are two schools of thought. One would describe cultural and
                            educational exchange programs as “culture for culture’s sake”<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3"><persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Charles
                                    Frankel</persName> says “Educational and cultural relations are
                                important in the end, because they are educational and cultural
                                relations.” [Footnote is in the original.]</note> which would, at
                            best, result in “mutual understanding.” The other would describe <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as a “propaganda” program which, by
                            manipulating the facts about the U.S. and its foreign affairs, tries to
                            gain acceptance for U.S. policies.</p>
                        <p>Though these two extreme views constantly plague <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, there is a middle ground which is achieved by meshing

                        <p><gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> officers, and to a lesser extent

                        <p>As applied to operations, the first of these two philosophies results in
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs that relate far less to
                            immediate political objectives than to a long-range goal of achieving
                            “mutual understanding.” For example, selecting U.S. students for
                            political sophistication as well as academic excellence, though felt to
                            be of importance by one politically sensitive arm of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, is questioned by the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> Advisory Committee and the Board of
                            Foreign Scholarships. Generally however, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> does apply some political criteria, especially to its
                            American Specialist and its Foreign Leader programs.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is not satisfied that this is done
                            to a sufficient degree. The Agency applies political criteria rigorously
                            to its cultural and educational programs. For example, English teaching
                            is used to reach foreign leaders or to deliver a cultural and
                            informational message to students. Our mandate is to present “those
                            aspects of American life and culture which facilitate sympathetic
                            understanding of American policies.”</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> often applies these political
                            criteria to the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs which it
                            administers overseas and in its advisory capacity to <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in Washington. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> feels that this is an intrusion into its own affairs and
                            a violation of the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HOE_1">Hays</persName>

                            Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, have joined <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in their disapproval of the Agency’s
                            handling of its own and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s cultural
                            and educational programs.</p>
                        <p>Among the elements of the problem, as they see it, are these:</p>
                        <p>—Cultural officers in the field are under constant pressure to apply
                            political criteria to the exchange program, which the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HOE_1">Hays</persName> Act defines as essentially non-political.</p>
                        <p>—The Agency places first priority on direct policy statements and their
                            interpretations via the fast media. Thus <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s own cultural media are not as well-financed as its
                            fast media, and receive less top level attention.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> assigns its weaker officers to
                            cultural affairs assignments.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cultural media are eliminated
                            first when budget cuts come: libraries, English teaching, binational
                            centers, American studies, music, lectures, etc. are the first, not the
                            last, to go.</p>
                        <p>—Top personnel in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> have been chosen
                            predominantly with information rather than cultural backgrounds. Only
                            one-third of the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s have had
                            experience as Cultural Officers. No present Area or Media Director has
                            served as a <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>. Only one of the top
                            six officers above them has ever served as a <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In sum, these people feel that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is
                            not a hospitable base from which to conduct cultural programs.</p>
                        <p>Most of these people agree with one or the other of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>’s proposed solutions: (1) A
                            semi-autonomous foundation which would conduct all U.S. government
                            cultural and educational programs, or (2) the upgrading of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in the State Department accompanied by
                            the absorption of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cultural
                            programs and the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>’s. Then, they
                            feel, cultural and educational exchange could achieve excellence free
                            from the taint of propaganda and from the press of immediate foreign
                            policy and political considerations.</p>
                        <p>I believe:</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s and <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>’s conduct the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                            exchange programs in keeping with guidelines set by the Ambassador and
                            in accordance with <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> instructions,
                            bearing in mind political objectives.</p>
                        <p><pb n="170" facs="0211" xml:id="pg_170"/>—Cultural content, though
                            important, is relatively less so than the dissemination of information
                            which will achieve U.S. political objectives.</p>
                        <p>—Personnel assignments to <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> are being upgraded. A number of top
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers are now assigned to
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> regrets the loss of the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                            position.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has been required to cut back in
                            Europe across the board, and cultural programs have suffered.</p>
                        <p>In sum, I think that U.S. government cultural programs should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be separate from U.S. government
                            informational-political programs. They are mutually supporting and
                            should continue to be so.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Future</p>
                        <p>As we discussed in the corridor on Friday,<note n="6" xml:id="d59fn6">September 10.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>’s political orientation
                            under <persName corresp="#p_MHC_1">Harry McPherson</persName> does not
                            seem to have been total.</p>
                        <p>On the exchange program specifically, we are under several pressures. The
                            Emphasis on Youth Program could accommodate the entire budget, so could
                            the Labor Leader Program, so could the Journalist Program, vis-à-vis
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>I think you will find that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> will continue with his culture for culture’s
                            sake approach, his expressed desire (soon to be published in his book

                            government agencies, and possibly the idea of making cultural affairs
                            much more important in the Department of State than what attaches to an
                            Assistant Secretary equated with area Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                        <p>If we had unlimited funds, we could presumably accommodate all these
                            competing interests. As it is, I think we have to look at the national
                            interest and program accordingly.</p>
                        <p>You spoke of getting something in writing from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>. I am not sure that it would be
                            either possible or desirable at this point. What we need, I think, is a
                            commitment from him that from within the limited budget of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> we take care of specific priorities
                            which are essentially political in nature: youth, labor, government,
                            journalism.</p>
                        <p><pb n="171" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_171"/>While he may agree to this over
                            lunch, I think we are going to have a running battle because his

                            was a scientist who achieved no great distinction. He was an Englishman
                            who never visited the United States. He never even expressed a desire to
                            do so.</p>
                        <p>But this man became our Nation’s first great benefactor. He gave his
                            entire fortune to establish this Institution which would serve “for the
                            increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”</p>
                        <p>He had a vision which lifted him ahead of his time—or at least of some
                            politicians of his time. One illustrious United States Senator argued
                            that it was beneath the dignity of the country to accept such gifts from
                            foreigners. Congress debated 8 long years before deciding to receive
                            Smithson’s bequest.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">The Smithsonian
                                Institution was established by Congress in 1846.</note></p>
                        <p rend="center"><pb n="172" facs="0213" xml:id="pg_172"/>James Smithson’s
                            Legacy</p>
                        <p>Yet James Smithson’s life and legacy brought meaning to three ideas more
                            powerful than anyone at that time ever dreamed.</p>
                        <p>The first idea was that learning respects no geographic boundaries. The
                            Institution bearing his name became the first agency in the United
                            States to promote scientific and scholarly exchange with all the nations
                            of the world.</p>
                        <p>The second idea was that partnership between Government and private
                            enterprise can serve the greater good of both. The Smithsonian
                            Institution started a new kind of venture in this country, chartered by
                            act of Congress, maintained by both public funds and private
                            contributions. It inspired a relationship which has grown and flowered
                            in a thousand different ways.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Institution financed by Smithson breathed life in the idea
                            that the growth and the spread of learning must be the first work of a
                            nation that seeks to be free.</p>
                        <p>These ideas have not always gained easy acceptance among those employed
                            in my line of work. The Government official must cope with the daily
                            disorder that he finds in the world around him.</p>
                        <p>But today, the official, the scholar, and the scientist cannot settle for
                            limited objectives. We must pursue knowledge no matter what the
                            consequences. We must value the tried less than the true.</p>
                        <p>To split the atom, to launch the rocket, to explore the innermost
                            mysteries and the outermost reaches of the universe—these are your
                            God-given chores. And even when you risk bringing fresh disorder to the
                            politics of men and nations, these explorations still must go on.</p>
                        <p rend="center"> Ideas, Not Armaments</p>
                        <p>The men who founded our country were passionate believers in the
                            revolutionary power of ideas.</p>
                        <p>They knew that once a nation commits itself to the increase and diffusion
                            of knowledge, the real revolution begins. It can never be stopped.</p>
                        <p>In my own life, I have had cause again and again to bless the chance
                            events which started me as a teacher. In our country and in our time we
                            have recognized, with new passion, that learning is basic to our hopes
                            for America. It is the taproot which gives sustaining life to all of our
                            purposes. And whatever we seek to do to wage the war on poverty or to
                            set new goals for health and happiness, to curb crime or try to bring
                            beauty to our cities and our countryside—all of these, and more, depend
                            on education.</p>
                        <p>But the legacy we inherit from James Smithson cannot be limited to these
                            shores. He called for the increase and diffusion of knowledge <pb n="173" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_173"/>among men, not just Americans,
                            not just Anglo-Saxons, and not just the citizens of the Western
                            World—but all men everywhere.</p>
                        <p>The world we face on his bicentennial anniversary makes that mandate much
                            more urgent than it ever was. For we know today that certain truths are
                            self-evident in every nation on this earth; that ideas, not armaments,
                            will shape our lasting prospects for peace; that the conduct of our
                            foreign policy will advance no faster than the curriculum of our
                            classrooms; that the knowledge of our citizens is the one treasure which
                            grows only when it is shared.</p>
                        <p>It would profit us little to limit the world’s exchange to those who can
                            afford it. We must extend the treasure to those lands where learning is
                            still a luxury for the few.</p>
                        <p>Today, more than 700 million adults—4 out of 10 of the world’s
                            population—dwell in darkness where they cannot read or write. Almost
                            half the nations of this globe suffer from illiteracy among half or more
                            of their people. And unless the world can find a way to extend the
                            light, the force of that darkness may ultimately engulf us all.</p>
                        <p rend="center"> A New Beginning</p>
                        <p>For our part, this Government and this Nation are prepared to join in
                            finding the way. During recent years we have made many hopeful
                            beginnings. But we can and we must do more. That is why I have directed
                            a special task force within my administration to recommend a broad and
                            long-range plan of worldwide educational endeavor.</p>
                        <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Dean Rusk</persName> has
                            accepted my request to chair this task force. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">John Gardner</persName> of the Department of
                            Health, Education, and Welfare has agreed to serve on it. Both these men
                            have proved, in their past careers, how great is their devotion to
                            international education.</p>
                        <p>I intend to call on leaders in both public and private enterprise to join
                            with us in mapping this effort.</p>
                        <p>We must move ahead on every front and at every level of learning. We can
                            support Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RSD_1">Ripley</persName>’s dream
                            of creating a center here at the Smithsonian where great scholars from
                            every nation will come and collaborate. At a more junior level, we can
                            promote the growth of the school-to-school program started under Peace
                            Corps auspices so that our children may learn about—and care about—each
                            other.</p>
                        <p rend="center">An International Effort</p>
                        <p>We mean to show that this Nation’s dream of a Great Society does not stop
                            at the water’s edge: and that it is not just an American dream. All are
                            welcome to share in it. All are invited to contribute to it.</p>
                        <p>Together we must embark on a new and a noble adventure:</p>
                        <p><pb n="174" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_174"/>First, to assist the education
                            efforts of the developing nations and the developing regions.</p>
                        <p>Second, to help our schools and universities increase their knowledge of
                            the world and the people who inhabit it.</p>
                        <p>Third, to advance the exchange of students and teachers who travel and
                            work outside their native lands.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, to increase the free flow of books and ideas and art, of works of
                            science and imagination.</p>
                        <p>And, fifth, to assemble meetings of men and women from every discipline
                            and every culture to ponder the common problems of mankind.</p>
                        <p>In all these endeavors, I pledge that the United States will play its
                            full role.</p>
                        <p>By January, I intend to present such a program to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Despite the noise of daily events, history is made by men and the ideas
                            of men. We—and only we—can generate growing light in our universe, or we
                            can allow the darkness to gather.</p>
                        <p>De Tocqueville challenged us more than a century ago: “Men cannot remain
                            strangers to each other, or be ignorant of what is taking place in any
                            corner of the globe.”<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">Reference is to the

                        <p>As of today, I am combining the Agency’s Motion Picture Service and
                            Television Service into one audio-visual media service.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that the Agency will provide a greater service to its
                            objectives, with significant economies and efficiencies, through a
                            merger of its audio-visual resources.</p>
                        <p>This new combined service will be under the direction of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC_1">George Stevens</persName>, former director of the
                            Motion Picture Service. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Alan
                                Carter</persName>, former head of the Television Service and a
                            career foreign service officer of the Agency, is needed in a new
                            position which will be announced in the near future.</p>
                        <p>There are certain precepts of management and organization that must
                            accompany this merger, and I stress them here for the guidance of all
                            concerned:</p>
                        <quote><p>First,the merger of these two activities must take advantage of
                                the similarities in objectives and facilities that the two services
                                possess. I expect from this combined organization a significant
                                reduction in costs and positions.</p>
                            <p>Second,the merger of these two activities must recognize the
                                differences and the unique capabilities of the two media to meet the
                                Agency’s objectives. I expect nothing in this combined organization
                                to hamper the effectiveness of either outlet.</p>
                            <p>Third,the merger of the two activities must respond to the basic
                                requirements of the Agency world-wide, the Area in general, and the
                                individual post in particular. I expect from this combined
                                organization a responsive service in every meaning of the
                            word.</p></quote>

                        <p>Pending final recommendations of the Committee, which I expect within
                            thirty days, the Motion Picture Service and the Television Service will
                            continue to operate as at present. I appreciate that this step will
                            involve some disruptions during the transition period. I will make every
                            effort to assure a smooth transition in operations and staffing, with
                            full consideration of the people involved. I know that all concerned
                            will cooperate fully to maintain and improve the quality and

                        <p>For many years the Agency has hired top cultural figures for selected

                        <p>Last year we agreed to increase our efforts to obtain such people (see
                            attached letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MHC_1">McPherson</persName>).<note n="6" xml:id="d62fn6">Attached but not

                        <p>While we are eager to take as many top cultural and educational figures
                            as we have places for, there are several problems:</p>
                        <p>1. Most such people are not willing or able to take a two-year
                            assignment.</p>
                        <p>2. Our salaries, even at the <gloss target="#t_FSR_1">FSR</gloss>–1 and 2
                            levels, are not equal to theirs.</p>
                        <p>3. Except for a few language and area specialists, most such people do
                            not have a working command of a foreign language.</p>
                        <p>4. It is an expensive process for us—(a) they command a high salary, and
                            (b) we must really create a new position for them, since someone else is
                            necessary to administer the complex of cultural programs.</p>
                        <p>Bob <persName corresp="#p_LRA_1">Lincoln</persName> reports, “When you
                            bring in for two years a professor or scholar as <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>, you’ve got to back him up with a
                            rugged staff that can handle all of the normal bureaucratic stuff from
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and elsewhere. <pb n="178" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_178"/>You cannot expect your scholar to do
                            it—you don’t want him to. Thus, you really have to add a new position to
                            your ceiling at that post.”</p>
                        <p>Our feeling is that the results which the Secretary desires can be
                            effected best through the American Specialist program, sending such
                            people for a year as a “scholar-in-residence” and attaching them to a
                            university or a binational or cultural center.</p>
                        <p>The following people are the kind of top cultural figures who might be
                            able to do the job either as a cultural attaché or as a
                            “scholar-in-residence”; they must be checked for suitability and
                            personality as well as security before the Agency endorses them.</p>

                        <p>(1) We want to use the aspirations and the accomplishments of the Great
                            Society as a means to show important audiences that (a) the United
                            States, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, and
                            his Administration are committed to a great and attainable program to
                            improve the quality of American life, and (b) this program has meaning
                            to foreign peoples.</p>
                        <p>(2) We want to demonstrate that, even while deeply committed to the
                            defense of free nations and free institutions in many parts of the
                            world, the U.S. is equally committed to the preservation and the
                                devel<pb n="181" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_181"/>opment of the basic
                            American institutions which provide this nation with the strength and
                            vigor required to meet its foreign commitments.</p>
                        <p>(3) We want the Great Society to illustrate what “government of the
                            people, by the people, and for the people”<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">The quotation is from President <persName corresp="#p_LRA_1">Lincoln</persName>’s November 19, 1863, “Gettysburg
                                Address.”</note> means—how progress toward national goals engages
                            the effort of many individuals acting through a wide variety of
                            voluntary, nongovernmental and civic groups, and how the system of free
                            choice encourages and responds to the concern and initiative of its
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>(4) Recognizing that every people has its own ideals of excellence, we
                            want to suggest American readiness to learn from the experience of other
                            peoples in progressing toward peaceful goals, and to share the evolving
                            American experience of the Great Society where it is applicable.</p>
                        <p>(5) We want to convince people that a nation so committed to the Great
                            Society could not strive less energetically for peace or refrain more
                            steadfastly from aggression or aspirations for territorial gain or
                            political domination.</p>
                        <p>(6) We want to demonstrate that a nation which can afford the Great
                            Society must be a strong and reliable friend and ally and, if necessary,
                            a determined adversary.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Cautions</hi></p>
                        <p>(1) Never suggest that the United States promises to bring the fruits of
                            the Great Society to all people, everywhere, lest the Great Society be
                            interpreted as some sort of vast foreign aid project.</p>
                        <p>(2) Use extreme care in projecting “the American standard of living” as
                            requiring improvement, for that standard already is considered beyond
                            the hopes and expectations of numerous peoples especially in the
                            developing areas.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The basic authority of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (Public Law
                            402 of 1948) requires the Agency “to disseminate <hi rend="italic">abroad</hi> information about the United States, its people and
                            policies.” While there is no specific statutory provision prohibiting
                            the Agency from making its material available to American audiences,
                            Congressional intent is clear in that respect and leaves no room for
                            doubt.</p>
                        <p>Various educational groups, Congressmen, and other special interests are
                            continually pressuring the Agency for release of materials usually for
                            only limited distribution. Oftentimes these requests may legitimately be
                            granted, eg., where the target audience is a special foreign group
                            within the United States. In any event, refusal of such requests
                            frequently has adverse repercussions almost as serious as those which
                            might result from unauthorized release.</p>
                        <p>In short, this whole matter of domestic distribution is a very real
                            problem and one which requires constant vigilance in order to keep us
                            out of trouble. The only apparent solution is clarifying
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>On September 23, 1965, Congress adopted a joint resolution (S. J. <gloss target="#t_Res_1">Res</gloss>. 106) to allow the showing in the
                            United States of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> film
                                “<persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F. Kennedy</persName>—Years of
                            Lightning, Day of Drums”<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">Produced by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and released in 1964. See <ref target="#d30fn4">footnote 4, Document 30</ref>.</note> by
                            transferring six master copies of this film to the trustees of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F. Kennedy</persName> Center for
                            the Performing Arts upon the payment of $122,000 which would reimburse
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> for expenses in producing the
                            film. The Kennedy Center was given exclusive rights to distribute this
                            film through commercial and educational media for viewing within the
                            United States. This report referred to the previous Congressional
                            statements that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-produced films
                            should not “be made available for public showing in this country except
                            pursuant to a specific legislative authorization.”</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><pb n="183" facs="0224" xml:id="pg_183"/><hi rend="roman">A.</hi> Arguments in support of proposed recommended
                            legislation:</p>
                        <p>Briefly, experience has demonstrated that some of the films made by
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> have great educational value
                            for U.S. audiences and do not fall into the category of “domestic
                            propaganda.” If these films were made available to domestic groups, the
                            following advantages would result:</p>
                        <p>1. It would increase the knowledge of the U.S. public about foreign
                            policy. This is important for several reasons. Because of the nature of
                            our society, the people of the U.S. have more direct influence on
                            foreign policy than the people of any other country in the world.
                            Further, we have four million tourists going abroad annually and it
                            would be useful if they were better informed on foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>2. Use of selected <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films in the
                            schools would serve as a valuable educational tool in the field of
                            foreign affairs, which is still not adequately covered, generally
                            speaking, in current curricula.</p>
                        <p>3. Showing of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films would give the
                            U.S. taxpayer some knowledge of what we are doing with his dollar. This
                            may lead to greater interest in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            as a whole, and with it increased general knowledge and understanding of
                            what we do. If our case is good, it may thus also lead to greater public
                            support for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. The distribution of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films
                            throughout the U.S. would result in a greater return from the investment
                            made, without any substantial additional expenses. This distribution
                            will require merely additional prints, cost of which would be nominal
                            compared to the initial cost of producing the film.</p>

                        <p>1. A substantial element in the U.S. press has in the past opposed the
                            showing of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films at home. For
                            example, Russ Wiggins<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">Editor and executive

                                1968, when he became U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.</note>
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> has consistently opposed
                            this distribution on emotional rather than philosophic arguments.
                            However, it is possible that prior consultation may reduce or eliminate
                            this opposition.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would expose itself to another
                            hundred million critics. Perhaps more importantly, our producers—and
                            particularly our contractors—may have their judgment influenced by the
                            knowledge that they are producing for a domestic audience instead of an
                            exclusive foreign audience.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films publicly shown could and
                            probably would become the subject of partisan political arguments.
                            Particularly those looking <pb n="184" facs="0225" xml:id="pg_184"/>for
                            issues will find support or opposition for one party or another (or a
                            particular foreign position) in our films, or at least be able to allege
                            it.</p>
                        <p>4. A program to show films domestically would create a complexity of
                            problems, distribution, financing, pricing for and selection of
                            commercial distributors and <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> stations
                            and networks, etc., which would require many man hours of work and
                            repeated sensitive policy decisions.</p>
                        <p>5. Critics of the Administration could use any move to show our films
                            domestically as one more basis for the charge of “news management.” As
                            you know, there is already a widespread suspicion that this
                            Administration is bending <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to
                            partisan purposes in its overseas output.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">CONCLUSIONS:</p>
                        <p>After considerable reflection, I would recommend the following:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. It would not be desirable to have all films or other media
                                products of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> distributed
                                domestically.</p>
                            <p>2. Some films contain information and additional material which could
                                be shown to the American public. Specifically, products such as the
                                Kennedy film, documentaries on the visit of foreign dignitaries and
                                feature films such as “Night of the Dragon”<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">Produced by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and released in 1966.</note> on the issue of
                                Vietnam could provide material of substance and value, without
                                provoking controversy.</p></quote>
                        <p>In the past, Congress has recognized that certain films should be shown
                            to the American public and has authorized specific legislation for this
                            purpose. However, it is obviously cumbersome to require a joint
                            resolution of the House and Senate each time that a film is produced of
                            this nature.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I would recommend the creation of a joint committee of the
                            House and Senate which would review <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films and determine which should be made available for
                            domestic distribution, and through what channels the films would be
                            distributed and exhibited. This committee should be bi-partisan with an
                            equal number of Republicans and Democrats. To remove any question of
                            political partisanship, I would suggest the resolution provide that no
                            film should be released unless two-thirds of the committee approve.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Lionel:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am very happy indeed that you will be able to attend our meeting in
                            Washington on November 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">No record of this
                                meeting has been found.</note></p>
                        <p>I hope you will come to my office a little before noon on that day. We
                            will have lunch here in the State Department and then come back to my
                            office for conversation. The meeting will end at 4 p.m.</p>
                        <p>My office is Room 6218. I would recommend that you enter the building at
                            the C Street entrance.</p>
                        <p>The central purpose of our conversation will be to explore ways and means
                            of finding or developing cultural representatives who can represent us
                            with distinction in our embassies abroad. I hope the conversation will
                            provide us with the beginning of a list of the names of people who, over
                            the course of the next two or three years, may be available for such
                            positions. We are, of course, interested in finding distinguished people
                            in private life—in the universities, in literature, the arts or the
                            foundations—and not only in combing the list of people currently in
                            Government service. I hope that our conversation will also help to
                            clarify the nature and conditions of the job of cultural representative
                            and indicate the ways in which it can be made attractive to men of high
                            accomplishment.</p>
                        <p>At present, we are concentrating on finding men for our larger and most
                            important posts—for example, London, Paris, Rome, Bonn, New Delhi,
                            Tokyo, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, etc. In certain of these posts, we
                            now have satisfactory people, but, of course, we cannot count on being
                            able to replace them adequately unless we make careful plans well in
                            advance.</p>
                        <p>You are probably well enough acquainted with our embassies abroad to know
                            something about the way in which the job of the Cultural Attaché is at
                            present defined, but we shall provide you with detailed information at
                            the time we meet. In thinking about this subject, however, I hope you
                            will not restrict yourself to thinking in terms of <pb n="186" facs="0227" xml:id="pg_186"/>what now exists, but will draw up your
                            own description of the position as you think it should be.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a list of the people who are expected to attend the
                                meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">Attached but not printed.

                            at the U.N. were broadcast in full. Statements by <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Anthony Solomon</persName>, Under Secretary of

                        <p>In addition to the many correspondents’ reports, and commentaries and
                            editorial roundups by our Central Program Services Division, the Spanish
                            Branch aired a special 15-minute program on the Dominican Republic which
                            included interviews with <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                            Secretary-General Jose Mora, Elis Antonio Perez (a Dominican
                            journalist), and Cesar Ortiz (a U.N. observer). Along with daily <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and U.N. spots were statements by
                            Colonel Oswaldo Lopez A., Chief of the Honduran Government; and by
                            Francisco J. Orlich, President of Costa Rica. Several interviews were
                            recorded in Santo Domingo, including one with the Guatemalan Ambassador
                            in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <p>Effectiveness of the Spanish Branch broadcasts is evidenced by the fact
                            that more than ninety stations in ten Latin American countries
                            rebroadcast portions of the Spanish programs or relayed the news
                            directly, via medium wave, to their listeners.</p>
                        <p>During the period May 1, 1965, through May 25, 1965, the following
                            material was included in the Spanish Branch broadcasts on the situation

                        <p>All of the 315 programs were directly concerned with events leading up to
                            and throughout the crisis.</p>
                        <p>Due to the explosive situation, the Spanish Branch modified its 9-hour
                            schedule on Saturday, May 1, and began broadcasting 24 hours a day to
                            Latin America. The Brazilian Branch remained on its usual schedule, but
                            included a great amount of material on the Dominican Republic in its
                            broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>From May 1 until May 12, all of the Spanish programs were devoted
                            exclusively to the Dominican question. On May 12, the Branch resumed its
                            usual 9-hour daily schedule, with emphasis, however, on Dominican <pb n="189" facs="0230" xml:id="pg_189"/>developments. In addition, it
                            continued its broadcasts beamed directly to the Dominican Republic
                            during the hours of 12:30 AM to 7:00 AM, 10:00 AM through 6:30 <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>. Programs during the 14½ hours to the
                            Republic included a 15-minute newscast on the hour, a 5-minute newscast
                            on the half-hour, with music between. Newscasts during the regular
                            9-hour schedule consisted of 10 minutes on the hour.</p>
                        <p>On May 25, the Branch eliminated the 12:30 AM to 7:00 AM broadcasts to
                            the Dominican Republic, but continued with its regular normal 9-hour
                            broadcasts to Latin America and the 10:00 AM through 6:30 <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> direct broadcasts to the Dominican
                            Republic. The news patterns remained the same. The Branch continued to
                            broadcast 17½ hours per day until June 8 when it returned to its normal
                            schedule.</p>
                        <p>The Voice of America has not modified its broadcast schedule to Latin
                            America since June 8, 1965. It has continued to report developments in
                            the Dominican Republic, including the establishment of the Provisional
                            Government, in its regularly scheduled broadcasts.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>This will reply further to your letter of September 29, 1965, relative to
                            the distribution of printed propaganda by the Soviet Union, and our
                            assessment of the problem posed by these activities.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p><pb n="190" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_190"/>The Soviet Union has always put
                            a high value on the propaganda value of the printed word, and its
                            current efforts are voluminous and many-sided. It sends abroad a steady
                            flow of books, pamphlets, periodicals, in the languages of those in whom
                            it has an interest and can reach. This output is carefully directed to
                            reach the target groups that it considers politically important,
                            possibly vulnerable, or potentially influential, ranging from
                            influential leaders to children just learning to read. The messages vary
                            from explicit ideological indoctrination and argument to the subtler
                            message carried by harmless children’s tales and editions of Russian
                            classics: “We share with you a community of innocent human
                            interests.”</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union does not make public the total number of their books
                            actually exported. But production figures for last year show the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> published over 1,500 titles in about
                            45 million copies in languages not spoken inside its boundaries. A
                            considerable number of these, undoubtedly, were for educational and
                            training use within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Hence,
                            the statistics serve better as a guide to the pattern, direction, and
                            general dimensions of Soviet foreign book publishing than as exact
                            export figures.</p>
                        <p>The largest group of books—678 titles and some 35 million copies—is in
                            the general category of educational works, especially technical and
                            scientific textbooks. The Soviet program of producing scientific
                            textbooks for developing countries seems to be the most important of
                            their publishing efforts. A brochure recently published in India lists
                            about fifty textbooks from the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            dealing with science and technology. All but one of them are published
                            in English. We also have had reports that about 70 Soviet textbooks in
                            English are being sold in some parts of Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Announced Soviet book production in other broad categories is much
                            smaller. Books about and by the “founding fathers” of Marxism-Leninism
                            published last year numbered 126 titles, in something over a million
                            copies. Books about international affairs and foreign policy numbered 67
                            titles, in about three-quarters of a million copies. Belles-lettres<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">Works of literature that are considered works
                                of art, entertainment and culture, including novels, poetry, and
                                short stories.</note> accounted for 122 titles and almost a million
                            copies. Children’s books numbered over 1.2 million copies of 82
                            titles.</p>
                        <p>Because Soviet figures do not indicate exports and may not be complete,
                            these figures are not a certain or complete index of the scope of
                            emphasis of their book publishing for foreign consumption. Soviet
                            sources say that books produced by the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in foreign languages in other countries exceed
                            foreign-language output in the Soviet Union. <pb n="191" facs="0232" xml:id="pg_191"/>Figures are not available for recent years.
                            However, occasional figures revealed in the past suggest that
                            Soviet-sponsored books printed in other countries are at least double
                            the volume of titles and copies produced within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Periodicals published for circulation abroad form the other major Soviet
                            use of the weapon of print, and this effort has been expanding steadily.
                            Last year, 15 propaganda magazines were published in the Soviet Union,
                            in languages not spoken there. Some of these appeared in as many as 17
                            different language editions, with circulation totaling about 12 million.
                            These magazines are competently printed, and some are attractive in

                            German, Hindi, Japanese, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, and Urdu, as well as
                            Chinese, Hungarian, Korean, Mongolian, Rumanian, and Russian. Prestige
                            magazines have the largest circulation and broadest appeal, but the
                            specialized periodicals, carefully aimed at particular groups and
                            interests, bear the most explicit messages. <hi rend="italic">Soviet
                                Woman</hi> appears monthly in ten languages and <hi rend="italic">Sport in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss></hi> appears in
                            six. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Film</hi> appears monthly in Russian,
                            Arabic, French, German, and English. Recently, a Spanish edition was
                            added.</p>
                        <p>The languages and the targets vary with the shifting political interests
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. English, as an
                            international language, has shown a steady increase. Circulation of
                            periodicals in Indian languages increased six-fold in the last five
                            years, and Spanish has shown a marked upturn.</p>
                        <p>Soviet production does not tell anything like the whole story. It is
                            supplemented—and in fact surpassed—by three additional sources of
                            printed materials. One is the massive production of other Communist
                            countries, each with a sizeable output of its own—roughly 200
                            periodicals in all. Second is the output of international front groups,
                            such as the World Federation of Teachers quarterly publication, <hi rend="italic">Teachers of the World</hi>, in English, French,
                            German, and Spanish, or <hi rend="italic">Scientific World</hi>, a
                            review published in six languages by the World Federation of Scientific
                            Workers, London. And, third, at least three dozen periodicals—varying
                            greatly in regularity and distribution—are published outside the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> by Communist-front organizations, a
                            large number of them in Prague.</p>
                        <p>The export of Soviet periodicals is increased by the many magazines,
                            newspapers, and bulletins published in other countries by Soviet and
                            other Communist diplomatic missions and agencies. The Soviet news
                            agency, Novosti, which operates around the world, claims that it
                            publishes 26 magazines, 5 newspapers, and 64 press bulletins. These
                            magazines include <hi rend="italic">Soviet Life</hi> (formerly <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss></hi>),
                            published in this coun<pb n="192" facs="0233" xml:id="pg_192"/>try, and
                                <hi rend="italic">Soviet Land</hi>, published in India and Ceylon—in
                            15 languages and 300,000 copies per issue.</p>

                                Communist Countries in 1964</hi> are enclosed, since they provide
                            fuller discussion and detail.<note n="4" xml:id="d67fn4">Not attached

                        <p>The distribution system for Communist books and periodicals is as
                            extensive and elaborate as the production system. The Soviet book export
                            organization has contracts for the distribution of books and periodicals
                            with more than 800 firms in 68 countries. Books are shipped to retail
                            outlets on what amounts to a consignment basis, although the facade of a
                            normal export transaction is maintained. The distributor receives the
                            books postpaid at a 30 to 60 percent discount from the retail prices in
                            his catalogue. Terms of payment are extremely liberal and can be made in
                            local currency to local Soviet officials. Distributors who do not meet
                            their payments are apparently treated very gently. Funds accumulated
                            locally are used by the Soviets to finance local printing of additional
                            literature.</p>
                        <p>This system tends to frustrate government controls and to expand contacts
                            with local publishers and distributors. It conserves foreign exchange.
                            It can circumvent laws prohibiting the importation of propaganda—a bloc
                            country can sponsor the importation only of innocuous books, while
                            propaganda materials are printed within the target country, thus
                            avoiding local restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Supplementing this mechanism, local Communist parties have a substantial
                            role in distributing and advertising propaganda literature. In some
                            countries, only about ten percent of Communist literature is sold in
                            stores. The balance is distributed by Communist diplomatic, trade, and
                            cultural missions, street vendors, door-to-door salesmen, hawkers, and
                            local party organizations. These methods are employed especially in
                            under-developed areas, where there is a shortage of books and a large
                            supply of labor is available.</p>
                        <p>You asked how serious a problem is posed to the United States by the
                            Soviet Union’s exports of the printed word. Certainly, so massive a flow
                            of propaganda is a matter of serious concern. Though much of this
                            material may seem to us heavy-handed, difficult to credit, obviously
                            self-serving, and wearyingly monotonous, it would be unwise to
                            underestimate its effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Apart from sheer volume, a number of considerations make this a serious
                            problem. Much of this material sets forth, with single-minded intensity
                            and sometimes with skill and cunning, a doctrine implacably hostile to
                            the free society. It is persistent, flexible, and unscrupulous. <pb n="193" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_193"/>Much of it reaches an audience
                            without the experience or resources to make objective judgments on the
                            “evidence” and arguments Communism presents.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important of all, among the developing and modernizing
                            societies, there is a vast hunger for the printed word (for books, for
                            magazines, for anything) that will feed the hunger for knowledge, for
                            know-how, for the texts from which these peoples hope to learn how to
                            fulfill their new hopes and aspirations. The peoples seeking to
                            modernize their societies look for short-cuts.</p>
                        <p>We cannot seek to make the official segment of our output match the
                            Soviet Union’s in extent, to make all—or even much—of the print we send
                            abroad carry a controlled and calculated message. We cannot discipline,
                            censor, direct, and focus. As a free society, we must allow our national
                            life, insofar as it is reflected in the words that go overseas, to make
                            its own impact. Although its diversity means the inclusion of some
                            materials damaging to us, its obvious freedom from control, its enormous
                            variety and liveliness, will on balance speak more eloquently and
                            effectively for the cause of freedom than all the disciplined words that
                            make their concerted assault in the Communist cause.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s publications are part of that
                            reflection of our national life. They aim to tell our story to audiences
                            that would not automatically be reached, or not be reached in time. They
                            aim to explain or clarify what has been muddied or distorted by
                            accident, misunderstanding, or hostility. We seek to fill gaps, within
                            the limits of our means, and to supply the urgently needed information
                            that is not available through the normal exporting of American
                            publications. To do this, is a demanding and difficult responsibility,
                            and one that grows as the world hunger for information grows. Hunger for
                            information tends to increase as it is fed—fed not only by the printed
                            word, but by all the channels of communication opened by the wonders of
                            modern technology and the world’s increasing interdependence.</p>
                        <p>In regard to your question about the sale of printing equipment to the
                            Soviet Union, I do not think that the Soviet Union’s printed propaganda
                            effort is currently impeded significantly by lack of advanced or
                            sophisticated equipment. It is probable that for most of the audiences
                            they reach, the technical level of their production is adequate—and may
                            even seem impressive. They themselves have provided printing equipment
                            and training to some countries. It is probable that distribution of
                            material, rather than access to more refined, economical, or efficient
                            processes and equipment, is the problem most concerning them. You are
                            aware, of course, that the Soviets have arrangements with indigenous
                            publishers in many countries.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government, for reasons of national security, prohibits
                            the export of strategic goods and technology to the Soviet <pb n="194" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_194"/>Union and other Communist countries of
                            Eastern Europe. I have been informed that no American-made printing
                            equipment which was clearly destined to be used in the international
                            propaganda efforts of the Soviet Union has been licensed for export to
                            the Soviet Union. In fact, in 1961 the Department of Commerce denied an
                            export license application to sell printing equipment to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> which would have been used to print
                            foreign language publications. Since that time there have been no export
                            license applications submitted for the sale of printing equipment of
                            that type. However, we understand that export license applications have
                            been approved by the Department of Commerce for the sale of equipment to
                            be used in the printing of Russian-language publications which circulate
                            primarily within the Soviet Union.</p>

                            determined in various revolutionary ways to change this condition,
                            economic development is a critical determinant in U.S. foreign policy,

                                Peace.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">Food for Peace, also known as
                                PL–480, was an act passed in 1954 that permitted the President to
                                order the shipment of commodities to U.S. allies on concessional or
                                grant terms and authorized the U.S. Government to donate commodities
                                to religious and voluntary organizations for humanitarian
                                purposes.</note></p>
                        <p>In clusters of countries, a public conviction of economic progress being
                            made is the factor that assures the nature of the governments and the
                            political order of nations. There, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has taken major steps, such as appointing senior
                            officers whose only activity is the effective spread of information on
                            the U.S. aid effort. Four such men are assigned in the Near East and
                            South Asia, six in South-East Asia, seven in Latin America. A large
                            number of information officers work most of their time at it.</p>
                        <p>Support of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> is by and large a
                            localized operation, performed in the field at the initiative of men on
                            the scene in response to specific projects and problems. Nevertheless,
                            the centralized effort is still very large. The latter comprises the
                            films, <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> programs, pamphlets, features,
                            packets, books, various analyses and daily news stories distributed from
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Washington, either on a
                            regional basis or on a world-wide basis.</p>
                        <p>All major developments related to <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            are reported in the news, world-wide if of sufficient significance, or
                            regionally. This work most heavily bears on the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and its counterpart in print, <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss>, the press service. Supplementing their news is a
                            continuous production of secondary materials, scripts and program series
                            in the case of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, features and
                            analyses by <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss>.</p>

                            series on “Modernization Around the World.” Unexceptional, but
                            illustrative of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s specially
                            targeted productions, are signing ceremonies for new <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> agreements and swearing-in ceremonies

                            recorded for broadcast to countries concerned; dedication and
                            presentation ceremonies in the field are taped for broadcast from
                            Washington; interviews with hundreds of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> grantees visiting the U.S. are recorded for incor<pb n="196" facs="0237" xml:id="pg_196"/>poration in targeted programs,

                            1964 for progress pictures. Twenty-four picture stories resulted, plus

                            a miscellany of bookmarks, rulers, pennants with slogans, 50,000 bus

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Need for confidence in the U.S.</hi>—a strong common
                            thread throughout, with variations by area, e.g., questioning of
                            American reliability and quality of leadership (in Western Europe); a
                            heritage of resentment accentuated by fears that the U.S. may be
                            returning to old patterns of unilateral intervention (in Latin America);
                            suspicion of the U.S. and skepticism as to the value of collaborating
                            with the West (in Africa). The need for deeper understanding as the
                            necessary basis for confidence and cooperation is almost universally
                            reported.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The communist challenge</hi>—not only direct threats
                            of communist subversion, but also the ideological appeal of Marxism (on
                            Soviet, Chinese, Castroite or other model) as the wave of the future.
                            While particularly strong in some of the developing areas, this appeal
                            is likewise cited among influential intellectual circles in more
                            sophisticated and stable countries.</p>

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Internal weaknesses and instability</hi>—lack of

                            social development, of moving traditional societies into the modern era.
                            Psychological problems are manifold, such as frustrations caused by the
                            “revolution of rising expectations”; lack of national unity and
                            identification; the “search for dignity”. These are mentioned most often
                            in the developing areas, but by no means exclusively: e.g., Rome cites
                            lack of strength of democratic institutions as the basic problem for the
                            U.S. in Italy.</p>

                            (e.g., hatred of “imperialists” in ex-colonial countries) which color
                            all thinking and limit receptivity to fact and reason; the problem of

                            and outlook so different from ours (mentioned particularly in Africa).
                            Some <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s point out that the process
                            of education is gradual and changing fundamental attitudes takes

                            potential is highly limited for the present. In Eastern Europe the aim
                            is sometimes expressed as “ventilating closed societies”. In certain
                            situations, we can do little more than open doors, bring in Western
                            ideas, and begin to talk. In others, the dialogue and introduction of
                            ideas serves as the basis for more directed actions.</p>

                            figures in several programs, with emphasis on strengthening national

                            attitudes on economic issues, such as the need for socially-controlled
                            private enterprise. In Eastern Europe, nudging the regimes toward

                        </list>
                        <p>The Soviet and Eastern European press and other public media are
                            currently revealing clear evidence of concern on the part of the
                            Communist leadership at the impact of Western propaganda on their
                            peoples. American propaganda, especially, is singled out for analysis
                            and attack and youth is indicated as the age group which has succumbed
                            most to it.</p>
                        <p>The concern is revealed in a coordinated program of ideological
                            indoctrination which features an expose of what is termed “the Western
                            ideological offensive.” This “offensive” is alleged to be coordinated
                                <pb n="202" facs="0243" xml:id="pg_202"/>through a “special office
                            in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.” The American effort is
                            largely attributed to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and to its
                            “close associate”, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, which is said
                            to play the major overt role. The ideological indoctrination effort
                            itself is marshalled under the slogan, “The Leninist principle of
                            peaceful coexistence does not permit coexistence in the sphere of
                            ideology.” Many of the articles, which are very similar in content and
                            direction, give statistical information on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s budget and personnel. Their attacks extend to all of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media.</p>
                        <p>Some examples are:</p>

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Nova Mysl</hi>, a Czechoslovak Communist Party
                            publication, also laments the effectiveness of the <hi rend="italic">appeal of Western propaganda to the youth.</hi> In attacking
                            Western radio broadcasts, the article states: “The enemy . . . knows
                            that young people like music, especially hot music. Therefore, he sets
                            about influencing young people with the help of music, attracting them
                            to foreign broadcasts and leading them away from public and political
                            life.”</p>
                        <p>3. A Hungarian daily from the county of Nograd also attacks <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and RFE <hi rend="italic">use of music
                                to appeal to the youth</hi> and to entice them into listening to the

                            programs. It says that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has, “. .
                            . in 106 countries, 239 independent offices, 182 libraries, 79 reading

                        <p>4. The new Hungarian youth magazine, <hi rend="italic">Ifusagi

                            of the news items will also appeal. We must exert an emotional,

                            those layers which they deem the most receptive. The United States

                            of special significance. . . . The objectives of these inquiries are

                                Wolnosci</hi> of January 5, 1966, General Gregorz Korczynski states:

                            also provide a clue to what we are up against in trying to move ahead on

                            the reason why cultural-exchange events could not be agreed to, was more
                            a pretext than the real motivation. The recent increase in published
                            evidence of Communist concern at the effectiveness of Western

                        <p>I would like to outline briefly the problems which we face in Viet Nam in
                            disseminating information on U.S. participation in the existing
                            conflict. The following represents a summary of the principal issues
                            which I have noted from my review of world press and study of reports
                            received from our various field posts:</p>
                        <p>1. There is an uncertainty about the convictions of the Vietnamese people
                            in prosecuting the present war.</p>
                        <p>2. There is an uncertainty about the character of the present leadership
                            of South Viet Nam—whether or not it is a genuine government or a
                            military clique—whether it is a principal in the war or an adjunct of
                            U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>3. There are doubts about the support which Hanoi has given to the Viet
                            Cong, about whether the <gloss target="#t_PAVN_1">PAVN</gloss> is on the
                            scene in South Viet Nam and about which side was responsible for the
                            escalation of the war.</p>
                        <p>4. There is confusion over the U.S. attitude toward the Geneva Agreements
                            of 1954 and 1962, about the role we played in the Geneva Conferences and
                            about our acceptance of these Agreements as a basis for
                                negotiations.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Reference is to the Geneva
                                Conference, which took place between April 26 and July 20, 1954. The
                                following countries participated: the United States, the United
                                Kingdom, France, the People’s Republic of China, Laos, the Soviet
                                Union, and the representatives of what would become South Vietnam
                                and North Vietnam. The Geneva Agreement of July 21, 1954, commonly
                                known as the Geneva Accords, was negotiated during the Geneva
                                Conference and brought about the cessation of hostilities between
                                the Viet Minh and France. Some of the key provisions of the Accord
                                included the establishment of a boundary line along the 17th
                                parallel, which divided Vietnam in two as north and south entities;
                                a call for Communist Viet Minh forces, and their civilian
                                sympathizers, to be above the 17th parallel and French and
                                anti-Communist Vietnamese to be below it; and a mandate for national
                                elections in Vietnam, under international supervision, in 1956. For
                                additional information regarding United States policy and the Geneva
                                Conference and 1954 Accords, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2#d802"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1952–1954, vol.

                                of 1962 brought to a close the hostilities between left- and
                                right-wing factions in Laos and called for the country to become
                                neutral and for the formation of a tripartite government that
                                represented the conflicting factions.</note></p>
                        <p>5. Doubts have been expressed on whether we want the United Nations to
                            play a major role in negotiations for settlement of the Vietnamese war,
                            or whether we merely want it to support us in our efforts to arrive at
                            the conference table.</p>
                        <p><pb n="206" facs="0247" xml:id="pg_206"/>6. There is uncertainty about
                            our long term attitude toward Southeast Asia and whether we are seeking
                            peace, the establishment of independent countries, area social and
                            economic developments, or a base for anti-communist activities on this
                            continent.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">None of these doubts, uncertainties or ambiguities are
                                justified</hi>. However, they represent practical problems with
                            which the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must deal in telling

                        <p>To meet these problems, I plan the following:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">In the event of a continuation of the peace campaign

                        <p>1. We will arrange for interviews of world leaders who are conspicuous in
                            the search for peace and whose views will be significant in influencing
                            world opinion. These interviews will be carried over the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, presented on film, over television,
                            in newsreels, and texts distributed to the press.</p>
                        <p>2. We will prepare a written record showing the history of U.S.
                            initiatives through private and diplomatic channels to reach a peaceful
                            settlement. Pamphlets will be prepared with a chronology of events,
                            photographs and significant exhibits from speeches by you, Secretary

                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>3. We will increase substantially through all media our coverage of the
                            U.S. efforts to develop South Viet Nam socially and politically. I
                            intend to stimulate an increase in the visits of foreign correspondents
                            to Viet Nam, to distribute additional written and film material and to
                            have documentaries and interviews carried on the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>. In this connection, I have conferred
                            with Secretary of Agriculture <persName corresp="#p_FOL_1">Freeman</persName> about press coverage on his proposed trip to

                            as well as the general diplomacy surrounding the war. I recognize that
                            all interested agencies support this view and I have instructed our
                            staff to constantly keep this point in mind.</p>
                        <p>4. I intend to increase our film production on the non-military aspects
                            of our assistance to South Viet Nam. We need the counterpart of “The

                                a film produced by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and

                        <p>1. Publicizing our commitment to the economic development to Viet Nam
                            (North as well as South) through the Asian Development Bank and other
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>2. The U.S. objectives for the ultimate non-alignment of Viet Nam and the

                            propose the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Publicizing your statements and those of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> and others that the search for
                            peace will continue.</p>
                        <p>2. An emphasis upon all previous initiatives towards peace, private as
                            well as public.</p>
                        <p>3. Preparation of documentary evidence of <gloss target="#t_PAVN_1">PAVN</gloss> infiltration into South Viet Nam, showing the number
                            of regiments and military equipment. South Vietnamese spokesmen can be
                            used to document these facts by disclosing evidence offered by captured
                            soldiers, pictures of equipment that has been confiscated, and similar
                            material.</p>
                        <p>4. Stressing the criteria for bombing North Viet Nam targets—the military
                            nature of these targets and the efforts to avoid injury to
                            civilians.</p>
                        <p>5. We would also publicize the activities of the Viet Cong, the damage
                            and death that it has caused and the terrorist activities directed to
                            the civilian population.</p>
                        <p><pb n="208" facs="0249" xml:id="pg_208"/>These programs will be most
                            effective if we have time to plan them and to carry them out with the
                            complete cooperation of all other interested agencies. I have received
                            this cooperation in the past.</p>
                        <p>At this time I would also like to suggest that you consider taking the
                            following steps in the event that bombing is resumed in North Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>1. Either you or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>
                            should issue a public statement repeating the many offers to meet at the
                            conference table at any time with any person to discuss a resolution of
                            the conflict. A channel of communication for this purpose should be
                            named publicly to avoid any argument that the offer is “window
                            dressing.”</p>
                        <p>2. You might also wish to consider the desirability of having Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goldberg</persName> present at the
                            United Nations a proposal that the Geneva Conference powers, or a group
                            of them, be asked to meet again to review the Geneva Agreements. When
                            that proposal is presented, the U.S. can pledge to adherence to the
                            Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962.</p>

                            out that our objectives in South Vietnam are being misunderstood in the
                            Far East and urges that we take certain specific steps to show people in
                            the Far East that we in the United States are united as a nation, that
                            we are not waging a racist war, and that our intentions in Asia are
                                honorable.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">An unknown hand underlined the

                        <p>Here are some of the specific suggestions which he has made:</p>
                        <p>Demonstrate once again to Asians that the United States is made up of
                            people of many races and backgrounds. Senators Dan <persName corresp="#p_IDK_1">Inouye</persName> and Hiram <persName corresp="#p_FHL_1">Fong</persName>, Congressman Spark <persName corresp="#p_MSM_1">Matsunaga</persName> and Congresswoman Patsy

                            described above . . . (national unity). They might also be joined by
                            some of our outstanding Negro congressmen. Their visits should be
                            concerned less with meeting government officials than with calls on
                            universities, business and industrial leaders, labor leaders, sessions
                            with opposition political leaders, newspaper editors, municipal and
                            provincial legislators, religious leaders, etc. Being seen and heard
                            would be sufficient; they wouldn’t necessarily have to say a word about
                            Vietnam to serve the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Capitalize on the national interests of the various Asian peoples in the
                            fields of sports, music and arts as a means of reaching the common
                            people with the non-political but nonetheless very important message
                            that Americans are nice people. The Japanese, for example, are rabid
                            baseball fans; a series of baseball clinics conducted around <pb n="210" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_210"/>Japan by athletes like <persName corresp="#p_MWH_1">Willie Mays</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WM_1">Maury Wills</persName> and other Negro athletes
                            whose names are household words in that country would expose them to the

                            admiration of millions. Korea is a great country for track and field;
                            Taiwan has hundreds of outdoor basketball courts; Thais are rabid boxing
                            enthusiasts and someone like <persName corresp="#p_PF_1">Floyd
                                Patterson</persName> would be greeted like a hero. The possibilities
                            are endless.<note n="6" xml:id="d72fn6">An unknown hand drew a bracket

                        <p>A similar program of good will and favorable exposure of Americans could
                            be carried out with musicians and artists. Not long ago the University
                            of Denver jazz band toured the Far East and made friends wherever they
                            went. Projects such as this ought to be expanded. Imagine the reception
                            that a sparkling Nisei<note n="7" xml:id="d72fn7">Reference is to the

                            she could be sent out to show Indonesians or Malaysians in a subtle,
                            soft-sell manner that Americans are nice people and come in a variety of
                            sizes and colors.</p>
                        <p>Re-export, if only temporarily, some of the skills and talents
                            contributed to the American melting pot by the offspring of Asian
                            immigrants. I have in mind such men as <persName corresp="#p_YM_1">Minoru Yamasaki</persName> of Detroit, one of America’s outstanding
                            architects, who might be persuaded to travel through Asia talking to
                            builders and developers about the architecture of a reawakening Asia. I
                            am also thinking of Baron Goto, vice-chancellor of the East-West Center
                            in Honolulu, already well-known throughout Asia, who is extremely versed
                            in Asian agricultural problems. Of District Judge John Aiso of Los
                            Angeles who can reach the legal profession. Of the <persName corresp="#p_KE_1">Koda</persName> brothers who grow more rice in
                            Central California than many Asian provinces. While all these men are
                            Japanese-Americans, I am sure there are persons of comparable stature
                            among the Chinese-Americans, Korean-Americans and Filipino-Americans,
                            all capable of helping to bury the myth that the United States is an
                            Anglo-Saxon nation waging a racist war in Asia, and expressing our
                            interest in the welfare and progress of the people of Asia.</p>
                        <p>I would indeed appreciate your reaction to these views.</p>

                                        reviewed several <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>’
                                        summaries of their activities and programs, which were
                                        referred to in the January 7 memorandum he received from
                                            <persName corresp="#p_WBM_1">White</persName> (see <ref target="#d69">Document 69</ref>), and subsequently
                                        shared his thoughts with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s Area and Media Directors in this January
                                        19 memorandum. He offered three conclusions for the
                                        Directors to consider:</p>
                                    <p>“(1) Almost everywhere we say that our chief audience is
                                        leaders, yet our programs are not sufficiently directed
                                        toward them, nor are our techniques for identifying and
                                        keeping in touch with them as good as they should be.</p>
                                    <p>“(2) Personal contact is accepted as our most effective
                                        medium, yet the nature of our programs is such that we do
                                        too little of it. Adding American personnel may be the
                                        answer in some cases but not in most; solutions must be
                                        found in the workload of the posts.</p>
                                    <p>“(3) While most <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>
                                        maintain that they have cut out peripheral activities, there
                                        is much evidence to the contrary, including inspection
                                        reports. <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> need more
                                        help in identifying these activities and in managing their
                                        workloads.”</p>
                                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> concluded the
                                        memorandum by requesting that the Directors of each area
                                        “summarize for me replies that have been received from its
                                        posts.” (Ibid.)</p></note></item>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Major politico-psychological problems</hi>—Our major
                            problems stem from Chinese Communist and North Vietnamese overt and
                            covert pressures against the independent nations of the Far East. Not
                            only must we provide material exposing the dangers of these activities
                            but we must also convince our audiences of our determination and ability
                            to fulfill our military and economic commitments in the face of this
                            growing menace.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Program
                                Objectives</hi>—In all cases, Country Plans are based upon the
                            latest available statements of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            policy. Each <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> country program,
                            therefore, reflects the demands of the particular country situation. In
                            all cases, however, the image of American strength, reliability and
                            friendship is basic to our objectives.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Media Techniques</hi>—Effectiveness and usefulness
                            of media techniques depend upon the audience and message. In all
                            countries, personal contact is necessary in order to establish a
                            receptivity to or <pb n="212" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_212"/>awareness of
                            a particular media product and is needed to gauge the value of all our
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Target Audiences</hi>—In almost every country of the
                            area, our programs are directed at elite groups: government officials,
                            university and high school teachers, media representatives, top-level
                            business executives. Rural, mass audiences are also our target in
                            Viet-Nam, Laos and Thailand where there are active counter-insurgency
                            programs. In these countries we concentrate on training the information
                            services of the host government and assisting its programs for
                            establishing greater national unity. In most programs, however, budget
                            stringencies make it impossible to carry out meaningful, mass
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Peripheral Activities Eliminated</hi>—Cutbacks have
                            been made by some posts in the variety of publications and radio
                            programs distributed. In countries such as Burma, Indonesia and
                            Cambodia, cuts were made at the request of the host governments. At all
                            posts, steadily rising fixed costs make it difficult to maintain the
                            effectiveness of current programs without budget increases.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Larger Budget, Manpower</hi>—In almost every case,
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> could use larger staffs to
                            capitalize on personal contact. Related to this is their view that new
                            libraries and information centers can help the Post reach important
                            segments of the population which at present receive minimal attention.
                            They point out that fixed costs are usually eighty percent of their
                            budgets and that added program money could increase the effectiveness of
                            present staffs.</p>

                        <p>Here are some general impressions I have formed after three months in
                            this assignment, including a month-long field trip.</p>
                        <p>A.1. Many of our posts get locked into mechanisms and the general
                            apparatus of the Agency; too many of our <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s lack a sufficient sense of detachment to enable them
                            to cut out marginal activities or those which have outlived their
                            usefulness; and, worse, we don’t often enough reshape a total program
                            effort to new political and/or psychological situations.</p>
                        <p>2. The entire Agency—in Washington and in the field—would benefit by a
                            reduction in total output. “The more the better” just ain’t true in this
                            business; “more” is apt to further diffuse what should be a highly
                            concentrated effort directed toward very specific audiences.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> generally pay too little
                            attention to material produced at the regional centers. It’s easy to
                            incorporate this material into a program; just as easy to let it keep
                            coming in without regular review of its value to a given program.</p>
                        <p>4. We’ve all got to be a lot tougher in our attitude toward taking on
                            additional program activities. Otherwise we wind up with diffuse,
                            activity oriented rather than tight, policy oriented programs.</p>
                        <p>These four concerns could best be attacked by more old-fashioned bossism
                            by Area Directors and the front office. I think we engage in too many
                            lengthy exchanges with the field over given program questions and ought,
                            instead, to make a decision to cut, reduce, sharpen or improve and then
                            make that decision stick.</p>
                        <p>B. There are three problems on which I feel the necessity for
                            clarification here in Washington. I’m uncomfortable with the fact that
                            our <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> have varying views on these
                            items, which are basic:</p>
                        <p>1. The purpose of English Teaching by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, regarded by some as an end in itself and by others
                            (myself included) as a means to <pb n="214" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_214"/>drawing appropriate target audiences into our program orbit. The one
                            modification to this, I believe, is English Teaching in the bi-national
                                centers.<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">Reference is to independent,
                                foreign institutions that served to promote mutual understanding
                                between the United States and the host nation and generally worked
                                closely with <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> offices,
                                particularly in the area of English language teaching.</note> In
                            this case English Teaching is a primary source of revenue. Even here,
                            however, every effort should be made to attract target groups and then
                            fill out the classes as necessary.</p>
                        <p>2. A lot of our programs keep requesting “how-to-do-it” materials and it
                            is my judgement that this crosses into <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s province. This isn’t a question of bureaucratic
                            line-drawing; it’s a question of the function and purpose of an
                            information agency. Here again I’d like to see a clear statement
                            prepared for the field.</p>
                        <p>3. In my area, over the past few years, some bi-national centers have
                            been closed and we’ve markedly reduced our support of others. Although
                            there’s no one clear rule, it is my general impression that the less our
                            support of any center, the weaker our control and the more likely that
                            the center will not play its appropriate role. So, generally, what’s the
                            Agency’s position vis-á-vis support—more or less?</p>
                        <p>C. Here’s a long-range concern: to the extent that our field operations
                            are split into several buildings, to that extent is effectiveness
                            diminished. When and as possible, we should work toward physically
                            unified programs.</p>
                        <p>D. Finally, the most difficult problem and one which I think deserves a
                            discussion with all Area and Media Directors. I am convinced that we are
                            not communicating effectively with the intellectual community in much of
                            our area. This is due in part to the semantic “gap” (basically, the
                            different meaning applied to the terms socialism and capitalism, and the
                            various sub-terms that flow from these); in part to official statements
                            that leave unclear our position concerning private versus public sector
                            enterprises (we <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>, too often, like we’re only
                            for private sector development); partly because we seem to be critical
                            about revolutionary strains in our own society (we’re so defensive about
                            kids in the SDS, SNCC, etc.); partly because our elite audience
                            occasionally wants us to be against governments elected by a majority
                            but which are status quo governments (an impossible position for us to
                            take). Whatever the reasons, we’re not in effective communication <pb n="215" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_215"/>and I’d like to see a
                            discussion with appropriate people to see if others feel the problem and
                            also to make some suggestions of my own.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">An

                            provides justification for one of the basic tenets of our policy in

                        <p>We have long maintained that our efforts directed toward the “satellite”
                            countries of Eastern Europe are not only important for their impact upon
                            the peoples of these countries but equally so for their pass-on impact
                            upon the Soviet Union. A belated discovery that the Soviet citizen
                            wastes 70 percent of his leisure time because of badly organized service
                            industries has caused <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> to advise Soviet
                            planners to emulate the experience of the other countries of Communist
                                <pb n="216" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_216"/>Eastern Europe. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> points, for example, to the efficiency of
                            the supermarkets like the Polish “Super Sam” which first came into being
                            after we had displayed such a store at our exhibit in Poznan in
                                1958.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">Reference is to the city in Poland

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> may in fact be rushing us a bit. One of the
                            major objectives of our Trade Fair exhibits in Eastern Europe this year
                            is to encourage the spread of small, privately owned service shops.
                            While we have been moving in this direction for several years, added
                            impetus was provided earlier this year by Polish authorities who
                            expressly asked that we show some of the machinery used in our service
                            and repair shops. As with the supermarket, we are hopeful that a seed
                            planted in the “satellite” countries will nurture fruit in the Soviet
                            Union also.</p>
                        <p>There are other examples of this pass-on impact, the most obvious being
                            the widespread popularity of American popular and dance music which
                            spreads like wildfire from the Western borders of the Communist bloc to
                            the East. <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi>’s recognition of this comes
                            late, but is interesting, nevertheless.</p>

                        <p>In recruiting American participants for the Far East exchange program, as
                            well as for other areas of the world, it has been our practice
                            constantly to seek to reflect the multiracial character of our society.
                            In fact, if we proceed on the principle of asking the outstanding people
                            in their fields, the multiracial character of our society is almost
                            automatically reflected, since we happen to have a society in which
                            people with ability rise to the top, no matter what their origins. Thus,
                            in recent years we have sent the following persons abroad:</p>

                        <p>As an indication of our continued concern to give a multi-racial content
                            to our cultural features, we have under active consideration for
                            presentation such integrated groups as the Cornell University Glee Club,
                            the Charlie Byrd Trio, the Northwestern Saxophone Quartette, and the
                            Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Among outstanding Negroes who recently
                            have responded affirmatively to our solicitations are: <persName corresp="#p_WJR_1">John Wheeler</persName>, President, Mechanics and
                            Farmers Bank, Durham, North Carolina; Harry H.C. Gibson, Vice-President
                            and General Counsel for the Supreme Life Insurance Company, Chicago, and

                            University.</p>
                        <p>For reasons of policy, members of Congress are not funded through the
                            exchange program because of the partisan issue, but we encourage their
                            trips. We are not, however, under such limitation in the selection of
                            officials at the state and local levels.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, popular personalities such as Miss <persName corresp="#p_SC_1">Pat Suzuki</persName> have ample opportunity
                            through commercial channels for appearances in Asia. And World Series

                            may know, have been visiting Japan for years under such auspices.</p>
                        <p>Among other persons mentioned by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HP_1">Hoyt</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_YM_1">Minoru

                            with a technical and developmental field and are thus beyond the normal

                        <p>As funds and other priorities permit, we shall certainly consider the

                        <p>The purpose of the coverage effort is to increase the flow abroad of
                            information media materials on specific themes through three major
                            channels: (1) from <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> to
                            targeted <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts, (2) from <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> for processing and output to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts, and (3) from the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_PsyWar_1">PsyWar</gloss> and foreign ministries to
                            Vietnamese diplomatic missions abroad, with <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> support
                            and guidance.</p>
                        <p>The list of specific themes involved is flexible and can be adapted or
                            increased as conditions change. At the start of the accelerated effort,
                            they are (1) evidence of infiltration of regular NVN military units and
                            bloc weapons from the North, (2) evidence that the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>’s political structure is tied to Hanoi
                            and has no basis of popular support in the South, (3) evidence of humane
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> treatment of <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> and NVN prisoners, (4) the pacification
                            (rural construction) program, (5) evidence of political stability and
                            democratization progress, (6) economic and social progress, and (7) Free
                            World (including U.S.) assistance, especially in non-military and civic
                            action fields.</p>
                        <p>The urgency of the need for the accelerated effort was so great that in
                            the three weeks since it started, the required reorganization of staff
                            and material resources has been carried on simultaneously with actual
                            coverage operations.</p>
                        <p>The basic reorganization of resources involved (1) the formation of a
                            mobile coverage team capable of moving out on short notice to gather
                            materials for all media without disrupting on-going programs; (2) the
                            adjustment of media processing facilities in Saigon to give priority
                            handling to the materials gathered; and (3) the allocation of material
                            resources to support both the team and the media processing
                            services.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Coverage Team</hi>. The field coverage team consists
                            of an American Field Manager, Press Reporter, Combat Photographer and
                            Economics Reporter, and Vietnamese Radio Reporter and <gloss target="#t_Mopix_1">Mopix</gloss> Photographer. Its composition may
                            vary according to the assignment, and can be reinforced from the media
                            sections as needed.</p>

                            the increased flow of materials abroad. These include: a contract with
                            the National Motion Picture Center for priority processing of film;<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">Reference is to the Government of South

                            production; a shift of all but news photo processing from the Press

                            of materials produced for one medium to other media for adaptation.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Material Resources</hi>. For the most part, the
                            resources needed for this accelerated effort are being acquired.
                            Arrangements for military air transportation to the field are
                            functioning. A vehicle for fast coverages within the Saigon-Gia Dinh
                            area is not yet available. Office space for a team headquarters has been
                            allocated, and field media equipment has been furnished by the media
                            sections. For the most part, personnel requirements have been met. The
                            reassignment of the Press Officer without an immediate replacement has
                            created a serious temporary shortage in the Press side of the operation,
                            but the arrival of the special <gloss target="#t_IPS_1">IPS</gloss>
                            coverage team will help alleviate this problem.</p>

                            daily. A number of pamphlets created earlier are in process of

                        <p>1. How can the <gloss target="#t_PsyWar_1">PsyWar</gloss> Ministry create
                            a stronger International Information Program? The need is for more and
                            better production of media materials designed for output through <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> diplomatic missions abroad. At
                            present, the Ministry gives this program too low priority, and has
                            assigned inadequate staff.</p>
                        <p>2. Looking ahead, can the Ministry give assurance of a balanced film
                            production at the National Motion Picture Center? At present, the
                            Center’s resources are largely consumed in production for television. It
                            should not neglect the continuing need for films and film processing for
                            distribution at home and abroad.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE OTHER WAR IN VIET-NAM</p>
                        <p>The story today in Viet-Nam is one of war. Radio and television, the
                            headlines and front pages of our newspapers tell us daily of American
                            forces—in support of our gallant Vietnamese allies—fighting countless
                            deadly engagements in delta swamps, in dense jungles, over rugged
                            mountainous terrain. The horizon of every American’s concern has <pb n="222" facs="0263" xml:id="pg_222"/>been extended to remote places
                            with unfamiliar names—the Iadrang river valley, Binhdinh province,
                            Chulai, Danang.</p>
                        <p>But there is another war being fought at the same time, and in the same
                            country, that the American people know little about. It is the struggle
                            for the minds and hearts of the Vietnamese people, and it is just as
                            crucial in its final import as is the military effort. For this other
                            war is a confrontation of concepts—those of freedom versus those of
                            coercion.</p>
                        <p>In that struggle the whole matter of communications—communication among
                            the people, and between the people and their government—is of vital
                            importance. Let me tell you something about it.</p>
                        <p>Slow, low-flying airplanes drop millions of leaflets asking:</p>
                        <quote><p>“Why do the Viet Cong kill innocent, unarmed people?</p>
                            <p>“Why are the Viet Cong rice taxes so very high?</p>
                            <p>“Why do the Viet Cong force the people to labor at gun
                            point?”</p></quote>
                        <p>Hovering helicopters relay recorded appeals to Viet Cong guerrillas from
                            their wives and sweethearts to lay down arms and come home.</p>
                        <p>Traveling drama troupes—an ancient Vietnamese custom—bring entertainment
                            to the hamlets as well as a kind of “commercial”, for they also speak
                            out the story of attack and subversion from the North and of valiant
                            resistance in the South.</p>
                        <p>Newly established provincial newspapers, national radio—and now
                            television, posters and photo exhibits—set forth the Saigon Government’s
                            efforts to build and to protect a free, prosperous and peaceful
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>Offers to welcome back Viet Cong to the Government side <hi rend="italic">chieu hoi</hi>—“with open arms”—have been even floated down rivers
                            on banana tree rafts to enemy-held territory.</p>
                        <p>The North Vietnamese are informed by air leaflet drops of the facts of
                            their regime’s aggression, of the reasons for our limited bombings. The
                            leaflets make clear that it is the communist party of North Viet-Nam
                            which is our enemy, not the people. Gift packages of clothing and toys
                            are dropped addressed to the children of the North from the young people
                            of the South.</p>
                        <p>South Vietnamese Government information teams are spread out over the
                            countryside talking to the people face-to-face. They tell of the real
                            goal of the Viet Cong—conquest, directed and supported by outside
                            communist forces. They tell of the opportunities of freedom, of
                            independence, and of rising levels of life possible with the end of
                            communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>These are a few examples of the psychological and informational
                            operations in the field of human communication being carried out with
                                <pb n="223" facs="0264" xml:id="pg_223"/>vigor and ingenuity by the

                            country.</p>
                        <p>Recognition of the critical importance of the psychological front and the
                            necessity of a coordinated American approach was signaled in May, 1965,

                            and technical advice to the Government of Viet-Nam. The U.S. military
                            assigned carefully selected military officers to <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>, and the Department of State

                        <p>I know that all of you here today are interested particularly in the
                            fields of television and radio. In the past few days television has come
                            to Viet-Nam. It is yet another means of establishing sound, reliable and
                            continuing communications between the Government and the people and its
                            immediacy and visual impact make it a potentially powerful and effective
                            medium in a country of wide regional and local differences to inform, to
                            educate, to unify. At the same time this television capacity will be
                            used to inform and to entertain our own forces stationed there.</p>
                        <p>We have also helped the Vietnamese to develop their own radio capability
                            in many directions. We advise and assist the Vietnamese Broadcasting
                            Corporation and the Vietnamese Defense Ministry’s <hi rend="italic">Voice of Freedom</hi>. We are training Vietnamese in program
                            production, station and network management and administration, and
                            central and regional programming.</p>

                            radio network—broadcasts to South and North Viet-Nam six and one-half
                            hours daily in Vietnamese. In the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            transmitting and relay complex is a 50,000 watt, medium-wave relay

                            Viet-Nam. Incidentally, this installation must be an audio thorn in the
                            side of the communists since they have shelled it several times over the
                            past year and a half and our personnel there have found it prudent to
                            carry out their duties wearing side arms.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> is perhaps the most unusual
                            development in U.S. overseas information activities since the

                        <p>The nerve ends of this entire operation are those valiant and valuable

                            basic mission to move among the people, they must often do so in the
                            sinister shadow of the Viet Cong presence. The danger is real. For
                            instance, I can tell you that only a few days ago—on February 4—one of
                            our own Vietnamese staff members, and four employees of the Vietnamese
                                <pb n="225" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_225"/>Information Service, were
                            ambushed and murdered by the enemy. Frequently far from home base, our
                            representatives’ success in cooperative operations with their Vietnamese
                            Information Service colleagues singularly depends upon their own
                            reservoirs of judgment, ingenuity—and courage.</p>
                        <p>Naturally such an intrepid corps develops its own legends. I have heard
                            many. For instance, often our men in the field have to improvise.
                            Because of higher priorities, air leaflet drops have been known to be
                            cancelled. Some of our representatives at times have taken to hand
                            delivering up to 10,000 leaflets from light L–19 observation planes
                            simply by leaning out the side windows and letting fly. As a result a
                            new occupational disease, known as “the L–19 arm” has developed—a bruise
                            on the upper pitching arm—caused by repeatedly striking the window frame
                            as the leaflets are flung into the wind.</p>
                        <p>The immediacy of our challenge is reflected in the report of one officer
                            battling to keep hamlet bulletin boards from being shot up constantly by
                            the Viet Cong. In one town he advised the construction of a reinforced
                            concrete bulletin board and up went the latest posters. True to
                            precedent, the Viet Cong tried to destroy it, but the board held and the
                            patrol fled. There was beautiful irony in the theme of the bullet proof
                            exhibit that the Viet Cong were unable to ruin: <hi rend="italic">how
                                the Viet Cong fails to prevent the facts from reaching the
                                people</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Yes, our officers’ days and nights out there can be quite different from
                            life at more sedate and sartorially splendid posts. They tell of one
                            particularly well-dressed man who after three days under mortar attack
                            and nights in a slit trench remarked of his near lethal experience: “You
                            sure can lose the crease in your pants out there”.</p>
                        <p>After all this, it’s a fair question to ask: how are we doing, and what
                            have we accomplished?</p>
                        <p>To lead off, may I first point out that the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> coordinated effort is only little more than six
                            months old.</p>
                        <p>And then I want to make clear that psychological and informational
                            programs do not operate in a vacuum. They must—over the long
                            haul—reflect the realities of situations. True national images—like
                            personal ones—cannot be created by trick lights or soft focus.</p>
                        <p>But we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> advise and assist in showing how modern
                            methods can be established, how channels of communication can be opened
                            up so that a vital flow of ideas, information, the facts may reach all
                            the people.</p>
                        <p>Through such methods and channels the Vietnamese can learn, for instance,
                            of strengthened American commitments, of the rise of their own national
                            morale, of the increased terrorism of the Viet Cong, of
                            Vietnamese-American military successes.</p>
                        <p><pb n="226" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_226"/>On this score a senior
                            correspondent for a distinguished London journal wrote from Saigon only
                            a couple of weeks ago that the impression of a mood of defeatism has
                            “gone” in the South and has been replaced by an “all pervading certainty
                            that the war cannot be lost”.</p>
                        <p>He goes on: “The notion spread by the communists the world over that the
                            Viet Cong movement is a spontaneous, indigenous and gallant agrarian
                            revolt against a repressive Saigon regime is self-evident nonsense. The
                            Viet Cong’s exceptionally revolting system of rule by sudden terror,
                            murder, and mutilations, which understandably evokes counter-terror, is
                            a system under which 1,100 village and hamlet chiefs and other local
                            officials were assassinated in one year—a living advertisement for Mao’s
                            dictum that power grows out of the barrel of a gun . . . If the Viet
                            Cong movement had any genuinely convinced support among the South
                            Vietnamese populace, it is scarcely conceivable that the National
                            Liberation Front should have totally failed to attract a single
                            Vietnamese of any standing or caliber in the South, even during last
                            year’s nadir of hope.”</p>
                        <p>One way to gauge your psychological effectiveness is how sharply the
                            opposition reacts. Let’s look at the record. The North Vietnamese army
                            paper, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, has said: “They—the South Vietnamese and the
                            Americans—have resorted to the use of radio stations, leaflets,
                            anonymous letters with counter-revolutionary contents slandering us with
                            despicable and disgusting arguments, and false rumors fabricating
                            thrilling and attractive stories in the hope of creating skepticism, the
                            fear of war and of the United States among our people.”</p>
                        <p>Another case: “They take advantage of the poor political standards, the
                            inquisitiveness and talkativeness of a number of persons in order to use
                            them as loudspeakers to disseminate their psychological warfare venom in
                            an unconscious way.”</p>
                        <p>And on September 11 Hanoi Radio’s <hi rend="italic">domestic
                            service</hi>—not designed for foreign consumption—reported that: “. . .
                            the enemy has intensified its activities against our installations and
                            dropped leaflets spreading false rumors with the aim of sowing confusion
                            among our cadres and people. The revolutionary vigilance and the
                            fighting spirit of our cadres and people are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            as high as desired.”</p>
                        <p>Another way to measure results—set within the context of psychological
                            potentials—is to chart the course of defections by the Viet Cong and
                            their supporters.</p>
                        <p>Here it is significant to note that the rate of defections has trended
                            sharply upward over the past twelve months. For instance, the January
                            1965 figure was 406. But by December it had climbed to 1,482. During
                            1964 the number had averaged out to something between 150 and 200
                            monthly. By the latter half of 1965 this average was over the 1,000
                            mark.</p>
                        <p><pb n="227" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_227"/>I cite some instances of
                            specific action and reaction. On October 24, copies of eight different
                            leaflets were airdropped into Viet Cong threatened areas in 15 southern
                            provinces. Calls to defect were carried directly to the enemy by
                            loudspeakers, airborne and located on the ground. Over the next three
                            weeks a careful check was made of Viet Cong defectors. Of 86 coming from
                            the areas covered, 62 carried with them copies of the leaflets dropped
                            on October 24.</p>
                        <p>In another area a similar effort produced the joint defection of a 22-man
                            Viet Cong guerrilla platoon and an eight-man Viet Cong cell, the largest
                            single Viet Cong unit defection in the war to date.</p>
                        <p>During last month—January—the Vietnamese Government’s Psychological
                            Warfare Ministry carried out an intensive propaganda campaign to
                            coincide with Tet—the seven-day Vietnamese observance of the lunar new
                            year—which is a celebration with profound nationalist, cultural and
                            religious implications. <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>
                            provided considerable logistical support and other assistance to the
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>Its principal objective was to enhance the confidence of the Vietnamese
                            people in their Government and to erode the faith of the Viet Cong and
                            North Vietnamese Army forces in their own leadership and cause. Stress
                            was laid on the Government’s <hi rend="italic">chieu hoi</hi>—open
                            arms—program.</p>
                        <p>Just a few days ago I learned that during January there were 1672 <hi rend="italic">chieu hoi</hi> returnees—this sets a record. Now these
                            results, obviously, can be only partly attributable to the Tet campaign,
                            and they are only very early straws in the wind—and nothing more. But
                            they do give reason for sensible hope.</p>
                        <p>Where do all these psychological and information programs lead?</p>
                        <p>In a profound and long-term sense we Americans—through the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> experience—are gaining
                            invaluable insight into how best to blunt and turn the thrust of what
                            the communists call “wars of liberation”—to wit: the tragic visitation
                            upon innocent people desiring only peace and freedom of subversion,
                            infiltration, guerrilla operations, terror tactics. There can be no
                            doubt that the somber prospect of possible future “liberating wars”
                            makes it essential that we develop—in the free world—highly effective
                            techniques to stop the communists at their new ploy for conquest.</p>
                        <p>In South Viet-Nam itself these psychological and informational programs
                            can result in the firm forging of continuing and effective lines of
                            communication to allow discussion and decision among the people and
                            between them and their Government. It can also save and widen the
                            opportunities for Viet-Nam to participate and to gain from the constant
                            international exchange of ideas, inventions and innovations between the
                            free nations of the world.</p>
                        <p><pb n="228" facs="0269" xml:id="pg_228"/>The South Vietnamese want this
                            freedom and they have the inalienable right to enjoy it.</p>
                        <p>Let me give you just one example of how badly they want it, and I quote
                            from a recent <hi rend="italic">Editor and Publisher</hi> article
                            datelined Bloomington, Indiana:</p>
                        <p>“Prophetic words were spoken a year ago at Indiana University by a South
                            Vietnamese editor. He was murdered recently in front of his home in
                            Saigon by the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>“The slain editor was Vu Nhat Huy, editor-in-chief of Viet-Nam’s second
                            largest newspaper, Chinh Luan (Right Reason). A year ago he was in a
                            group of 19 newsmen who spent four months in the Foreign Journalists
                            project, sponsored by the State Department, which is based at Indiana
                            University.</p>
                        <p>“Professor Floyd G. Arpan, director of the program for the past 15 years,
                            recalled that at a seminar on the campus, Mr. Huy asserted:</p>
                        <p>“‘All of us must fight for principles, and in South Viet-Nam we are
                            engaged in a life and death struggle for those principles. Some of us
                            will die for those principles.’. . .</p>
                        <p>“According to press dispatches, he was one of many Vietnamese newsmen who
                            received letters from the communists threatening them with death if they
                            did not moderate their editorial policies to suit the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>“Chinh Luan published the letter he received along with an editorial of
                            defiance of the communists. According to press dispatches, a gunman
                            killed Mr. Huy when he arrived home for lunch with his wife and six
                            children.”</p>
                        <p>There is then this one bedrock humanitarian issue of ultimate principle
                            and purpose—the fate of every Vietnamese man, woman and child. The
                            Vietnamese people want peace, independence, social and economic
                            progress. We know that it is the free world that can help them best to
                            achieve these ends. They must be allowed to have this opportunity.</p>
                        <p>It has been the free and peaceful interplay of minds, and talents, and
                            skills that has produced the most harmonious systems of government and
                            the greatest economic abundance the world has ever known. Mao Tse-tung
                            can assert that power grows out of the barrel of a gun, but it was
                            Victor Hugo who discerned that: “No army can withstand the strength of
                            an idea whose time has come”.</p>
                        <p>This then is the season for testing. The time is now and the place is
                            Viet-Nam. The issues, psychological—in the broadest meaning of that
                            word—as well as military need to be known the world over. For I submit
                            that, in the final reckoning, how the psychological struggle goes will
                            turn out to be as decisive as what happens on the field of battle.</p>
                        <p><pb n="229" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_229"/>The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is now telling the story of that struggle—and all that
                            it implies—to men everywhere.</p>
                        <p>This task, of course, is only one part of our Agency’s role in the
                            foreign affairs establishment. For we have a daily challenge and a vital
                            responsibility to present to <hi rend="italic">the world</hi>, in full
                            and fair perspective, the truth about America in order to gain foreign
                            understanding of our ideals and aims, and—where possible—support for our
                            policies and actions.</p>
                        <p>To carry out this mission we have a huge broadcasting network, movie and
                            television producing studios, a magazine chain, a worldwide
                            radio-teletype service, a cultural, library and exhibit program. And,
                            certainly the most important asset: a dedicated foreign service corps
                            serving in over 100 countries around the globe.</p>
                        <p>Our constant goal is to ensure that no man anywhere chooses tyranny
                            because he has never had the opportunity to know of the philosophy and
                            prospects of freedom.</p>

                        <p>I have been concerned for some time that we may not be getting as much
                            from the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs as we might if they
                            were given more attention and better planned. I am thinking particularly
                            of the American leader grants and the performing artists, which are a
                            major resource in furthering our national objectives.</p>
                        <p>My concern goes both to the quality of the selections and to the choice
                            of what kind of grantees and performers.</p>
                        <p><pb n="230" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_230"/>I believe the Assistant
                            Directors for the areas should be as concerned with and, in effect, know
                            as much about these programs in their respective areas as they do about
                            the ones we finance.</p>
                        <p>This will require two things:</p>
                        <quote><p>(1) Substantially greater initiative on the part of <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s and <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>’s to request well in advance those leaders and
                                performers that will directly support U.S. objectives in their
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>(2) Much closer cooperation between you and the regional branches of
                                    <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in the earliest stages of
                                planning and programming.</p></quote>
                        <p>You should be in a position to support and defend the selection of an
                            American leader grantee or a performing artist for your area as well you
                            are your own programs.</p>
                        <p>I realize there will be differences of opinion and that the position of
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will by no means always
                            prevail. However, when you are in very fundamental disagreement on a
                            major program, or where you think the resources of the Government may be
                            wasted, or where you think a particular grant or tour will be actually
                            harmful, these can be brought to me for direct discussion with Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>.</p>
                        <p>You should also make certain you are aware of and concur in every
                            monetary or other grant to a foreign academic or cultural institution,
                            or to a U.S. institution for activities abroad. We had a recent incident
                            where a grant of $214,000 was made to an American University for
                            cultural activities in Paris, of which no one in this Agency—in
                            Washington at least—was aware.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">According to

                            </opener>
                            <p>As you know I have for some time shared your concern about certain
                                aspects of the exchange program, particularly the selection of
                                American leader grantees and performing artists.</p>
                            <p>I recognize that our policy and desk officers have worked closely
                                with your regional people for some time and that there has been
                                cooperation in planning your program.</p>
                            <p>It occurred to me that this program for which you and I both have a
                                responsibility might be materially enhanced if my Assistant
                                Directors worked more closely with their regional counterparts in
                                your office. I know that you would welcome such further assistance
                                and accordingly, I am instructing my Assistant Directors to keep me
                                fully informed of your program so that I can defend and support it
                                when any inquiry is made.</p>
                            <p>This letter is prompted primarily by our current preparation for
                                hearings before the Appropriations Committee and the realization
                                that in some instances we have not known about your plans until they
                                were announced. Specifically, the recent action making available
                                $214,000 to the University of the State of New York for activities
                                in Paris came at a time when we were retrenching our library
                                activities there to carry out congressional mandates. Obviously,
                                your assistance to the University of the State of New York at this
                                time could have been—and may still be—a source of embarrassment to
                                both of us.</p>
                            <p>The instructions which I have issued hopefully will preclude any
                                similar incident in the future.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Leonard:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am glad to know that you are back, and trust that the many missions you
                            have been performing leave you still as full of bounce as ever.</p>
                        <p>I have waited to respond to your letter of December 20<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> about the flow of
                            communications from <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> to the field
                            until your return. Meanwhile, however, I have talked to Bob <persName corresp="#p_ARW_1">Akers</persName> about your letter, as well as
                            about communications that people on my staff have been receiving from
                                <persName corresp="#p_CHL_1">Howard Chernoff</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The general problem of excessive communications to our posts had
                            concerned me long before I took this post. Immediately on entering it, I
                            asked that procedures be introduced to cut down this flow wherever
                            possible. Our progress is attested by the fact that our Executive
                            Director, <persName corresp="#p_HTE_1">Theo Hall</persName>, recently
                            received a nomination for an honor award from the Department because
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has had a better record since
                            September in controlling communications than any other Bureau of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>You will see, then, that we are entirely on the same road. With regard to
                            the specific matters you put before me, I must say that the record is
                            mixed. While we hear complaints, some of them justifiable, we also hear
                            only too often from the typical Embassy <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> that he “appreciates the guidance and support received
                            from the Department and has no suggestions for improvement” (to quote a
                            recent report<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">Not found.</note> from <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> Cyprus). But I am not satisfied, and
                            will never be satisfied, until I can be sure that we have done
                            everything possible to cut down communications that are unnecessary. I
                            am sure that you in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are making
                            the same effort.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, we have found that some of the bulky items sent out
                            from this office consist of reference material. No one expects the posts
                            to read this material in its entirety. It is essential, however, that
                            they have this material at hand if they are to be able to answer <pb n="233" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_233"/>questions that come up in
                            connection with their administration of exchange programs.</p>
                        <p>However, we have found instances where such material was broadcast much
                            too far and wide, and we are trying to cut down on it. We also are
                            working steadily at eliminating wordiness.</p>
                        <p>I suspect that in many cases procedural and informational material could
                            be communicated to the posts more effectively by improving our use of
                            the Foreign Affairs Manual. We are looking into this possibility
                            urgently. Meanwhile, it is good to know of your progress in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> about communications and I am sure
                            you will be glad to know of ours. We shall work together on this.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            </list>
                            <p>We have now completed negotiations and are prepared to sign on March
                                16 a new two-year exchanges agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>The new agreement provides for a balanced program of exchanges
                                generally comparable in scope and size to the previous program. The
                                agreement also preserves the provisions which keep the program under
                                United States Government direction.</p>
                            <p>In addition, we successfully introduced new language regarding the
                                appearance of performing arts groups in order to prevent any
                                repetition of the “Hello, Dolly!” situation. Henceforth, if the
                                Soviets fail to receive an agreed American group, we now have a
                                clearly understood basis for refusing their groups. The Soviets are
                                also signing today a contract to receive the Iowa State Symphony
                                Band to make up for their failure to receive “Hello, Dolly!”. Thus,

                            <p>After prolonged resistance, the Soviets finally accepted an exchange
                                of two exhibits. The previous agreement had provided for an exchange
                                of three exhibits, but in practice the Soviets refused to approve
                                more than two, since American exhibits are politically troublesome
                                for them.</p>
                            <p>We made clear to the Soviets our concern over obtaining adequate

                            <p>The Soviet decision to negotiate the agreement, after months of

                                on the grounds of Viet-Nam) indicate a Soviet desire not only to
                                keep the exchanges program alive, but also to avoid further
                                deterioration in U.S.–U.S.S.R. relations.</p>
                            <p>The Soviets have indicated that they wish a minimum of publicity on
                                the agreement. Obviously they are sensitive to Peiping’s charges of
                                Soviet-American collaboration. For our part, we see no reason to
                                play up the agreement.<note n="17" xml:id="d82fn17">An unknown hand

                        <p>Since you may be questioned about America’s prestige as a result of
                            current press analyses you may wish to review our findings on the
                            subject. Enclosed is a general summary of our latest World Survey of 22
                            countries and major cities around the world.<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Not found.</note> The “Highlights” section, together with the
                            accompanying charts, gives the gist of the story. The main highlights
                            are underlined in red.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, the general esteem for the United States is still very high,
                            whereas the esteem for the Soviet Union is still on the negative side of
                            the scale. Any esteem for Communist China is hard to find.</p>
                        <p>General reaction to U.S. foreign policies is still far more favorable
                            than unfavorable, as is the case with the “peace” image of America.
                            Judgments of the overall national strength put the U.S. clearly out in
                            front.</p>
                        <p>Trends are somewhat downward, however, in judgments of our foreign
                            policies and our efforts to prevent another war. These trends result
                            mainly from our Vietnam and Dominican involvements.</p>
                        <p>Although we do not have such quantitative measurements of your image as
                            President, press and other analyses indicate that you share the high
                            esteem of the nation and you share blame for some of the nation’s
                            problems. Your determined and confident assumption of control after the

                        <p>Food supplies and population growth are two sides of a major world
                            problem. It is a problem with political as well as economic and
                            humanitarian overtones. It affects the stability and economic
                            advancement of all peoples, especially those in the developing
                            lands.</p>
                        <p>These lands, with their traditional agriculture, are losing their ability
                            to feed themselves as populations grow and demands increase. Many which
                            were food exporters have now become food importers.</p>
                        <p>Present food-exporting nations such as the United States have helped fill
                            the food gap in recent years. They cannot feed the world indefinitely.
                            U.S. commodity stockpiles are declining. U.S. productive capacity and
                            reserves are adequate to help feed the hungry nations for a while. But
                            the U.S., even if it put all idle acres into production, would not be
                            able to meet the food needs of the world for more than 10 or 15
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. can increase its food aid even though its stockpiles are
                            reduced. But this food aid must become part of a vast effort to
                                modern<pb n="240" facs="0281" xml:id="pg_240"/>ize agriculture in
                            less-developed countries. The major U.S. export must be technical
                            know-how.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that most of the additional food needs of the hungry nations
                            must be met through the expansion of their own food production. Unless
                            these nations move to expand their own production now, the food gap will
                            be even greater in the future.</p>
                        <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> said in the
                            new Food for Freedom program he proposed to Congress on February 10,
                            1966, “The key to victory is self-help.”<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">In a
                                February 10 special message to Congress, <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> indicated that he planned
                                to revamp the Food for Peace program renaming it “Food for Freedom,”
                                and emphasize self-help initiatives as a condition for PL–480
                                agreements. For text of the message, and <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s statement on it, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book I, pp.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Food Supply:</hi> In many developing countries,
                            increasing food demands resulting from rapid population growth—and in
                            some instances from rising incomes as well—are outstripping food
                            production plus feasible imports. This means that less-developed
                            countries must step up their own food production, improve their
                            agricultural policies, and put more emphasis on agriculture.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. is prepared to help in these efforts, and is putting more
                            emphasis on agriculture in its foreign aid. Wherever appropriate, the
                            U.S. is prepared to relate its food aid to self-help measures which
                            less-developed countries take to improve their own agricultural
                            production or to accelerate their own economic development in
                            general.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between food aid and self-help is underscored in the
                            President’s proposed Food for Freedom program, through which the U.S.
                            would lead the world in a “war against hunger.” This program envisages
                            use of the vast productive capacity and know-how of American agriculture
                            to help meet world needs. It thus would get away from the frequently
                            troublesome concept of surplus disposal under Public Law 480.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">See <ref target="#d81fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    81</ref>.</note> Farm products would not have to be in surplus
                            to be available under the Food for Freedom program. It would gradually
                            phase out over a five-year period the present policy of selling
                            commodities for local currencies, and would make food aid available on
                            much the same terms as other economic development assistance: credit
                            sale for dollars, repayable over a long term and at a low interest
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. also is prepared to increase its participation in realistic
                            regional and multilateral efforts to help meet food needs, and would
                            like to see other developed countries—both food exporters and
                            importers—assume an appropriate share of the food aid burden. Such
                                assist<pb n="241" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_241"/>ance may take the
                            form of contributions in kind (food, fertilizer, pesticides, shipping
                            services, technical assistance) or in cash.</p>
                        <p>Food aid alone is the road to disaster. Food aid must be a tool of
                            technical aid—a means by which less-developed countries can boost their
                            own production.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Nutrition:</hi> Food aid must also relate to the food
                            needs of the hungry nations. New medical evidence indicates that serious
                            malnutrition, especially protein and vitamin deficiencies, can
                            permanently retard young children—physically and mentally. As adults,
                            they may not be able to do a full day’s work. Improved nutrition thus
                            not only serves the humanitarian purpose of relieving hunger and misery,
                            but also contributes to progress.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. is enriching its Food for Peace shipments where it can to help
                            overcome these deficiencies, and is working with recipient countries and
                            with private industry to develop special foods to help meet nutritional
                            needs. U.S. efforts by themselves cannot solve the problem, however.
                            Local agricultural, health, industrial and commodity development
                            programs all can contribute to improved nutrition. Local production of
                            fortified and formulated foods can be increased, with technical and
                            financial help—public and private—from the U.S.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Population:</hi> Concerned with the problems which
                            rapidly rising populations pose in developing lands, the U.S. has
                            expressed a willingness to help, both to improve statistical
                            understanding of the problem and to establish and expand voluntary
                            programs of family planning. Where appropriate, the U.S. is prepared to
                            give top priority to sound technical cooperation proposals.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. recognizes that agricultural and nutritional improvement will
                            have limited effect in the long run if rapid population growth continues
                            to outrun available food. Hence, to be effective these programs must be
                            coupled with intelligent efforts at population control and family
                            planning.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Treatment</p>
                        <p>We want all audiences to understand and accept the following
                            propositions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Every country has an important stake in the search for solutions to
                            problems of food shortage and malnutrition amid an unprecedented
                            increase in world population. These problems represent not only moral
                            and humanitarian issues for all governments, but also potential threats
                            to the political stability and aspirations of food-short nations.</p>
                        <p>(2) It is important that every country in a position to contribute toward
                            solutions of these problems do so as best it can, through unilateral and
                            multilateral means. It is clear, however, that the combined food exports
                            and reserves of the food-abundant nations could not begin <pb n="242" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_242"/>to fill the growing gap between food
                            supply and food demand. Food aid can help to solve, but cannot
                            accomplish alone, the task of meeting the food needs of food-deficient
                            developing countries. Recipients in turn should relate food aid, no less
                            than other forms of economic assistance, to effective self-help
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>(3) The future stability of each less-developed country requires it to
                            give highest priority to agricultural development and population growth
                            within the overall effort to achieve satisfactory standards of living.
                            These priorities do not impede, but actually enhance other forms of
                            development—e.g., industrial. Application of scientific knowledge to
                            correct a national imbalance between agricultural development and
                            population growth can advance a developing nation toward the goals of
                            overall development.</p>
                        <p>(4) World food problems concern quality as well as quantity. Their
                            solutions require not only determined self-help in food-short countries
                            to increase per acre yields, but also more emphasis on such key factors
                            as improved nutrition and education in nutritional practices, avoiding
                            waste and spoilage, improving food distribution, and effective
                            incentives for farmers.</p>
                        <p>In the above framework, emphasize the following points:</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. is concerned with the world’s food problem, and will continue
                            to do what it can to forestall and alleviate hunger and improve
                            nutrition in food-deficient lands.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. has a notable record of food and technical assistance. Its Food
                            for Peace and technical agricultural assistance program has served both
                            humanitarian and economic ends. (Where possible, translate these
                            accomplishments into human terms to show their impact on people.) This
                            includes, for example, special feeding programs for children; special
                            emergency and disaster donations; sale of foods for local currencies,
                            research on improved crops and livestock, soil and water conservation,
                            farm credit, and improved marketing. Note that in its sales of surplus
                            commodities under the Food for Peace program, the U.S. has been careful
                            not to disrupt normal international markets and has consulted with other
                            exporting nations whose sales might be affected by concessional sales
                            programs. This practice will be continued.</p>

                            geared to supply-demand considerations. By relating food aid to overall
                            development planning and local self-help efforts, it also would provide
                            a realistic and workable incentive to needed agricultural improvements
                            in developing lands.</p>
                        <p>—In private as well as public capacities, the American people are ready
                            to share their well-being with peoples of other nations. In addition to
                            government transactions, private nonprofit organizations in the U.S.
                            cooperate in the Food for Peace program, and otherwise help meet food
                            needs abroad. Private American companies play an important role in
                            helping to meet local requirements for more and better food by providing
                            (1) needed equipment and supplies, (2) capital investments (often
                            jointly with local sources), and (3) technical know-how to help build up
                            local production of fertilizers and pesticides; to develop more
                            efficient storage and distribution methods and facilities; and to fill
                            other related needs. This role of private industry can be enlarged where
                            feasible with appropriate encouragement from abroad.</p>
                        <p>—Where developing countries take the initiative in giving increased
                            attention to population problems, the U.S. is ready to assist. U.S.
                            support of national and international efforts toward a solution of such
                            problems is based on two premises: (1) free choice for the individual,
                            and (2) increased availability of knowledge to the individual for making
                            this choice.</p>
                        <p>—Self-help efforts by developing countries to increase agricultural
                            production and marketing embrace a wide range of activities from both
                            public and private sources. They include the use of more and better
                            seeds, equipment, fertilizers, pesticides and other supplies; flood
                            control and irrigation; better cultural practices; better storage and
                            distribution to avoid waste and spoilage; incentives to farmers—land
                            tenure and farm credit policies, etc.—which will elicit from them a
                            maximum production effort. In all of these the U.S., with its notably
                            productive agriculture, has the kind of broad experience and know-how
                            which can be applied effectively to the problems of other nations.</p>
                        <p>Throughout, make clear that the task of increasing agricultural
                            production and meeting food needs will not be easy. It requires the
                            wholehearted attention and effort of developing countries. It is far
                            from hopeless if undertaken in a determined and intelligent manner. A
                            number of less developed lands have made notable strides in this
                            direction, to the benefit of the entire developmental process. Progress
                            of this kind can be usefully cited to audiences elsewhere. To the
                            extent, moreover, that increased production helps reduce dependence on
                            imports (this may include fertilizers, for instance, as well as food),
                            or <pb n="244" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_244"/>enhances the capability to
                            expand agricultural exports, it also helps build up foreign exchange
                            needed to advance the total economic development of a nation.</p>

                                    and Hue, led protests against the military junta-based

                                    called for an end to the Ky government. They also demanded a

                                    constitution be drafted immediately, not at a later date as Ky

                        </list>
                        <p>This memorandum is being written on the optimistic basis that the current
                            crisis will somehow be resolved, that a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                operandi</hi> satisfactory to the Buddhist Institute, the current
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> and other major forces will be
                            reached, and that a constitution will be written which will lead to the
                            installation of an elected, more or less representative civilian
                            government. Assuming that this is the way the next act will unfold, what
                            should we have learned from the last crisis which will help deal with or
                            even (ever hopeful) prevent the next.</p>
                        <p>Certainly we did not need this crisis to teach us how fragile the
                            government of South Viet-Nam—any government of South Viet-Nam—is. That
                            we already knew or should have known. Similarly we knew how badly the
                            political and social structure of Viet-Nam is fractionized; and how
                            lacking each faction is in positive political ideas or programs. We
                            knew, too, how the society is lacking in competent leaders dedicated not
                            to the furtherance of a particular group or interest but to the building
                            of the nation.</p>
                        <p>But there are things we either didn’t know or to which we didn’t pay
                            sufficient heed. Admittedly our knowledge about them, even <pb n="246" facs="0287" xml:id="pg_246"/>where it exists, is still not very
                            profound and is based on indirect evidence such as (1) the assumption
                            that a group like the Hue “Struggle Forces” picks on a particular theme
                            because it has reason to believe that the theme strikes a responsive
                            chord among the audience it is aiming at, or (2) the rather surprising
                            degree of unanimity among disparate political groups on a particular
                            subject. What are some of these things?</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Anti-Americanism</hi>. I think it came as a surprise
                            to most Americans that there is an unfortunately large amount of
                            anti-Americanism under the surface in Viet-Nam. As I mentioned in my
                            memo of April 5, this should not surprise anyone.<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">Not found.</note> Nor does it seem to represent a
                            lack of willingness to prosecute the war or a desire that we withdraw
                            our support in the current struggle and “go home.” It seems to be
                            primarily related (1) to the irritations which occur anytime a large
                            body of men, particularly military personnel, are stationed in another
                            country, and (2) to the continued scepticism among many Vietnamese
                            regarding our real and eventual intentions, a scepticism which comes
                            natural to the Vietnamese in view of their history and the efforts which
                            have been made by others to colonize or control them.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Regard for Military Government</hi>. Certainly the
                            apathy toward their government which many observers have noted about the
                            Vietnamese has a basis in truth. But I think there is rather less apathy
                            than many thought there was. It seems obvious now that there is a
                            surprising amount of unanimity in dislike of being governed by the
                            military among most leading Vietnamese civilian figures and religious
                            leaders, among high school and university students and probably among a
                            majority of, at least, the educated urban population. If there is
                            anything on which all the different factions seemed to agree, it is that
                            the present government should be replaced by a civilian government.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Desire for Legitimacy in Government</hi>. Related to
                            2 above, is the equally surprising unanimity that Viet-Nam should have
                            some sort of constitution and an elected government which would be more
                            representative of the people than, certainly, any recent government has
                            been. Even Generals Thieu and Ky have felt impelled (through conviction
                            or otherwise) to underwrite this goal.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Our Commitment</hi>. We have established our
                            commitment to Viet-Nam on a “no matter what” basis. The unconditional
                            nature of this commitment has several disadvantages. First, it reduces
                            our leverage in trying to bring our influence to bear. The Vietnamese
                            can afford the luxury of internecine strife because they are sure (we
                            have told them) we will be there to fight the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>. Any hints that we might decide to <pb n="247" facs="0288" xml:id="pg_247"/>reduce our forces or even give up the
                            fight as hopeless are properly ignored since we have told them time and
                            again (in other words, of course) that our support is eternal and will
                            continue no matter what foolishness the Vietnamese indulge in. And
                            second, the unconditional nature of our commitment would make it very
                            embarrassing to us to disengage should the situation deteriorate to the
                            point where there was no other sensible course left open to us.</p>
                        <p>Each of these items is, or should be, something which deeply concerns
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (and <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>). They are all “psychological”
                            matters, “public opinion” matters, matters involving how and about what
                            people think. The basic problems in Viet-Nam are socio-psychological in
                            nature and therefore should concern us professionally very much.
                            Obviously they do, or we would not have invested as large a proportion
                            of the Agency’s resources in Viet-Nam as we have. Consequently, I feel
                            no hesitation in making the following comments even though <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>’s (and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s) operations are not necessarily involved in most of
                            them. The psychological effect of the American presence in Viet-Nam
                            will, needless to say, be effective primarily through what Americans,
                            both here and there, do rather than through what <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> says or prints.</p>
                        <p>A. The signs of the American presence must be reduced to the irreducible
                            minimum. Lip service has been paid to this statement ever since the
                            American build-up. And while much effort has been expended in trying to
                            carry it out, to too large an extent it has remained lip service. There
                            follow a few concrete suggestions not listed in any order of
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>1. Speed up the construction of barracks in military compounds outside
                            the towns and cities (even if at the expense of other military
                            construction) and release all possible in-town housing and office space.
                            On the civilian side, housing arrangements should be made in such a way
                            as to reduce to the minimum its impact on the Vietnamese. I know that
                            much is being done along these lines. I suspect that, if we accept the
                            inconveniences and drawbacks, more could be done.</p>
                        <p>2. Work with the Vietnamese authorities to relocate bars and other
                            amusement and recreation spots from the centers of the towns to military
                            compound areas. There will be objections and oppositions to this not
                            only from the American servicemen but also from the Vietnamese who are
                            profiting from the current situation. Perhaps one way of handling this
                            is to rule that all in-town bars will be declared off limits after a
                            given date, set perhaps three months away so that the bar owners would
                            have time to relocate.</p>
                        <p>3. Eliminate such annoyances as the loud music which envelops much of
                            downtown Saigon from the Officer’s Bar on the top of the <pb n="248" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_248"/>Rex <gloss target="#t_BOQ_1">BOQ</gloss><note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">Reference is to the Rex
                                Hotel in downtown Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City). In addition to
                                housing a U.S. military <gloss target="#t_BOQ_1">BOQ</gloss>, the
                                Rex Hotel was also the location for the daily U.S. military
                                briefings, colloquially referred to as the “Five O’Clock Follies,”
                                which were organized by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>.</note> and the eternal racket which emanates from
                            the generators in front of military housing and office installations and
                            the dozens of other similar small nuisances and annoyances (such as the
                            handling of garbage in Da Nang). Perhaps a combined Vietnamese-<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> group should be set up to identify these
                            irritations and make arrangements for their elimination.</p>
                        <p>4. Crack down on the speed and driving practices of drivers, American or
                            Vietnamese, of American civilian and military vehicles.</p>
                        <p>5. Insofar as possible, redirect military traffic so that it will not
                            interfere with civilian life.</p>
                        <p>B. To some extent the signs of the American presence can be made more
                            palatable through effective community relations programs. The
                                Vietnamese-<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Friendship Councils
                            which exist in some places should be established wherever there are
                            American troops. (In theory these probably have been so established.) On
                            the Vietnamese side, the membership should be broadened so that these
                            Councils represent more of Vietnamese life than just the government and
                            the “Establishment.” Student leaders, religious leaders, political
                            leaders should also be involved. And the Councils should be given some
                            authority if they are to serve a real purpose and if the right kind of
                            Vietnamese are to take an active part. Certainly the demands of these
                            Councils might become annoying to American military commanders. The
                            alternative, however, is likely to be more than annoying to American
                            national objectives. We also have to do a better job in educating
                            American civilians and soldiers alike on Vietnamese history, culture and
                            customs and in seeing to it that Vietnamese customs are respected. Here
                            again, much has been done but not enough. Too much has been lip
                            service.</p>
                        <p>C. The warning against having too many Americans in Viet-Nam has been
                            raised many times. This fact does not lessen its importance. Nor does it
                            mean that every effort has been made to limit the number as much as
                            possible. For one thing, some Americans are there because we want things
                            done on <hi rend="italic">our</hi> timetable (as fast as possible)
                            rather than on the more leisurely timetable of the Vietnamese. If we
                            were willing to compromise with Vietnamese views regarding the
                            desirability and practicality of doing various things speedily, and plan
                            for their accomplishment within a longer time frame, it is possible that
                            we could do with fewer Americans. The opposite side of this coin is that
                            the personnel we have in Viet-Nam should be as well trained as possible,
                            as knowledgeable about Viet-Nam as we can make them and extremely <pb n="249" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_249"/>sensitive to Vietnamese
                            sensibilities. Although it is not true in every case, in many instances
                            such knowledge and sensitivity is a direct reflection of an officer’s
                            experience in Viet-Nam. To the extent this is true, the current brief
                            tours (a year or eighteen months for civilian agencies and a year for
                            the military non-combat staff) rob the United States of much needed
                            experience, knowledge and talent. There is no use in going over the
                            problems of family separation again. Needless to say, in simple justice,
                            everything possible should be done to ease the officer’s life; in
                            addition, one can hope that he will agree to a second tour. Also, we
                            ought to consider asking for legislative authority to enable the
                            government to make it worthwhile for an officer to extend for an
                            additional year, or return for an additional tour. One way would be to
                            get authority for civilian agencies to pay each officer a 50% hardship
                            differential on a second tour with the differential remaining at 25% for
                            the first tour; perhaps a second tour bonus could be paid the military
                            similar to the current reenlistment bonus. If the family separation
                            problem is met by allowing wives in on a limited basis, perhaps officers
                            serving a second tour could be the first ones to have their wives join
                            them. We should—in other words—do everything we can, including
                            requesting additional legislative authority, to create a situation under
                            which the best officers will have adequate enticement to return for a
                            second tour, especially those in whom the Agency has invested eleven
                            months of Vietnamese language training.</p>
                        <p>D. The U.S. officials in Viet-Nam should be more outspoken in their
                            support of constitutional government for the country and in favoring a
                            representative government of a type acceptable to the Vietnamese. Our
                            understandable support for Diem and for each of the governments which
                            followed his overthrow has, it is quite obvious, given many Vietnamese
                            the idea that we really prefer a “strong man” for Viet-Nam rather than
                            an elective, constitutional government (and indeed many Americans do
                            feel this way). While we certainly have to work with the government in
                            power (assuming that this is possible), we ought to make it clear that
                            we regard it as only an “interim” government and that while we have no
                            intention of imposing our views of government on the Vietnamese, we will
                            consider as “permanent” only one which is based on a large measure of
                            representative-ness and which is the result of the self-determination of
                            the Vietnamese people—the principle which is at the heart of our entire
                            Vietnamese policy.</p>
                        <p>E. As I said at the beginning, this paper is based on the assumption that
                            an elected, civilian government will be established in South Viet-Nam. I
                            hope we are considering in advance what the U.S. position is going to be
                            toward those things which an elected legislative and executive body is
                            likely to bring up which we would rather it didn’t. I think it is in the
                            nature of things for an elected Vietnamese government to <pb n="250" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_250"/>desire to show its sovereignty and its
                            independence of the United States. Indeed, it is probably in our
                            interest that it do so. The easiest way to do this, and the most
                            visible, is to insist on things being done their way rather than ours,
                            and to insist that we agree to conditions we don’t like. We ought to try
                            to decide in advance which of these we are willing to give on,
                            reluctantly of course, and which we are not and will insist on as a
                            condition of our continued aid. While it is impossible to foretell what
                            the specific issues are going to be, the following are likely:</p>
                        <p>1. A Status of Forces Agreement.</p>
                        <p>2. Limitations on the manner in which the war is fought—restrictions or
                            prohibitions on the use of napalm, for instance, or on Harassment and
                            Interdiction Fire.</p>
                        <p>3. The establishment of brothels and amusement centers for American
                            troops within compound areas, with towns and cities themselves declared
                            off-limits to most personnel.</p>
                        <p>F. Americans have, on many occasions, discussed the need for Viet-Nam to
                            develop two or three strong parties, if an elective system is to work,
                            to replace the more than forty that are now registered (which number is
                            likely to be increased with the institution of meaningful elections). I
                            am aware of no decisions ever having been made, nor have I ever heard
                            any really good ideas as to how we can help in this effort. Indeed, I
                            don’t have any bright suggestions to make, either. But the timetable for
                            accomplishing this has shortened radically with the development of the
                            present situation, and I hope that competent people are thinking about
                            it.</p>
                        <p>G. To repeat another statement which has almost become a truism, we have
                            to do better and better in respecting the forms of Vietnamese
                            sovereignty and be ever more careful regarding statements made in
                            Washington and similar matters. You know the problem as well as I do,
                            and I raise it again only because it is of very great importance.</p>
                        <p>H. We should rethink our relationships with Buddhist organizations. While
                            we have maintained liaison with them, it has been to some extent in an
                            atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust (possibly well deserved). But the
                            fact is that the major Buddhist organizations, especially the
                                Institute<note n="5" xml:id="d85fn5">Reference is to the Buddhist
                                Institute.</note> and its subordinate groupings, are among those
                            best able in the country to obtain action and sacrifice from their
                            members and to plan and execute imaginative, even if destructive,
                            projects such as that of the “Struggle Forces” in Hue.</p>
                        <p><pb n="251" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_251"/>I. In my memorandum of April 5,
                            I also commented on the quality of reporting from Viet-Nam. It surely is
                            obvious to everyone that we know less about what the Vietnamese are
                            thinking (or planning) than we wish we did, or should. A corollary of
                            this is the eternal optimism associated with Americans in Viet-Nam.
                            Somehow we always seem to convince ourselves that things will turn out
                            for the best—for us. Because we thought that stability in the Saigon
                            Government under General Ky was essential for the prosecution of the
                            war, we refused to give credence to the few indicators there were which
                            showed that the government was unstable and that opposition to it was
                            wide-spread; fearing that elections at this time would open the
                            possibility of <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> infiltration into the
                            structure of government, we did not consider that the Vietnamese might
                            demand an elective system anyhow. And so on. To too great an extent,
                            understandable as it is, we continue to look at Viet-Nam through
                            American eyes, instead of trying to understand it as a Vietnamese would,
                            difficult as that may be. There are no easy answers here, but a change
                            in the overall spirit in which we approach Viet-Nam and our operations
                            there would help.</p>
                        <p>J. Also in my April 5 memo, I made the point that we are not devoting
                            enough of our resources to establishing, maintaining contact with,
                            helping educate and persuade the urban audiences, especially the student
                            leaders, the teachers and professors, the religious, social and
                            political leaders as well as the mass media operators. I simply repeat
                            that this element of our operations, especially <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>’s, needs more emphasis.</p>
                        <p>K. As I said in 4 above, psychologically the unconditional nature of our
                            commitment has been a handicap. The Vietnamese would, I submit, be much
                            less likely to indulge in serious quarrels among themselves at this
                            point in history if they weren’t so sure of our shield, and would be
                            more amenable to our suggestions on things we thought vitally important
                            if there were the possibility that we might pull out. Consequently, I
                            suggest that little by little we start putting conditions into our
                            support. In my view these should be so phrased that we guarantee our
                            support:</p>
                        <p>1. As long as that support and assistance is desired;</p>
                        <p>2. As long as the Vietnamese maintain and support a government which is
                            acceptable to the bulk of the population, and</p>
                        <p>3. As long as that government actively prosecutes the war and equally
                            actively undertakes the measures necessary to bring about the social
                            revolution we have all agreed is essential.</p>
                        <p>Not only will this change in attitude be helpful in our dealings with the
                            Vietnamese, it will make our path world-wide (and particularly in the
                            Asian area) much easier if we find that we have no choice but to
                            disengage and withdraw.</p>
                        <p><pb n="252" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_252"/>L. Lastly, I would suggest that
                            we should be well prepared with contingency plans in case the pessimists
                            turn out to be correct and an elected civilian Vietnamese government be
                            weak, faction-ridden and completely unable to cope with the situation.
                            Unfortunately, the chances are at least 50–50 that this will turn out to
                            be the ugly reality.</p>

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> has been
                            sounding more and more defensive lately on the issue of preparedness for

                            submitted a thoughtful paper on the effect of this on our global
                            strength image, and what might be done to improve it. It seems to me
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> might
                            appreciate a little down-to-earth advice, and that the reasonableness of

                            You might consider communicating these ideas either orally if a

                                    IMAGE</hi></p>
                            <p>The basic U.S. strength image, which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has taken some pains to maintain over the years,
                                is in danger of erosion. The fundamental problem—the strain on
                                American manpower and supplies from the Vietnam effort—is inherent
                                in our national decisions. But the way we speak of this problem can
                                and should be improved.</p>
                            <p>The current hazard to the national strength image comes from two
                                sources—an ostrich policy on transfers of men and equipment from
                                Europe to Vietnam; and the continuing domestic commotion over
                                shortages and delays in the Vietnam effort. It is submitted that
                                these hazards could be met by abandoning the present information
                                policy of defensive secretiveness and adopting a positive and
                                forthcoming policy.</p>
                            <p>The secretiveness on Europe-to-Vietnam transfers, a problem area we
                                are just getting into, is especially harmful. When the news leaks
                                out—as it has just done on the withdrawal of 15,000 men from
                                    Germany<note n="4" xml:id="d86fn4">Information regarding the
                                    U.S. troop withdrawal from Germany was reported in the<hi rend="italic"> New York Times</hi> on April 8. (Benjamin
                                    Welles, “15,000 U.S. Troops to Leave Europe,” April 8, 1966, p.
                                    1)</note> and the removal of three air squadrons from Italy and
                                Turkey—the United States image is hurt in two ways: (1) our general
                                credibility and our pledged word to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is compromised, as the withdrawals follow two
                                years of official U.S. reassurances that no major combat units would
                                be removed from Europe; (2) our strength image suffers because the
                                impression is created that desperate need is forcing us to abandon a
                                firm prior commitment to preserve U.S. forces in Europe.</p>
                            <p>How to correct this? First, we need to place announcements of our
                                various actions in the positive perspective of our world primacy in
                                military strength, about which too little has been said in the past
                                year. Second, the announcements of withdrawals from Europe, or
                                answers to charges of shortages, should be frank and forthcoming.
                                Once we have re-established the image of our overwhelming total
                                strength, the details will fall into proper perspective and we will
                                not need to be so defensive.</p>
                            <p><pb n="254" facs="0295" xml:id="pg_254"/>A list of points which could
                                usefully be made, both in high-level official statements and in
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> output, might read
                                something like this:</p>
                            <quote><p>(1) The U.S. military strength is far and away the world’s
                                    greatest.</p>
                                <p>(2) The U.S. is deliberately refraining from using its tremendous
                                    nuclear power, in Vietnam or anywhere else. U.S. nuclear forces
                                    are kept under constant control to prevent war by accident.</p>
                                <p>(3) The U.S. is using in Vietnam only its non-nuclear forces,
                                    deployed at greater distances and with greater mobility than
                                    ever before achieved by any nation.</p>
                                <p>(4) The U.S. and the South Vietnamese are fighting a carefully
                                    limited war, thinking out each move to avoid escalation and
                                    frequently spelling out its aims to encourage a settlement.</p>
                                <p>(5) Despite these self-imposed limitations, the U.S. and South
                                    Vietnamese forces are winning in Vietnam. (NOTE: This fact
                                    should be pointed up much more than we have been doing,
                                    preferably in scholarly, military-analyst terms.)</p>
                                <p>(6) The U.S. will need to draw on its very large <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> forces in Europe from time
                                    to time to meet special needs in Vietnam. This will be
                                    temporary, will leave the great majority of U.S. forces in
                                    Europe untouched, and will probably include ___________,
                                    ___________ and ___________ (as many specifics as

                        <p>Last night I listened to Radio Moscow. The commentary referred to
                            American butchers, the greed of American imperialists, the $2 billion

                            signed a cultural exchange agreement with the Soviet Union<note n="6" xml:id="d87fn6">U.S. and Soviet officials signed the cultural

                                States and the Soviet Union. The first was signed in 1958. For more

                        <p>Our exhibits in the Soviet Union have been immensely popular. These major
                            efforts—which have covered such subjects as transportation, medicine,
                            communications, and architecture—have been seen by millions of Soviet
                            citizens in a wide geographic range of cities and areas. One on graphic
                            arts, for example, was seen by more than one and one half million people
                            in Alma Ata, Moscow, Yerevan, and Leningrad—smashing all records for
                            attendance at an American exhibit in the Soviet Union.<note n="8" xml:id="d87fn8">The exhibit is detailed in a June 1, 1964,

                        <p>At the exhibits, our young, Russian-speaking American guides are
                            invariably as popular as the items on display—and sometimes perhaps more
                            so. They answer an insistent flood of questions about every conceivable
                            aspect of life in America.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the questions asked most frequently at one of our
                            exhibits in Leningrad.</p>
                        <p>“How much do you make a month? How much does a new car cost? How much
                            does a kilogram of butter cost? Of sugar? Of bread? Of meat? How come
                            you have so many unemployed people in America? How do the unemployed
                            live? Where do they get the money to live on? How do you pay for medical
                            service? Higher education? Do you jam Radio Moscow? How much does an
                            apartment cost to rent each month? How long must you wait to buy a car?
                            A phone? A house? Do you have all the produce you need in the stores?
                            Are there a lot of gangsters in the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>? What will you do when your workers revolt? Can a worker in
                            America really save enough money to start his own business?”</p>
                        <p>Another highly effective means of communication with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Poland is our full color
                            magazine <hi rend="italic">America Illustrated</hi>, which covers the

                        <p>An independent observer, the Moscow correspondent of the Swedish daily,
                                <hi rend="italic">Svenska Dagbladet</hi>, wrote a couple of months
                            ago:</p>
                        <p>“It happened on Gorky Street in Moscow, which could rightly be described
                            as the main shopping street of the capital. On the sidewalk, there
                            formed a line of people about a hundred yards long, which is quite long
                            even for Russian lines. The people crowded and scuffled. I joined the
                            line to find out what sensational items could possibly be on sale. Maybe
                            nylon stockings, foreign woolen sweaters, bananas, Polish beer or newly
                            pickled cucumbers? . . . At long last, I elbowed myself to the
                            objective—an ordinary news stand, where they were selling the American
                            magazine ‘America.’ The buyers literally snatched the magazines out of
                            the hands of the clerk, started leafing through the publication and
                            discussing it among themselves.”</p>
                        <p><pb n="257" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_257"/>We have also direct,
                            instantaneous contact with the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern

                            of America. The Voice broadcasts a blend of programming designed to
                            inform a wide range of listeners. This blend includes an objective and

                            effectiveness, especially to young people and the intellectual and

                            Corporation, and other stations are almost as frequent fare for Soviet
                            listeners as the official controlled Soviet radio”.<note n="10" xml:id="d87fn10">Reference is to Peter Grose, “Leaders in Soviet

                            his country some day. He wound up: “In the meantime, please play for me

                            no flag. But it is the most loyal ally that freedom knows. It is the
                            mission, therefore, of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to be

                            objectives by (1) informing audiences overseas of American foreign and
                            domestic policies and views, (2) influencing attitudes in foreign
                            countries, and (3) advising your Government on foreign public opinion

                        <p>To do this my Agency maintains posts in 105 countries; we use almost
                            every known means of communication from ancient Asian morality plays to
                            modern orbiting relay satellites. But I say, that the most effective
                            means of communication is face-to-face contact. We have American
                            personnel—whom I often call the unsung heroes of our Service—from the
                            high reaches of the Andes to the jungle swamps of the Mekong River
                            delta.</p>
                        <p>The Voice of America is one of our principal instruments to get the word
                            through—not only to the Soviet Union and to Eastern Europe—but around
                            the world and around the clock. We broadcast, live and direct from
                            Washington, 838 hours of short wave programs a week, and place another
                            15,000 hours on tapes and disks weekly on some 3,000 local radio
                            stations at points scattered around the globe.</p>
                        <p>We use 100 transmitters, here and overseas, with a total power of about
                            15 million watts or, to put it in familiar perspective, the equivalent
                            of 300 maximum-power domestic radio stations. The <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s transmitting complex at Greenville,
                            North Carolina, is the largest and most powerful long range broadcasting
                            station in the world, packing a 4,800,000-watt punch.</p>
                        <p>And then there is television. <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> is
                            expanding across the globe at a startling rate. Our <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> television programs are screened now
                            in more than 86 countries—and reach an estimated audience of almost 393
                            million. In Latin America, for example, 211 <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> stations in 25 countries carry <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs.</p>
                        <p>Or take motion pictures. We now produce about 600 documentaries and
                            shorts each year for audiences that number in the hundreds of millions.
                            People see them in their own commercial theaters, in our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> auditoriums, in universities, and
                            associations and organizations of every type that bring important
                            audiences together. Our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> mobile
                            units take films into the provinces and villages. Our newsreel, <hi rend="italic">Africa <pb n="259" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_259"/>Today</hi>, is seen by some 20 million Africans monthly in 1,540
                            theaters across that crucial continent.</p>

                            to Mexico.<note n="17" xml:id="d87fn17"><persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> visited Mexico April 14 and 15. He met with
                                Díaz Ordaz on April 14 and dedicated a statue of <persName corresp="#p_LRA_1">Lincoln</persName> in Mexico City on April
                                15. For the memorandum of conversation detailing their meeting, see
                                    <ref target="frus1964-68v31#d356"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                pp. 417–421.</note> Incidentally, Mexican press comment on his
                            journey was heavy and enthusiastic. <hi rend="italic">El Sol de
                                Mexico</hi>, for instance, saw the visit as having “written one of
                            the most important pages in history, not only as it pertains to Mexico
                            and the nation of <persName corresp="#p_LRA_1">Lincoln</persName>, but
                            also with respect to all of the Americas.”</p>
                        <p>Utilizing a Mexico City radio station as the originating source, the
                            Voice of America broadcast coverage of the ceremonies over a network of
                            more than one hundred stations in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>An inevitable question in all of this is the one of effectiveness. Well,
                            one way to measure that is the reaction of our adversaries. Let me cite
                            just one instance of that.</p>
                        <p>In a French language broadcast to Africa on January 28, Radio Moscow
                            said:</p>
                        <p>“The U.S. Information Centers stop at nothing to attain their aims. They
                            deceive public opinion, spread false rumors and interfere in the
                            internal affairs of African peoples. There are some Africans who close
                                <pb n="260" facs="0301" xml:id="pg_260"/>their eyes and believe
                            American propaganda, but they are those whose economic interests depend
                            upon the foreign monopolies. One thing is certain, however: it is
                            becoming more and more difficult for U.S. propaganda to poison African
                            consciences, particularly that of the fighting youth who thirst for
                            knowledge.”</p>
                        <p>And then a report came across my desk a few days ago stating that at the
                            height of the recent coup d’état in one of the African countries, many
                            of the thousands of demonstrators who marched past the U.S. Cultural
                            Center shouted, “Don’t touch these windows. They are our friends.”
                            Immediately after burning several buildings nearby, the demonstrators
                            stationed themselves in front of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> center as protectors.</p>
                        <p>I also know that the president of another African country takes daily
                            English language lessons with Peace Corps volunteers and at the same
                            time is deep in works on American Government and democracy supplied to
                            him by the local <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> library.</p>
                        <p>And it was heartening for me to note only last week that Senator
                            Saltonstall devoted his entire <hi rend="italic">Report to
                                Massachusetts</hi><note n="18" xml:id="d87fn18">Reference is to
                                Saltonstall’s April 14 newsletter sent to his Massachusetts

                                an April 15 covering memorandum, is in the National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 306, Director’s Subject Files,

                                1966.</note> to the work of my Agency. I appreciated that because it
                            is of cardinal importance that the people of the United States know of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, what its aims are and what
                            is is able to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>The Senator concluded his <hi rend="italic">Report:</hi> “The basic idea
                            behind the operation of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is
                            that understanding is fundamental to any kind of rapport with people of
                            other countries. Through the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> we
                            are trying to let our friends in other lands know what we stand for,
                            and, from the reports I get through the Appropriations Committee, I
                            believe we are making progress in doing so.”</p>
                        <p>I have come to believe that as long as ideas influence the minds of men
                            and as long as men and their aspirations are a major component of power,
                            ideas—both good and evil—will continue to upset nations, defy armies and
                            write history.</p>
                        <p>America’s ideas are good ideas and they are ideas of essential truth.
                            Thus <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s task is a straightforward
                            and honest one—to tell them to the world.</p>
                        <p>I began my remarks by asking you a question. Why, today do we find the
                            anomaly that although the people of the Soviet Union appreciate and
                            applaud our culture and literature, official media condemn the United
                            States and its actions around the world? It is my sincere belief <pb n="261" facs="0302" xml:id="pg_261"/>that if the people of the
                            Soviet Union were permitted to travel freely and visit our country and
                            see for themselves, if they were permitted to read our literature—our
                            daily newspapers, our magazines, our books—if they were permitted to
                            view our films, and exchange views with our people here in the United
                            States or in the Soviet Union, the abyss of misunderstanding would soon
                            disappear. They would find that we are a peaceful nation, that we covet
                            no territory, that we have no desire to dominate foreign cultures, and
                            that all we seek is a better way of life for all mankind. Our efforts
                            have been greeted with some success and the hope that improvements can
                            and will result, makes us strive daily to further this very important
                            mission.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Leonard:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>You wrote me on March 2<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">See the attachment to
                                    <ref target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note> about several
                            aspects of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> relations, and we have already had a chance to talk
                            fruitfully about some of these questions. In particular, you already
                            have on hand a memorandum giving facts about the grant in support of the
                            Institute of American Studies in Paris, and I trust this information has
                            been useful to you and sets the record straight.</p>
                        <p>However, I find that there were also some matters that you discussed with
                            me in your letter to which I have not yet given a written reply. In the
                            first paragraph of your letter you referred to the American Specialists
                            and Cultural Presentations Programs as areas of joint responsibility. As
                            you know, under Executive Order 11034 of June 25, 1962,<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">Executive Order 11034, signed by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> on June 25, 1962,
                                regarding the administration of the Mutual Educational and Cultural

                            responsibility for these programs <pb n="262" facs="0303" xml:id="pg_262"/>devolves upon <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. However, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has
                            consistently gone beyond the strict requirements of that Order so far as
                            consultation with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is concerned.
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> have regularly collaborated in developing the
                            recommendations for the Cultural Presentations Program that are
                            considered by the U.S. Advisory Committee on the Arts and expert panels.
                            I need hardly tell you that I contemplate no changes in these procedures
                            for cooperation that have been developed, even though final
                            responsibility must obviously rest with <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, which has the budgetary obligation and legislative
                            mandate for these programs. In line with these procedures, the joint
                            recommendations of the Agency and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> for
                            the 1968 program in Cultural Presentations have been presented to the
                            Advisory Committee for its consideration.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the American Specialists Program, the situation, of
                            course, is not quite parallel. This program is part of the general
                            exchange of persons program, and specifically of the cultural exchanges
                            authorized under the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HOE_1">Hays</persName>
                                Act.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">See <ref target="#d14fn4">footnote
                                    4, Document 14</ref>.</note> Responsibility for this activity is
                            delegated exclusively to the Department of State. The collateral
                            interests of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in the program has
                            nevertheless been recognized, and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            has been represented on the Committee which my predecessor, <persName corresp="#p_BLD_1">Lucius Battle</persName>, established to review
                            the qualifications of nominees for American Specialists grants. Once
                            again, I certainly see no reason at this time to alter this procedure.
                            We will always welcome your Agency’s suggestions concerning specialists
                            although, of course, we may not always be able to comply with them, and
                            must retain final decision about the basic procedures, objectives, and
                            plans with regard to this area of our obligations. As background on this
                            matter, you may want to refer to Arthur Hummel’s memorandum of June 26,
                            1964, to <persName corresp="#p_LRA_1">Robert Lincoln</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">Not found.</note> and also to <persName corresp="#p_ODL_1">David Osborn</persName>’s memorandum of August
                            30, 1965, to <persName corresp="#p_AB_1">Burnett
                                Anderson</persName>.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">Not
                            found.</note></p>
                        <p>With regard to all these matters, I believe that the essence of the
                            problem—if, indeed, there is a problem—is not bureaucratic definitions
                            but full and frank communication to ensure that we understand each
                            other’s responsibilities and provide what mutual help we can. As we have
                            said to each other on many occasions, and I think effectively
                            demonstrated, this begins with the two of us. But it must also include
                            our agencies. I will do all I can to foster the spirit of cooperation.
                            Although working relations between our respective area offices have been
                            close, cordial and productive, we cannot remain content with this
                            record. We can do even better.</p>
                        <p><pb n="263" facs="0304" xml:id="pg_263"/>Such cooperation, I believe, is
                            perfectly compatible with what must always be the case in
                            Government—namely, that the agency concerned (in this case, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>)—must obviously retain full
                            responsibility for the planning, budgeting and defense of those
                            activities for which it has been given sole obligation.</p>
                        <p>With all best regards,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            have a chance to turn it over in your mind.</p>
                        <p>In my meetings with Congressman, university officials and teachers, and a
                            good number of people, high and low, in the Executive <pb n="264" facs="0305" xml:id="pg_264"/>branch, I have noted that people
                            generally accept the international education program, but ask, in
                            effect, “What’s new about it?” The degree of the President’s interest
                            and the original qualities of the program have somehow not registered;
                            nor has the program quite emerged as the reflection, in foreign policy,
                            of this President’s special ideals and beliefs.</p>
                        <p>It is time, I think, to give the program new zip and lift. An action by
                            the President to dramatize his interest, and to focus new attention on
                            the program as the distinctive expression of his foreign policy, is
                            highly desirable. This is also important because it is being said that
                            the President is losing the intellectuals (see the <persName corresp="#p_RJB_1">Reston</persName> article, enclosed),<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">Not found attached. Reference is to an article by

                                1966, p. 46.</note> and because old suspicions have been resurrected
                            recently about the government role in relation to the universities.
                                (<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, contracts, etc., etc.)</p>
                        <p>Here are two suggestions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Immediately following the passage of the International Education Act,
                            the President might invite Ministers of Education of all nations
                            (provided they are <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members) to meet
                            to discuss the launching of cooperative educational programs. His stance
                            would be that we do not take it upon ourselves to educate the world, but
                            would like to join with others, if they are interested. He could say
                            that he recognizes that our school system, like those of other nations,
                            has frequently brought up the young in insular or chauvinistic
                            attitudes, but that it is time to see whether the school systems of the
                            world could work together to reverse this old tendency. The purpose of
                            the conference would be to consider first steps.</p>
                        <p>I won’t get into the question here of auspices for such a meeting, degree
                            of publicity, level of representation, etc. If there’s anything in the
                            idea at all, we could come to that. We can also look into whether such a
                            Presidential invitation should come before or after the looked-for
                            passage of the International Education Act.<note n="5" xml:id="d89fn5">Congress passed the International Education Act (PL 89–698; 80
                                    <gloss target="#t_Stat_1">Stat.</gloss> 1066), on October 29.
                                The President signed the Act into law that same day. For <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s remarks at the signing
                                ceremony, held at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book II, pp.
                                1276–1278.</note></p>
                        <p>(2) If this idea seems too big, the President, at the right time, might
                            call a meeting of leading university people to air the main issues
                            affecting a healthy relationship between government and the U.S.
                            academic community. He could say that we recognize that there are
                            problems and doubts, that we are concerned to respect and protect the
                            independence and integrity of our educational institutions, and that <pb n="265" facs="0306" xml:id="pg_265"/>this requires, at the outset of
                            a broad new program, a candid meeting of minds. This would help in many
                            ways, and not least in getting the international education program
                            launched in the right way.</p>
                        <p>I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mean another grab-bag White House
                            conference. The meeting I envisage should be highly selective about
                            those invited—not more than 100, perhaps—and reasonably limited in its
                            agenda and preparation.</p>
                        <p>If either or both of these ideas appeal to you, I would, of course, run
                            them by my colleagues in State.</p>
                        <p>After Paris, I go to Yugoslavia as an official guest of the Yugoslav
                            Government, to discuss our educational and cultural exchange programs.
                            My office will know where I am if you want to write or talk with me.
                            I’ll be back the 27th.</p>
                        <p>Helen and I missed Libbie and you at our party. But we understood. Hasta

                                <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> programming is
                            non-military in objective and essence. Although providing support to the

                                <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> programs are oriented
                            toward the long-range objective of helping to build a sense of
                            Vietnamese nationhood and to promote the emergence of a national
                            consensus.</p>
                        <p>An examination of <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> support to
                            pacification since July 1, 1965 should also be prefaced by the fact that

                            organization only came into being around that time.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps one of the most immediate and tangible yardsticks of <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> contribution to pacification has
                            been the process by which <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>
                            officers are trained and deployed for provincial operation in South
                            Viet-Nam. For one of the vital ingredients in the pacification process
                            is communication, particularly communication between the populace in
                            rural areas and their government. And among the American officers
                            committed to this task in the field is the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> Field Representative—a key individual who functions
                            as psychological adviser as well as operator who utilizes every means of
                            formal and informal communication.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">For

                            Representative strives to help the Vietnamese Information Service close
                            the communication gap that exists between the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> and her officials on the one hand and the Vietnamese
                            peasant on the other. On July 1, 1965, ten such officers were operating
                            in South Viet-Nam. By January, 1966, 31 such <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> officers supported by 73 Vietnamese assistants were
                            stationed and functioning in provincial <pb n="269" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_269"/>locations throughout the country. Since January,
                            several more have been added.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Media Capability:</p>
                        <p>The increase in <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> personnel has
                            also meant corresponding increases in the volume and variety of media
                            output. The following major themes have been given continuing emphasis:
                            explaining the U.S. presence; publicizing <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military victories
                            to bolster Vietnamese morale; promoting the <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> program; generating and
                            maintaining popular support for the government and at the same time
                            seeking to deny it to the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> by exposing
                            their true nature and intent; and exploiting <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> vulnerabilities whether these be found in their rank and
                            file or in their terroristic and other oppressive tactics directed
                            against the people. A quantitative measure of the mix of media output on
                            the above themes would be difficult to develop. For illustrative
                            purposes, a review of increased <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> capabilities, specifically in offset printing in
                            Saigon since July 1965, may provide a graphic picture of progress made
                            by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>. Following are sample

                        <p>Thus, in the last six months in 1965, <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> offset printing had nearly doubled in capacity. The
                            March 1966 figure furthermore reflected the added priority given to
                            printing support for revolutionary development.<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">For further information about “revolutionary

                            The variety and volume of <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>
                            input into this program and the dramatic results in terms of the numbers

                            conducted in support of the program. Furthermore, over a period of
                            months, a trend measurement of this effort emerged and is useful as a

                        <p>Of all psywar products developed in <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> for tactical use in the field, <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> themes have been emphasized
                            above all others. For example, in August, 1965, 10 of the 20 items
                            (posters and leaflets) developed and produced that month were geared to
                            the <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> program. Seen in
                            terms of volume, the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> “psywar”
                            output in October 1965 totaled some 13 million copies, of which 30 per
                            cent were related to the <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss>
                            program. Operationally, <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> field
                            representatives have also given this program their priority attention,
                            utilizing not only printed materials (leaflets, posters, banners and
                            pamphlets) but also airborne and ground loudspeaker broadcasts from
                            tapes and by returnees themselves, public rallies in which films and
                            speakers would be used, and radio or word-of-mouth communications.</p>
                        <p>The 1965 <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> monthly
                            statistics thus provide a graphic picture of this increased <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> effort. The upward trend in the
                            second half of 1965 reflected not only the U.S. military buildup,
                            upswing of Vietnamese morale and the series of <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military successes
                            but also concerted psychological exploitation of these favorable trends,

                        <p>During the second half of 1965, monthly returnee figures had consistently
                            exceeded the 1,000 mark which was double that of any previous month
                            since the program was launched in 1963. It might be noted also that
                            although some 11,000 Viet Cong had defected to the govern<pb n="271" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_271"/>ment side under the fresh impact of
                            this new program in 1963, the total in 1964 was only half that number
                            because of the unfavorable political and military factors. Reversing
                            this trend, the 1965 total again exceeded 11,000 Viet Cong
                            defectors.</p>
                        <p>Numerous anecdotal accounts of the <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu
                                Hoi</gloss> program in action have been reported on other occasions,
                            but perhaps a mention of a couple incidents in this context may serve to
                            illustrate qualitatively the 1965 statistical trend.</p>
                        <p>In Vinh Long province last September, the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> Field Representative there developed a “returnee
                            diary” project. This booklet gave pictorial evidence of good treatment
                            of <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> returnees by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> as well as details of the
                            program such as weapon rewards and per diem payments. Copies were
                            distributed to families known or suspected to have relatives in the Viet
                            Cong. After these “diaries” were distributed in late September 1965, one
                            of the recipients apparently visited her son attached to a <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> unit in the neighboring district and
                            using the booklet convinced him to turn himself in. Six days after
                            distribution, he appeared at the Vinh Long <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> Center with a safe conduct pass torn from the
                            booklet. In November, two Viet Cong defecting with <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> leaflets reported the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> in the area told them to crawl into
                            holes or caves whenever government psywar aircraft appeared in the
                            vicinity. In Tay Ninh Province, one returnee claimed that he rallied
                            because of the drudgery of the task assigned him by his unit: he had to
                            police his area for leaflets following every airdrop.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most concentrated effort was the multi-media <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> campaign conducted
                            countrywide in the two-week period prior to Tet, the Vietnamese New
                            Year, in January 1966. In this <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            campaign with massive U.S. support, more than 130 million leaflets of 25
                            different types were airdropped in <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>
                            areas throughout South Viet-Nam. Additionally, 391 hours of airborne
                            loudspeaker missions were flown, 150 hours of special radio programs
                            were broadcast, ballads and films were specially written or adapted for
                            the occasion, and articles and photos were carried by provincial
                            newspapers. The results were dramatically demonstrated by the
                            record-breaking numbers of <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu

                        <p>The April figure of 1,650 halted the upward trend. The political crisis

                            communicate with the Vietnamese people. To enable the government’s

                                <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> has made forward strides
                            in both areas. To illustrate progress made, attention might be focused
                            on radio and television.</p>
                        <p>The first significant break-through in the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> effort to convince the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> of the need to strengthen Radio Viet-Nam (VTVN) was the
                            decree signed by Premier Ky on September 30, 1965, restructuring VTVN as
                            a semi-autonomous broadcasting corporation within the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>. The decree was but the first step,
                            but it did provide a framework for some badly-needed administrative and
                            fiscal reforms. Changes in organization, personnel policy and pay scales
                            have since gradually been put into effect. The autonomy aspect is solely
                            from the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s administrative
                            regulations, since from the policy viewpoint, VTVN continues to be
                            completely responsive to the Ministry of Information and <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss>. An overall reorganization
                            plan reflecting all the changes was finally ready and scheduled for
                            formal signature in late May, 1966.</p>
                        <p>In the fall of 1965, a technical radio survey preparatory to the
                            completion of a National Radio Network was carried out by a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> representative. At that time, it was
                            estimated that VTVN broadcasting signals reached some 60 per cent of the
                            population. Results of the survey show that if its recommendations were
                            implemented, VTVN as a network could provide round-the-clock coverage
                            for 95 per cent of the population. Approval of the project awaits <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> has also carried out a series
                            of eight-week training courses for Vietnamese Information Service
                                (<gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss>) provincial technicians in the
                            field of audio-visual equipment maintenance and repair. The course which
                            got underway in March, 1966, was the fourth in this series. A major and
                            coordinated radio training effort was a three-month program conducted by
                            a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> team of instructors. A class of
                            98 people selected <pb n="273" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_273"/>from the
                            VTVN and the Voice of Freedom Station studied radio programming and

                            network. The course ended in May this year.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that South Viet-Nam has a total of 500–600,000 radio
                            receivers, each of which has considerable multiple-listenership
                            potential. Radio communication therefore has an integral part to play as
                            the government revolutionary development program is extended to all
                            parts of the country. Studies have shown that radio is the prime news
                            disseminator in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Television is now at its infancy in South Viet-Nam, and it will grow and
                            expand much more slowly than radio. But it, too, will play a vital role
                            in revolutionary development for its programming goal is educational

                            broadcasting in South Viet-Nam were just short of phenomenal. Although

                            November, 1964, it was in the fall of 1965 that the project gained
                            momentum. Approved in November, 1965, by February 7, 1966, television
                            was on-air in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area, with the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AFRTS_1">AFRTS</gloss> sharing the U.S. Navy airborne transmitting

                            telecast for the U.S. troops. For this initial airborne phase, the

                                <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> programs as well as in the
                            management of the <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> institution.</p>
                        <p>Today, over 650 community viewing receivers are operating at key
                            locations in Saigon and surrounding provincial areas in Gia Dinh. <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> therefore is supporting <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> efforts in the <gloss target="#t_HopTac_1">Hop Tac</gloss> area around Saigon. In May, for
                            example, the second in a weekly series of 15-minute shows on the <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> program was telecast by the

                            completion date of October 15, 1966.</p>
                        <p>Another ground station will be built in Cantho, for which a site has been
                            selected. When it comes on the air on January 15, 1967, <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> programs will provide support to the
                                <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> province of An Giang. The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s third <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> station will be in Qui Nhon (on-air target April 15,
                            1967), thus targeting another media resource to the priority <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> province of Binh Dinh. The fourth will
                            be in the Hue-Danang area.</p>
                        <p>An examination of progress in the above “sophisticated” media would not
                            be complete without some attention given to the strengthen<pb n="274" facs="0315" xml:id="pg_274"/>ing by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> of the more conventional and traditionally
                            Vietnamese channels of communication in rural areas. Because daily
                            newspapers are all published in Saigon and circulate mostly in urban
                            centers, <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> was instrumental in
                            the project of developing newspapers for individual provinces which can
                            be shaped into vehicles for the Province Chiefs to communicate with the
                            people. By the end of August, 1965, the Ministry of Information had
                            decided to provide regular budgetary support to 19 such provincial
                            newspapers, all having been started, financed and nurtured by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> up to that time. By the end of
                            September, 24 provincial newspapers were published in key provinces. In
                            the effort to improve the quality of these products, <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> then secured the Ministry’s
                            agreement to a series of two-week training courses for writers and
                            editors of these provincial papers. Before the year was out, the first
                            course in this series was held. By concentrating on basic and practical
                            techniques of journalism, the program enabled the trainees to put what
                            they learned to work immediately. <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>’s effort in shaping this basic communication tool
                            paid handsome dividends when the revolutionary development program was
                            launched. In <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> provinces where
                            provincial newspapers were going concerns, they were ready channels for
                                <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> information to flow to the
                            peasants. In May, <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> feature materials
                            and photos developed by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> have
                            been made a regular part of all 25 provincial newspapers. “News in
                            Pictures” emphasizing <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> and American presence
                            topics is a regular feature in these newspapers.</p>
                        <p>The popularity of South Vietnamese classical opera in rural areas is well
                            known to <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>. Traveling drama
                            troupes performing in this medium, in modern songs and in skits, are
                            thus an effective channel of communication in rural Viet-Nam. <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> succeeded in December, 1965, in
                            arranging for the transfer and consolidation of all U.S.-sponsored drama
                            teams under a joint <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> management and direction. Through the
                            centralized production of a monthly packet of songs and skits with
                            policy themes built in, these traveling troupes combine political
                            messages and entertainment in a traditional Vietnamese format.</p>
                        <p>A spot check shows that in April, 1966, seven of the drama troupes put on
                            161 shows in hamlets and villages, of which 91 were at night, to a total
                            audience of 64,355 people (80 per cent of whom were peasants, 10 per
                            cent students and 10 per cent military). The thrust of these programs
                            was the <gloss target="#t_ChieuHoi_1">Chieu Hoi</gloss> theme. In May,
                            the second issue of the Drama Troupe Magazine, also developed by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>, devoted the entire issue to
                                <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss>. The material included the text
                            of a <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> play for use by all troupes
                            countrywide.</p>

                            Support to <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>It is yet premature to render an overall assessment of the <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> informational input since
                            revolutionary development programs have <pb n="275" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_275"/>been hampered directly or indirectly by unsettled
                            political conditions since mid-April. One can, however, gain some
                            impressions of the nature and scope of <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> support by reviewing the highlights of various
                                <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> projects and activities since
                            February.</p>
                        <p>To provide <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> support, it should be noted
                            that <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> machinery did not need
                            “re-tooling” so much as a series of gear-shiftings, namely: re-adjusting
                            program priorities, shifting personnel assignments and allocating
                            resources within the framework of an overall plan designed to exploit
                            and intensify the social, economic, security and national unity aspects
                            of Revolutionary Development. Such a plan has been drawn up in <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>. The key concept in public
                            affairs support of <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> is not merely to
                            tell the peasant what the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> is doing
                            for him, or to awaken a peasant gratitude for government favors granted.
                            The program must aim higher than mere peasant cooperation motivated by
                            opportunistic expectations of personal gain. The crux is motivation, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> must motivate and educate the
                            peasants to become responsible citizens, not merely of their villages
                            but also of their District, their Province and the Nation. Development
                            of responsible citizens is therefore the business of nation-building. To
                            insure continuing and full supervision of public affairs programs in
                                <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> areas, about a quarter of the

In the <gloss target="#t_IV_1">IV</gloss> Corps, 6,000 <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>-provided posters were used in public rallies
                            organized to explain the new <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            revolutionary objectives. Vinh Binh Province conducted special seminars
                            for civil servants and teachers. The Dinh Tuong Provincial Radio
                            broadcast shows on the work of <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss>
                            cadres. <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> began planning a
                            series of posters for nationwide use, designed to reinforce the effects
                            of the work by <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> teams, emphasizing
                            personal identification of cadres and peasants and the role of each in
                            achieving social revolution.</p>
                        <p>In March, considerable field activities in support of <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> were noted in all Corps areas. In Binh

                            were used by <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> cadres in the newly
                            established hamlet reading rooms and bulletin boards. In Binh Duong
                            Province, photos were made of <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> cadres
                            working with hamlet peasants digging wells, and building dispensaries
                            and schools for refugee children. <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> worked with <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> to
                            get these into media products for Binh Duong and adjacent areas. <pb n="276" facs="0317" xml:id="pg_276"/>Kien Giang Province, for

                            of 73 films supporting <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> concepts and
                            requested additional prints for mopix libraries in <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> provinces. <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> exhibits section began designing a display stand for
                            printed exhibits. Among the printed materials distributed in March were
                            17 <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> posters and plastic rice bags
                            containing a psywar message. The III Corps in April utilized 50,000 of
                            these plastic bags to redistribute to the peasants rice which the

                            cadre training at Vung Tau rolled off the presses last month. At the
                            Vung Tau Center, the first graduation class of <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> cadres was given multi-media coverage. Each of the
                            graduates received from <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> a
                            100-page “<gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> Diary,” which includes a

                            graduation called attention to third-country coverage, in which <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> has played an increasingly
                            significant facilitative role since July 1965. In May 1966, for example,
                                <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> interviews were arranged by
                                <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> for Israeli newsmen,

                        <p>The following is an account of what the Department has done to carry out

                            Affairs, chaired by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Charles Frankel</persName> recorded at its meeting on May 10, the

                        <p>2. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> has
                            requested that geographic offices in his Bureau urgently survey
                            possibilities for holding regional seminars and colloquies abroad and
                            report to him by the end of June. Meanwhile, he is reserving the sum of
                            $1 million, part or all of which will be devoted to such seminars,
                            provided the survey reveals significant possibilities. The subject of
                            seminars has also been discussed at conferences of Cultural Affairs
                            Officers. The Far Eastern officers have made the following suggestions
                            which are now being reviewed:</p>
                        <quote><p>(1) The inclusion of Southeast Asians in the highly successful
                                Kyoto American Studies seminars, held annually, thus providing a new

                            <p>(2) A regional center for international seminars to be established in
                                Bangkok to which scholars from the nearby countries of Laos,
                                Viet-Nam, Cambodia, and Burma might be invited.</p>
                            <p>(3) If the binational foundation is established in India, seminars
                                could be held there on various subjects and might include scholars
                                from the Far East, as well as Near East and South Asia.</p></quote>

                            and communications, and as a regular part of its academic program has
                            brought together senior specialists from Asia and the Pacific, as well
                            as the United States, to explore problems of common concern. These
                            programs of the East-West Center will be continued and their

                            program (such as the International Conference on Social Work). This
                            means timing the visits of international visitors in such a way that
                            they can take advantage of international meetings of special interest to
                            them.</p>
                        <p>3. The Department has continued to look to <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>, and the other U.N. agencies and regional
                            organizations of which the United States is a member, to provide forums
                            for seeking answers to the common problems of mankind. Following
                            conversations held between the Secretary and the Director-General in
                            November, 1965,<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">No record of these
                                conversations has been found.</note> and pursuant to the
                            Presidential Message of February 2, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> has carried on the discussion
                            verbally and in an exchange of letters with the Director-General.
                            Technical problems affect the holding of such meetings. The Department
                            and the Director-General have agreed to the meeting of legal specialists
                            within the next two months to solve these problems. Also, discussions
                            have been opened with <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>
                            concerning the following two meetings:</p>
                        <quote><p>International Meetings on the Use and Conservation of Resources of
                                the Biosphere.</p>

                        <p>4. The Secretary and the Attorney General have issued instructions for
                            new procedures with regard to visas for visitors invited to attend
                            international meetings in the United States. As discussed in the
                            attached press release (Attachment 2),<note n="6" xml:id="d92fn6">Not
                                attached.</note> these new procedures provide for blanket waivers to

                        <p><pb n="279" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_279"/>These procedures were first
                            employed in processing delegates to the meeting of the International
                            Congress of P.E.N. (organization of poets, playwrights, essayists and
                            novelists) being held at New York University June 12–18. The application
                            of the procedures was a notable success, and brought favorable
                            recognition from officials of the organization at the opening session,
                            as well as in the press. A request for the blanket waiver for
                            participants in the XXVII International Congress of Orientalists, to be
                            held at the University of Michigan in August, 1967, is now being

                            copy to all Assistant Directors) giving your views on the cultural

                        <p>(2) A new statement of mission for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            (draft attached).</p>
                        <p>(3) A revised instruction on the Country Plan (<gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss>–1195 of October 21, 1964)<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">Not
                                found.</note> which makes clear that posts may include aspects of
                            the American image as Psychological Objectives. The present wording
                            suggests that this is not so, and many posts have eliminated these from
                            their Country Plans. (For example, half of the posts in Western Europe
                            have no Psychological Objective relating to the U.S. image although a
                            major part of their programs is devoted to it.)</p>
                        <p><pb n="280" facs="0321" xml:id="pg_280"/>(4) The name of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be changed. The name we use
                            in the United States should indicate that we operate abroad; and the
                            word “cultural” should be included in our name both at home and abroad.
                            Because <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> as a title is already
                            well known overseas, I suggest the minimum change in this.</p>

                        <p>These titles should be checked with the Area Directors to be sure that

                        <p>(5) At an appropriate moment, the President might announce both the new
                            name for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and his redefinition of
                            our mission. This could be done casually, at a time when he is making
                            several other announcements, without calling special attention to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(6) In connection with the new statement of mission, each of the media
                            services should prepare a statement of its role in carrying out this
                            mission. The <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> Charter does this
                            adequately for <gloss target="#t_IBS_1">IBS</gloss>, but we have no
                            comparable documents for the other three services. These statements need
                            not be made public, but would serve a useful purpose in clarifying
                            thinking within the Agency on what we are supposed to be doing.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">An unknown hand drew a vertical line in the

                            <p>The mission of the U.S. Information Agency is to strengthen the
                                foreign relations of the United States by (1) building understanding
                                abroad of the United States, its institutions, culture and policies,
                                and (2) helping construct a world of progress and peace in freedom
                                by sharing with other nations information, thought and experience
                                that can contribute to this goal.</p>
                            <p>To carry out its mission, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                                conducts information and cultural programs overseas through all

                                <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>:</salute>
                            </opener>
                            <p>Questions come to me from time to time about the cultural mission of
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. I should like to take
                                this opportunity to give you my views.</p>
                            <p>Our cultural mission is two-fold. In the first place, we are building
                                understanding of the United States as a nation. Peoples abroad do
                                not judge the United States as a world leader, or its policies, in a
                                vacuum: they judge the whole nation—our society and institutions,
                                our culture, our ideals and aims. Even with the myriad
                                communications of the <pb n="282" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_282"/>twentieth century,<note n="6" xml:id="d93fn6">The word “twentieth”
                                    is crossed out and “20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>” is written
                                    above it in an unknown hand.</note> the picture transmitted is
                                often distorted and incomplete. And there are those who seek to
                                amplify distortions and twist the truth. It is our job to present
                                relevant facts where they are not known, to place in perspective
                                those that are. We aim by so doing to strengthen the image of a
                                democratic, dynamic, socially and culturally mature nation in which
                                others can have confidence. Such confidence is an essential
                                underpinning for the conduct of our foreign policy.</p>
                            <p>In many countries we also have a second responsibility that goes
                                beyond projection of the United States. We use the tools of
                                communication, several of them cultural, to bring to other peoples
                                information, thought and experience that can help shape their
                                national development—economic, political and social. This may mean
                                building an understanding of the democratic process; helping to
                                create a sense of national unity; forging attitudes of self-help
                                that will speed economic development; or “ventilating” a closed
                                society with fresh ideas from the outside world.</p>
                            <p>Both aspects of our cultural program contribute to the national goal
                                of constructing a world of progress and peace in freedom.</p>
                            <p>Our cultural mission must be defined country by country according to
                                the local situation and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                                potential. Each of you is faced with the necessity of setting
                                priorities. Perhaps your single most important task as <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> is to distinguish between the
                                merely useful and the essential—to select psychological objectives
                                wisely and fashion a country program that is realistic in terms of
                                the resources at your disposal. Selectivity is particularly
                                necessary in cultural operations, which can easily become so diffuse
                                as to be ineffective. Properly conceived and skillfully executed,
                                however, these operations can be among our most valuable tools.</p>
                            <p>I count upon you and your staffs to make them so.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>

                            Information in its Twenty-first Report to Congress.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2"><hi rend="italic">Twenty-First Report of the U.S.

                            you have made and my comment on each. They are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s purpose and
                                role should cover both present and future objectives</hi>.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should
                                develop long-range plans</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A ten-year
                                (1966–76) plan is recommended</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I concur in your recommendation that we have a responsibility to project
                            U.S. foreign policy from a short and long-range standpoint. We attempt
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>Since taking over the office of Director, I have stressed long-range
                            planning and have emphasized its importance in:</p>
                        <quote><p>a. Planning for the recruitment of trained personnel.</p>
                            <p>b. Instituting language training programs.</p>
                            <p>c. Evaluating the technical facilities which we operate to determine
                                whether they will become obsolete.</p>
                            <p>d. Considering new facilities in light of technological advances made
                                in the art of communications.</p></quote>
                        <p>Consistent with these objectives, I have appointed <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> Dizard as long-range planning
                            officer and have given him specific assignments which are now being
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>In order that we may keep abreast of technological improvements, we have
                            constantly conferred with the National Aeronautics and Space Council
                            representatives to determine the prospective use of satellites for
                            short-wave broadcasting, for frequency modulation programs and other
                            means of communications. Special studies have been instituted on these
                            subjects directed towards our particular problems.</p>
                        <p><pb n="284" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_284"/>I am enclosing at this time a
                            summary which I recently prepared covering certain basic assumptions
                            with reference to political and other circumstances which will influence
                            the operation of the Agency in the 1970s.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should use
                                more research in its plans, programs, budget and
                            evaluation</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In your report you state, “This Commission has long urged that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employ wherever possible modern
                            research methods in order to ascertain when and where it has succeeded
                            or failed, and how it can influence attitudes more effectively.”</p>
                        <p>As you know, our Research Section has carried out specific projects using
                            “modern research methods,” and I am satisfied that the personnel of this
                            section are highly qualified to continue doing so. I am unable to
                            comment on your statement that, “The use of research has been seriously
                            neglected in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to the detriment of
                            the program.” This statement obviously refers to a situation which may
                            have existed prior to my appointment.</p>
                        <p>We are currently using research for planning purposes, to evaluate the
                            usefulness of particular media products, to justify our request for
                            appropriations before the Bureau of the Budget and Congress, and to
                            determine attitudes of foreign populations on significant problems of
                            mutual interest.</p>
                        <p>I have recently determined that research can be used more effectively if
                            it is integrated with the Office of Policy. Accordingly, on July 1, 1966
                            the Research unit will be transferred to that section and the Reference
                            Service will be transferred to the Office of Administration. It is my
                            expectation that this reorganization will bring about a more efficient
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should
                                improve the quality of its programs, products, and
                            personnel</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I concur in this recommendation and we are constantly striving to improve
                            the quality of the programs, products and personnel of the Agency.</p>
                        <p>Effective October 1, 1966, I have named an experienced Foreign Service
                            Officer, <persName corresp="#p_HJJ_1">James J. Halsema</persName>, as
                            Head of the Training Division and he will institute a more vigorous
                            program of indoctrination for our officers assigned overseas. Moreover,
                            arrangements are being made for a larger complement of personnel to be
                            trained at the Foreign Service Institute,<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">Reference is to the United States Government’s primary training

                            of the foreign countries to which officers will be assigned.</p>

                            suggest that “Each <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employee

                            You will be gratified to learn that the Employee Suggestion Program
                            which I instituted immediately after my appointment has resulted in 541
                            suggestions as compared to 110 in a comparable period. Not only have I
                            received valuable suggestions for improvement of Agency material and
                            programs, but we have been able to effect savings of $45,000 as a result
                            of these ideas.</p>
                        <p>Reviews have been made periodically on the usefulness of our magazines
                            and pamphlets. New products will be instituted when the need arises and
                            others will be abandoned when they no longer serve a useful purpose.</p>

                            from typical programs which are being planned. In addition, I have
                            recently received a report on a special investigation made on our Latin
                            American program by Peter Straus, an experienced broadcast station

                        <p>Since my appointment as Director on September 1, 1965, I have met with

                            Specifically, formal meetings have been held with the Public Relations

                        <p>I have previously explained the circumstances which led to the
                            curtailment or reduction of our library service in London and Paris. At
                            this point I would like to give you a report on the current situation in
                            these capitals.</p>
                        <p>In Paris we retained the first floor of the three-story building at the
                            Place de l’Odeon which housed the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            library. A reference collection of 5,000 volumes is in active use. The
                            remaining volumes were transferred to the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Youth Center and to the American Library. Reports from
                            the post disclose that the patronage at the Place de l’Odeon has
                            increased because of the presence of an Institute of American Studies on
                            the 2nd and 3rd floors and that students attending this Institute have
                            made good use of the reference facilities. Considerable use is also made
                            of the augmented collection at the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Cultural Center.</p>
                        <p>In London we maintain a small reference library at the American Embassy.
                            The remaining volumes were transferred to the University of London where
                            they are actively used by the large student population <pb n="287" facs="0328" xml:id="pg_287"/>of the University. Reference queries
                            are being handled by mail and phone. By virtue of these arrangements,
                            there has been no dimunition in service being rendered to the residents
                            of London desiring library access to U.S. library facilities nor to the
                            residents of the United Kingdom seeking reference service. In addition,
                            books are being sent by mail throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>No further reductions have been made in libraries, Binational and
                            Information Centers in Europe. However, improvements have been made in
                            certain facilities and every effort will be made to up-grade the
                            existing centers.</p>
                        <p>The status of our libraries in Europe are under continuing review and
                            efforts will be made to improve the facilities. However, at this time I
                            do not believe that it would be desirable to attempt to expand the
                            facilities in Paris and London described above.</p>

                            <p>In projecting its mission for the 1970’s, the U.S. Information Agency
                                must begin with two related factors. They are:</p>
                            <quote><p>1. the continued need for the United States to maintain its
                                    international leadership both for its own security and that of
                                    the rest of the Free World and</p>
                                <p>2. the continuing expansion of the role of world public opinion
                                    in influencing international issues which affect our national
                                    security.</p></quote>
                            <p>The Agency is guided by two sets of assumptions in projecting its
                                mission for the next five years. The first involves the operational
                                environment which will determine the shape of future Agency
                                activities. The second, determined primarily by the Department of
                                State and other agencies involved in foreign policies, actively
                                relates to the general political environment during this period. A
                                brief summary of the important aspects of the operational
                                environment follows:</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT:
                                    1968–72</hi></p>
                            <p>As it prepares for the 1970’s, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                                must consider its role in a new world communication environment. The
                                fundamental operational factor in this new situation is accelerated
                                change. The characteristics of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> elite audiences are shifting in ways that give new
                                force to the role of public opinion abroad.</p>
                            <p>The Agency’s effectiveness as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy
                                will depend on its ability to adapt its operations to these
                                conditions in the coming years. The key characteristics of these
                                changes are:</p>
                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> elite
                                    audiences are expanding at a greater rate than the general
                                    increase in world population.</hi> The general rate of
                                population increase is about two percent annually. Quantitatively
                                most of this increase is taking place among low-income rural and
                                urban families in underdeveloped countries. By and large, this group
                                is not a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> target audience. The
                                significant audience for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are
                                students, public officials and middle-to-upper class professionals
                                abroad. These groups are expanding in numbers at a faster pace than
                                is the general population. <pb n="289" facs="0330" xml:id="pg_289"/>This is particularly true in underdeveloped countries where the
                                base on which elite-group expansion has taken place has been a
                                narrow one. Eighty percent of the Agency’s operations take place in
                                such countries. In addition, the characteristics of the Agency’s
                                overseas target audiences are changing. It is a younger audience. It
                                is better educated and it is more mobile, both socially and
                                geographically. It is an increasingly urbanized audience, with a
                                higher ratio of women than ever before. The Agency will have to take

                                    available to these audiences are expanding at a rapid rate</hi>.
                                As elite audiences grow, the range of information outlets also tends
                                to increase. This has been particularly true in less-developed
                                countries during the past decade, and it will be increasingly so in
                                the next few years. In Asia, Africa and Latin America, the number of
                                newspapers and libraries has doubled; the number of radio
                                transmitters has tripled. Television, non-existent in these areas a
                                dozen years ago, now is a factor in sixty countries. Higher
                                education facilities in these countries have doubled in the past
                                decade and will probably double again in the next ten years. Thus
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s target audiences not
                                only have greater choices of cultural and informational outlets, but
                                also a greater variety of choice within each medium. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s effectiveness in reaching
                                these audiences depends in large part upon its ability to service
                                their new range of informational and cultural outlets.</p>

                                communications has been the great expansion in the amount of data to
                                be handled—the so-called “information explosion.” This phenomenon
                                has seen the doubling of the amount of total information during the
                                past decade, with the prospects for another doubling in the next ten
                                years. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must be selective in
                                its information processing, emphasizing those areas which relate
                                most directly to its mission objectives. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must also be responsive to the new range and
                                complexity of information resources which are relevant to the

                                audiences but also in its technology. The dramatic current example
                                of this is the global communications satellite network, scheduled
                                for full operation in 1968. Less dramatic but equally significant
                                changes are taking place in other areas affecting Agency
                                operations—automated library techniques, computerized information
                                storage and teaching machines. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> operations should be adapted to take advantage of

                                    interests</hi>. In recent years, the balance of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> overseas operations has shifted
                                to countries where the major security problem is latent or active
                                insurgency. This shift has placed new demands on the Agency’s need
                                to identify more precisely its role in modernization and insurgency
                                operations and to adapt its own operations accordingly. In
                                particular, the Agency should examine its operations in the
                                following fields as they relate to insurgency situations: (1)
                                training officers in psychological operations for insurgency
                                situations, (2) improving the collection and use of intelligence
                                related to insurgencies, (3) improving its technological
                                capabilities for insurgency operations and (4) strengthening
                                indigenous organizations which have, directly or indirectly, a local
                                psychological-operations role, and (5) improving the Agency’s
                                capability to support overall U.S. Government policies and
                                operations relating to insurgency situations throughout the

                        <p>This memorandum transmits our study of the organization of the Bureau of
                            Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>Our findings and recommendations derive from the assumptions and guidance
                            given us, as set forth in Appendix 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> applied to the present structure
                            of the Bureau. We believe the recommendations to be feasible and
                            consistent with the assumptions. They will provide a tighter, more
                            responsive <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> organization to carry out
                            the Department’s upgraded responsibilities in international educational

                        <p>Some of the recommendations can be put into effect forthwith; others
                            depend on the outcome of interdepartmental negotiations that lie ahead.
                            Therefore, we foresee the proposed reorganization taking place by phases
                            over a span of time.</p>

                            <p>The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>) has not had continuity of
                                direction. Its program operations are isolated from the mainstream
                                of the conduct of foreign affairs.<note n="5" xml:id="d95fn5">An
                                    unknown hand underlined “isolated from” and drew two parallel
                                    lines in the left-hand margin next to this sentence.</note> The
                                program’s explicit legal authority (Public Law 87–256, the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> Act,<note n="6" xml:id="d95fn6">See <ref target="#d14fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                        14</ref>.</note> and previous legislation), a separate
                                appropriation, and the Department’s organizational structure have
                                contributed to this seclusion. The full program potential of
                                legislative authority has not been achieved.</p>
                            <p>The Bureau’s program operations are complicated. There are four
                                statutory boards and four other advisory groups which advise and
                                oversee elements of the program and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> provides them secretariat services. Management of
                                    <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s finances is intricate. The
                                organizational structure of the Bureau is cumbersome and fragmented.
                                Thirteen units report to the Assistant Secretary. All but the
                                smallest units are, in turn, subdivided and most offices are layered
                                with deputy and supervisory positions.<note n="7" xml:id="d95fn7">An

                            <p>The main thrust of this report is the transfer from the Department to
                                the Center for Educational Cooperation, <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>, of domestic operations of the academic exchange
                                    programs.<note n="8" xml:id="d95fn8">See <ref target="#d89fn3">footnote 3, Document 89</ref>.</note> Mechanisms are in
                                existence or can be created to assure the Department’s leadership
                                and coordinating role in the direction of the foreign relations
                                content of these programs. The result of the reorganization proposed
                                will be an upgraded, tighter <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>,
                                more responsive to foreign relations considerations.</p>
                            <p>This study proposes a mustering of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                                functions into three logical groupings: program operations, program
                                support, and coordination; each group of functions to be headed by a
                                Deputy Assistant Secretary. Within these groupings, functions of
                                subordinate units are clarified, <pb n="293" facs="0334" xml:id="pg_293"/>layers of supervision are eliminated, and the
                                number of positions is reduced. Through transfer of operations and
                                staff from the Bureau and the elimination of superfluous positions,
                                    <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> can be reduced by 63
                                positions.</p>
                            <p>The organization and staffing changes recommended in the following
                                sections are desirable and attainable goals, but the timing of their
                                accomplishment will depend in part on developments outside the
                                authority of the Bureau and the Department, e.g., the creation and
                                proper functioning of the Center for Educational Cooperation and the
                                ability to make necessary administrative and personnel changes.</p>

                                recommendations.]</p>

                            <p>It is recommended that:</p>

                                objectives in two separate areas.</p>

                                to positive themes set out in Plans I and II, we must, where it
                                would be helpful, rebut Gaullist charges against <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the U.S. A collection of the
                                principal charges with factual replies is at Tab III.</p>
                            <p>C. <hi rend="italic">General Considerations:</hi></p>
                            <p>1. Within France we wish to make a strong case for the views of the
                                U.S. and the 14 on <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and to
                                give the French people opportunity to understand the adverse effects
                                Gaullist <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> policies will have
                                on France. We wish also to rebut the arguments and allegations made
                                by Gaullist leaders against <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                                and the U.S. role in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>2. Among the 13, while we may agree on the broad policy goals
                                regarding the France/<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> crisis
                                we will shortly be confronted by major differences in view on
                                tactics. In this connection some of the 13 will wish for a variety
                                of reasons to go to unreasonable lengths to seek accommodations with
                                the French, and to gloss over or ignore the damage and problems
                                caused by the French actions.</p>
                            <p><pb n="296" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_296"/>3. It will be hard to
                                sustain steady American and general Allied interest in the crisis as
                                it stretches out and particularly as the issues before governments
                                become complicated, e.g. how <gloss target="#t_NAC_1">NAC</gloss>
                                should be reorganized.</p>
                            <p>4. Neither the Europeans nor we wish to see the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> crisis unnecessarily contaminate
                                other matters, e.g. we wish to avoid having the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> crisis foul up the European
                                Community and the Kennedy Round.<note n="9" xml:id="d96fn9">Reference is to the sixth session of the General Agreement on

                                friends in Europe should understand we will be firm on keeping
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> strong in the full
                                realization that in its absence neither the European Communities nor
                                the Kennedy Round could reach meaningful and enduring goals—for
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is fundamental to
                                both.</p>
                            <p>5. We do not wish the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> crisis
                                to affect France’s present role as one of the Allied Occupation

                                Speculation and comment relating France’s actions in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to its position in Berlin should
                                therefore be avoided. Moreover, in implementing our Information
                                Program concerning the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                                crisis, the U.S. Mission in Berlin will obviously need to bear in
                                mind the special importance in Berlin itself of maintaining
                                harmonious relationships with the French.</p>
                            <p>6. We wish to strengthen the incentive of the 13 to remain in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and vigorously support it—and
                                the French to return to it—by making their peoples feel that <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> can be further developed to
                                serve their common vital interests and such deeply felt desires as

                            <p>7. The programs both in and outside France must be carried out over
                                many months. Missions should, therefore, measure their activity
                                against public acceptance. They should plan ahead to use
                                developments in the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> situation

                        <p>1. Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> had long
                            discussion current situation re cultural exchanges with <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Kornienko</persName> at Spaso lunch July 19.</p>

                            it is in danger of doing thanks to Soviet actions. He referred to recent

                            tools exhibit scheduled to open August 1 in Kharkov. Visas had to be
                            issued and permission given for forwarding exhibit materials held up at
                            Soviet border. Amb <persName corresp="#p_KFD_1">Kohler</persName> noted
                            exchanges were just about all that was left that was not frozen into
                            immobility in U.S.-Soviet relations and thought it important they not be
                            allowed to dry up. He noted Exchanges Agreement had been signed only few
                            months ago and that nothing had changed in international field in
                            interim despite contrary Soviet claims. Furthermore, these exchanges
                            should be divorced from politics and continued on their merits. Even
                            from Kremlin’s point of view—which he tried to understand—contin<pb n="298" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_298"/>uation of broad program of
                            popular exchanges seemed consistent with distinction they always
                            professed to see between “ruling circles” and people.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> was neither very
                            specific nor very encouraging in his reply. He said we would get our
                            reply (presumably on hand tools exhibit) “rather soon” but general tenor
                            of his comments suggested we would not be pleased with reply. At one
                            point, he indicated exchange program would be carried out on a reduced
                            basis. He said that problem was being debated at present time with some
                            for and some against continuation. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> of course echoed <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>’s line that what happened in cultural field was
                            “up to you”. He insisted that such program could not be divorced from
                            political developments. In this connection, both <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KGM_1">Kornienko</persName> showed considerable
                            sensitivity to Ambassador’s charges Soviet Government directly
                            responsible for decision to cancel <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> sports meets.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> argued at some
                            length (but unconvincingly) that Soviet public opinion was responsible
                            for attitude of Soviet Government in this matter.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> said that every night
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> (Russian) very conveniently
                            totals up numbers of U.S. aircraft involved in raids over North Vietnam.
                            Soviet listeners, who remember very well Nazi bombings during World War
                            II, cannot but react with revulsion at such news. This is having
                            cumulative effect in slowly but surely drying up reservior of good will
                            toward U.S. which he did not deny existed there. <gloss target="#t_Amb_1">Amb</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KFD_1">Kohler</persName> commented that even if
                            this were the case, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has a policy of
                            telling the truth.</p>
                        <p>5. Comment: Seems clear to us <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>’s advanced recall on consultation connected
                            with this problem and as Dept will realize from above, he carefully
                            avoided committing self as to where he stood in debate over future of
                            exchanges.</p>

                        <p>In 334, the Embassy describes Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD_1">Kohler</persName>’s discussion of the exchanges program with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>. We had
                            earlier asked the Embassy to inform us whether the exhibit shipment had
                            reached Kharkov. The Embassy has not yet replied to that telegram. But,
                            in 334, the Ambassador is reported as telling <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> that the shipment is still at
                            the border. Since shipping time from the border to Kharkov runs between
                            a week and ten days, the exhibit could not reach Kharkov in time to
                            permit its setting-up, which would take four days at a minimum. It is
                            thus clear now that <hi rend="italic">Hand Tools</hi> cannot possibly
                            open as scheduled on August 1.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, there has still been no action on the telegram to Ambassador

                            the Secretary’s memorandum to the President.<note n="7" xml:id="d98fn7">In a July 19 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BFM_1">Bator</persName> described the July 19 <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> memorandum and the two

                            the Soviets are repeating the tired old script of last fall, according
                            to which they would eliminate what they don’t like, while keeping what
                            they do like, particularly the sending of scientific and technical
                            personnel to the U.S. In order to be able to block this, we must make
                            sure we get agreement to Alternative No. 1. If Alternative No. 2 is

                        <p>Withal, our posture re Viet-Nam must be founded on (1) our absolute and
                            continued determination resist aggression by Hanoi, (2) fact that Hanoi
                            simply cannot defeat U.S. and that North Vietnamese failure is
                            inevitable, (3) that peace equally inevitable but being delayed only by
                            Hanoi’s unwillingness thus far rpt thus far to come to negotiating table
                            and (4) that U.S. remains ready—indeed, eager—pursue cessation of
                            hostilities and road to lasting peace by unconditional negotiations at
                            any time and any place, as suggested so often by President and other
                            American officials. Your advice to Country Team and your ideas forwarded
                            to Washington should parallel this line of thought.</p>

                                both public and private, vary widely according to proximity to the
                                scene of action and domestic political and economic
                                considerations.</p>
                            <p>Vietnam seems far away and of little direct concern to most people.
                                In many countries, however, public opinion shows increasing concern,
                                reflecting in part the rising level of public controversy and debate
                                in the United States. A strong contributing factor is the generally
                                negative impact of international news media coverage, particularly
                                the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> wire services, <hi rend="italic">Agency France Presse</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The
                                    New York Times</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Paris Herald
                                    Tribune</hi>, and Walter Lippman,<note n="6" xml:id="d100fn6">American journalist, writer, and political commentator.</note>
                                which makes the Communist’s propaganda job easier.</p>
                            <p>Principal negative points include:</p>
                            <quote><p>1. The image of a huge white nation attempting to suppress an
                                    Asian struggle for freedom.</p>
                                <p>2. The image of the struggle as a civil war in South Vietnam.</p>
                                <p>3. The Viet Cong as embattled revolutionaries.</p>
                                <p>4. The military and non-representational character of the South
                                    Vietnamese government.</p></quote>
                            <p>On the plus side, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> peace
                                offensive has had a positive effect.</p>
                            <p>Opinions generally follow cold war alignments but most foreigners who
                                support the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> on other issues show
                                some serious doubts about aspects of Vietnam. Many government
                                officials are sympathetic in private but reluctant to show sympathy
                                in public. In the developing areas there is a general feeling that
                                the large <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> commitments in Vietnam
                                markedly subtract from possible <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                                aid to their countries. Opposition to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policies comes from influential groups including the
                                “intelligentsia,” university students, left-of-center political
                                parties and segments of organized labor, and is by no means limited
                                to those controlled or influenced by the Communists.</p>
                            <p>Recommendations for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy actions
                                stress the need for:</p>
                            <quote><p>1. greater persistence in identifying the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> as the seeker of peace;</p>
                                <p>2. more actions to multilateralize the efforts to resist
                                    aggression;</p>
                                <p>3. more public and diplomatic actions by Asians in support of the
                                    effort.</p></quote>
                            <p><pb n="305" facs="0346" xml:id="pg_305"/>Principal themes which
                                missions most frequently cite as helpful are:</p>
                            <quote><p>1. Economic and social progress as a principal <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> goal.</p>
                                <p>2. Emphasis on the role of South Vietnam in promoting economic
                                    and social progress, as well as in prosecuting the war.</p>
                                <p>3. Less emphasis on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military
                                    presence and actions wherever possible.</p>
                                <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is in Vietnam only to
                                    help the Government of South Vietnam repel aggression.</p>
                                <p>5. By meeting Communist aggression in Vietnam we are weakening
                                    the Communist potential to make trouble elsewhere and
                                    demonstrating that aggression does not pay.</p></quote>
                            <p>In the field of information activities, the survey confirms the
                                validity of the general direction of our present programming. The

                                present operations.</p>
                            <p>Judged particularly effective are:</p>

                                <p>2. the use of speakers—American, South Vietnamese and others,
                                    especially Asians—who have had direct observation or experience
                                    in Vietnam;</p>
                                <p>3. the views of respected, high-level public figures, presented
                                    in articles or books for selective <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> placement and in direct confrontation with
                                    critical or skeptical audiences.</p></quote>
                            <p>The missions particularly request:</p>
                            <quote><p>1. more material for use by all news media on the non-military
                                    aspects of the war, especially films;</p>
                                <p>2. more action by Asians, officially and non-officially, to tell
                                    the Vietnam story, even if this requires <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> financial support;</p>
                                <p>3. maximum precise information to justify any action which might
                                    be construed as intensifying or escalating the war, i.e., effect
                                    of <gloss target="#t_POL_1">POL</gloss> bombings, air strikes in

                        <p>In back of all post analyses and comment is an unexpressed leitmotif:
                            Europeans tend to think of the conflict as <hi rend="italic">a U.S.
                                war</hi> that is being carried on irrespective of the interests of
                            all the South Vietnemese and of Asians in general. The posts therefore
                            recommend a more international approach to our effort, in addition to
                            fresh U.S. presentations of our position. Also noted is a conviction
                            that photos and stories originating with U.S. wire services are almost
                            always detrimental to our cause.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> GENERAL
                            RECOMMENDATION:</p>
                        <p>We have increasing evidence, from our recent <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">No record of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> meeting has been
                                found.</note> onwards, that Europeans can understand the war and our
                            involvement better if they grasp the degree of our interests in the
                            Pacific area in general rather than in South Viet-Nam in particular.
                            With the President’s July 12 speech<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">In a
                                July 12 speech to the American Alumni Council, which <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> delivered from the White
                                House and was broadcast nationwide over both television and radio,
                                he stressed: “Asia is now the crucial arena of man’s striving for
                                independence and order, and for life itself. This is true because
                                three out of every five people in all this world live in Asia
                                tonight. This is true because hundreds of millions of them exist on
                                less than 25 cents a day. This is true because Communists in Asia
                                tonight still believe in force in order to achieve their Communist
                                goals. So if enduring peace can ever come to Asia, all mankind will
                                benefit. But if peace fails there, nowhere else will our
                                achievements really be secure.” For text of the speech, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book II, pp. 718–722.</note>
                            as a base, <gloss target="#t_IAE_1">IAE</gloss> would suggest that media
                            treatment to our area might be more effective if there were more
                            emphasis on our position in the Pacific as a whole. When Europeans
                            understand why we are there, to prevent repetition of what happened in
                            Asia in the 30’s, and to permit socio-economic progress, they might well
                            understand why we cannot leave. Sensitive as Europeans are about
                            potential withdrawals of troops and interests to advance our concerns
                            elsewhere, they are sophisticated enough, when fully informed, to <pb n="307" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_307"/>judge our presence in the
                            Pacific to be necessary by classical balance of power principles. They
                            should be reminded that the attack on SVN is but the latest in a long
                            series of post-war communist actions in the Far East (Malaya, the
                            Philippines, Korea, Laos). While SVN is not necessarily the ideal place
                            for us to make a stand, it is nevertheless the place where the stand
                            must be made. Should we withdraw, opportunity to make a stand elsewhere
                            under more favorable conditions would not be possible. Our presence and
                            performance in SVN are making possible constructive developments
                            throughout the Far East and South East Asia; our withdrawal could only
                            advance the interests of Peking and Hanoi throughout the area.
                            Ultimately, that would create a situation even more detrimental to our
                            ability to maintain our European commitments.</p>

                            seem worthy of pursuit:</p>

                        <p>1. Expand the number of backgrounders given by the President and the
                            Secretaries of State and Defense to individual European correspondents.
                            These should be off-the-record private talks rather than exclusive
                            interviews. The correspondents should be selected among those who write
                            unsympathetically about the conflict.</p>
                        <p>2. Assign experienced <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers to
                            the ‘P’ staff in each area at State so that contacts can be increased
                            with Washington-based correspondents from overseas. Many attitudes
                            abroad are determined by what correspondents report from Washington;
                            these correspondents <pb n="308" facs="0349" xml:id="pg_308"/>are likely
                            to report more accurately, and sympathetically, if they are seen
                            regularly by informed Americans.</p>
                        <p>3. Increase the number of European correspondents and <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss> teams who are sent on special trips to
                            Viet-Nam, including popular magazine writers and editors of student
                            newspapers. This increase might be pegged to the upcoming September
                            elections. It would be ideal if the South Vietnamese could invite them.
                            (Austria, Germany)</p>
                        <p>4. Explore use of Italian film on the conflict for possible worldwide
                            placement on <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>. (Italy)</p>
                        <p>5. Explore use of Canadian film on non-military aspects of South Viet-Nam
                            today for possible worldwide placement on <gloss target="#t_TV_1">TV</gloss>. (Canada)</p>
                        <p>6. Explore possibility of a film on multi-national aid programs to South
                            Viet-Nam. (Norway)</p>
                        <p>7. Arrange for more Asian leaders to make public statements in Europe on
                            their understanding of the conflict. The British, for example, will
                            hearken to what the Australians and New Zealanders say. (Germany)</p>
                        <p>8. Arrange for returning Vietnamese leaders and students to stop off in
                            Europe on the way back home from the U.S. It is not necessary for these
                            people to make talks and become ‘spokesmen.’ Lunches and informal groups
                            in which they are included would be useful to our posts.</p>
                        <p>9. Suggest that a prominent British scholar on Far East like P. J.

                        <p>Responses have been coming in from all over the world to a State/<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Circular asking for analyses of
                            local attitudes toward the Vietnam conflict and recommendations
                            concerning how Washington can improve its output. I think one or two
                            responses are particularly worth calling to your attention.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bowles’ response is the best I have read. After reviewing the
                            local situation concerning Indian attitudes toward Vietnam, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCB_1">Bowles</persName> quickly reports on
                            the measures he has taken in New Delhi to get our position across. He
                            has done a lot. But his ideas about what we ought to do here in
                            Washington are, perhaps, more pertinent.</p>
                        <p>He calls for a maximum emphasis on the efforts of the South Vietnamese
                            Army and a playdown of the role of our forces. He strongly urges an even
                            greater effort to publicize the positive efforts being made by the
                            Vietnamese and Americans to improve the life of the people, to bring
                            about social and political progress, etc.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB_1">Bowles</persName> thinks we can
                            improve reporting on the actual fighting by developing ways “less likely
                            to strike adverse emotional chords.” The daily concentration on killing
                            is what he had in mind. He emphasizes the harm done by photographs; they
                            are “extremely costly.”</p>
                        <p>He calls for more emphasis on the bloody terroristic actions against
                            villagers and civilians by the Communists and their attacks against
                            economic growth, social reform, and political progress.</p>
                        <p>His next point is even more interesting. He calls for greater emphasis on
                            the role of the Chinese. He says the war is an uneven contest, as it is
                            now being reported, between the most powerful nations in the world and a
                            tiny nation of farmers in North Vietnam. He would use the presence of
                            the Chinese in North Vietnam, as well as their inflexibility against
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>He would stress our treatment of POW’s in contrast with Hanoi’s.</p>
                        <p><pb n="310" facs="0351" xml:id="pg_310"/>In backgrounders, he thinks we
                            should be far tougher about the Soviet failure to seek peace. He would
                            create doubts about the Soviet desire for peace. While the Soviets
                            denounce the Chinese as reckless dogmatists, they are in fact Peking’s
                            captives: China tells Hanoi what to do, then Hanoi tells the Russians
                            what to do. Skepticism of the Soviet bona fides is needed. “The point
                            should be driven home over and over again that <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> have taken no tangible steps
                            toward a peaceful solution.”</p>
                        <p>We should stress relentlessly our continued efforts for a political
                            solution. Next he wants illustrated feature articles in simple language
                            stressing the massive economic development that can begin immediately
                            after hostilities.</p>
                        <p>We should reiterate our support for a peace agreement that satisfies the
                            governments of both South and North Vietnam, lessening the notion that
                            this is an American war. He would somehow mute the emphasis on bombing
                            which he feels underscores the notion that the basic contest is between
                            big Uncle Sam and little Ho Chi Minh.</p>
                        <p>He thinks it is very important to avoid bombing civilian centers. He
                            thinks hundreds of millions of people around the world admire the way
                            the North Vietnamese are standing up to the bombing attacks. He would
                            couple these attacks with their objective: to bring Hanoi to the peace
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Moving away from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB_1">Bowles</persName>’ notions, the next best paper is from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJD_1">Jim Bell</persName> in Malaysia. He
                            points out that the Government of Malaysia continues its broad support
                            for the United States in Vietnam. He reminds us that the Foreign
                            Minister has recently publicly stated that South Vietnam would have
                            fallen to Communist aggression if the United States had failed. Since
                            the bombing the Malaysians have been more careful. Even so, the Foreign
                            Ministry is preparing a White Paper to discuss the general power
                            equation in Asia and why Malaysia must continue to support our effort in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BJD_1">Jim Bell</persName> thinks it is vital for
                            Asian audiences to get across the absolute fact that we will remain in
                            Vietnam until our objectives are achieved. Despite the President’s
                            speeches some Malaysians still question that we will stick and not
                            weary.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJD_1">Bell</persName> is also worried
                            about the war looking white versus yellow. To correct this distortion he
                            would send small groups of carefully selected Vietnamese students to
                            Asian countries to explain the South Vietnamese fight for freedom. In
                            reverse, he would invite Malaysian students to South Vietnam to areas
                            outside Saigon, avoiding all Americans.</p>
                        <p>He wants more personalized attention to editors, politicians, officials,
                            and professors on the part of our Embassy officials. He thinks <pb n="311" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_311"/>that each American overseas
                            should send personal notes to contacts, including useful articles and
                            speeches of high quality. The audiences he has in mind are in
                            policy-forming or influential positions.</p>
                        <p>He is worried about the extensive publicity given to body counts, number
                            of tons of bombs dropped, etc., all of which tend to overshadow the
                            “economic and social aspect of the U.S. effort which news media often
                            ignore . . . serious consideration should be given to releasing only
                            bi-weekly or monthly summaries of detailed statistics on casualties,
                            etc.”</p>
                        <p>He would like a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> film totally
                            devoted to economic and social programs in Vietnam. He would like a
                            series produced on a continuing basis. He says the best effort in
                            Malaysia last year on behalf of South Vietnam was a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>-produced movie, “Night of [the]
                                Dragon,”<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">See <ref target="#d71fn4">footnote 4, Document 71</ref>.</note> shown on commercial
                            circuits and television. He thinks MGM or Paramount ought to produce
                            full-length films of that caliber for commercial showing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BJD_1">Jim Bell</persName> calls for more
                            consultation among the Allies to listen, to ponder, to measure the real
                            feelings of ordinary men and women in Asia, quoting the <hi rend="italic">Straits Times</hi>.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">One of
                                the leading newspapers in Singapore, founded in 1845.</note> To
                            increase Asian involvement he would recommend personal correspondence by
                            the President or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>
                            to Asian leaders requesting their suggestions. He suggests visits by me
                            or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> to Malaysia,
                            Singapore, Burma, and possibly Laos, not previously or recently visited.
                            He would use these visits to explore views of Asian leaders not
                            previously consulted. He suggests a conference of Asian and U.S.
                            intellectuals, maybe at the East-West Center, to seek Asian views.</p>

                            in Vietnam is delegated to the Director, <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>. This responsibility is applicable to all U.S.

                        <p>Recently some reports have reached me regarding lack of understanding of
                            the educational exchange programs of the Department of State (<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>) on the part of some Public Affairs
                            Officers and Cultural Affairs Officers. I believe these reports may be
                            based on inadequate information or poor communication, but the fact that
                            such misunderstanding may exist is a matter of serious concern to
                            me.</p>
                        <p>I am therefore writing this letter to make my views clear.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> post abroad is responsible for
                            administering the programs of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                            Affairs in the field. I expect the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>—who has overall responsibility for both <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> functions—and the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>—to whom operating responsibility for the latter is
                            generally delegated—to discharge these responsibilities with as much
                            understanding, insight, and knowledge as they bring to their conduct of
                            the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> program.</p>
                        <p>I expect other <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> officers to have a
                            good general knowledge of the nature and purposes of the exchange
                            programs, and as much specific information as their position
                            requires.</p>
                        <p>I particularly wish to call to your attention the role of the Board of
                            Foreign Scholarships as specified in the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName>
                            Act of 1961 (P. L. 87–256), which is the legislative authority for the
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs.<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">The Board of Foreign Scholarships, also known as
                                the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">J. William Fulbright</persName>
                                Foreign Scholarship Board, was established by the U.S. Congress to
                                oversee the worldwide <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> Program as authorized by the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> Act. The Mutual Education and
                                Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 expanded the Board’s authority. The
                                Board was, and continues to be, responsible for setting policy for
                                the Academic Exchange Program under the Act and oversees the
                                program.</note> Under this Act the Board has the statutory
                            responsibility for supervising the academic programs authorized by the
                            Act, as well as for the selection of the academic grantees. The policies
                            of the Board are thus binding on all those who administer the academic
                            programs—on <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in Washington and on
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in the field.</p>
                        <p>In the 48 countries where a Binational Commission has been established by
                            agreement of the United States and the host government, it <pb n="315" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_315"/>is the policy of the Board of Foreign
                            Scholarships that the Commission program be truly binational in
                            character. Needless to say, the responsible officers should be guided by
                            this policy, both in its letter and in its spirit.</p>
                        <p>While the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> programs are closely related and
                            mutually supporting, each has its own philosophy, objectives, statutory
                            basis and method of operation. I expect <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers to carry out their responsibilities for both
                            programs with due regard for the special characteristics of each.</p>
                        <p>Although I am sure you have all read the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName>

                        <p>In his February 2, 1966, special message to Congress proposing an
                            international education and health program, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon Johnson</persName> urged Congress to pass
                            his proposed International Education Act because “Education lies at the
                            heart of every nation’s hopes and purposes. It must be at the heart of
                            our international relations.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                            I, page 128) On August 17, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational
                            and Cultural Affairs <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Charles
                                Frankel</persName> testified before the Senate Subcommittee on
                            Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare in support of the
                            President’s proposed International Education Act. <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> enumerated several reasons why
                            the proposed legislation was important: “It offers a better chance to
                            American citizens to acquire the education they need to cope with the
                            facts of international life. It strengthens the American capacity to
                            develop, to conduct, and to man informed and farsighted policies in
                            international affairs. It takes steps that are essential if our Nation
                            is to join with other nations in a more intensive effort to educate the
                            people of the world in habits of mutual understanding and forbearance.
                            Finally, it is important because it makes a frontal attack on a
                            fundamental issue in the relation between Government and the
                            universities, and attempts to deal with this issue from a long-term
                            rather than a short-term point of view.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> stressed the importance to
                            Americans on having an international affairs perspective in their
                            education, but he noted that beyond <pb n="316" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_316"/>this, the proposed legislation and its emphasis on
                            education as part of U.S. foreign policy was also vital: “In the
                            developing nations, little can be accomplished without the advancement
                            of education. In the more prosperous industrial nations, education is
                            the keystone on which depends these nations’ power to keep up with the
                            accelerating pace of change. In our own country, as we have discovered,
                            we must turn to education again and again as an indispensable element in
                            the solution of pressing social problems. In short, the role of
                            educational systems in 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>-century
                            societies is immense. Working together, rather than against each other,
                            these educational systems have as much power as any human agency to
                            build an international structure of peace in diversity. The legislation
                            that is before you proposes that we in this country prepare ourselves to
                            do our part in such an effort at international education cooperation.
                            And it proposes that we begin here at home by educating ourselves better
                            about the needs and aspirations of others.” <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> continued: “In sum, from the standpoint of
                            foreign policy, I endorse this proposed legislation because it lays the

                                The meeting took place at the Department of State. There is no
                                indication as to the time of the meeting. No drafting information
                                appears on the minutes. The President’s General Advisory Committee
                                on Foreign Assistance Programs (GAC) was established by Presidential
                                Directive under authority granted by Public Law 88–206, dated
                                December 16, 1963, to advise the President, the Secretaries of State
                                and Defense, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, the
                                Administrator of the Agency for International Development and other
                                departments and agencies on issues of policy and on the
                                implementation of foreign assistance programs. The GAC was convened
                                for the first time on March 26, 1965. For additional information

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> welcomed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> and asked him to proceed with any statements he
                            had for the Committee. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that he would like
                            first to give some background on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,
                            so that the Committee might appreciate <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s problems in trying to carry out the mission assigned
                            to it.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had been Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> since September 1, 1965. In the past, he said, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> had been buffeted at times by
                            Congress due <pb n="318" facs="0359" xml:id="pg_318"/>to a lack of
                            appreciation and a misunderstanding of its function. On the
                            appropriations side, he said he found a particularly difficult
                            situation. In the past there have been peaks, when there was need for
                            expansion and large amounts of money were appropriated and strenuous
                            recruiting activities undertaken; these periods have been followed by
                            valleys in the appropriations, necessitating letting people go. It has
                            been difficult to maintain an organization with the kind of adjustments
                            which such circumstances called for. In September, 1965 the House
                            Appropriations Committee appropriated $150,241,000 for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. This level would maintain the
                            agency’s operations at substantially the same level as the previous two
                            years, despite the growth of its activities around the world. However,
                            there is a tendency in the Senate to reduce the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> program in Western Europe on the
                            theory that Western Europe is an area where everybody knows what is
                            going on in the United States. The Senate Appropriations Committee,
                            accordingly, proposed to cut the portion of the agency’s appropriation
                            for Europe from $8 million to $4 million. He said that he interceded
                            with those members of the Senate Appropriations Committee he knew and
                            asked them not to make any cuts at least until he, as the new Director,
                            could determine the agency’s status, and assured them that if he felt
                            savings could be made, they would be made. In the end, the Senate
                            Appropriations Committee rounded off the appropriations at $150 million,
                            saying that $241,000 should be taken from Western Europe.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> staffs embassies in 105 countries
                            with information specialists trained in the various communications media
                            of the world. They advise ambassadors and other members of the Country
                            Team on how best to present the information side of United States
                            programs. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a minimum
                            complement of 12,000 people, which had been considerably greater in some
                            previous years. It operates in 218 localities in 106 countries. Roughly,
                            one-third of the 12,000 personnel works in the U.S. Local employees
                            overseas account for about 60% of total employment. The job of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is not to make foreign policy nor to
                            establish the principles on which the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> programs are based, but rather to explain and interpret
                            the operations of the United States overseas.</p>
                        <p>Information programs can be carried out in two different ways: the story
                            can be told by giving the bare facts or an attempt can be made to
                            explain and persuade. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does both.
                            When the President or any of his leading officers makes a statement in
                            connection with United States programs, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> disseminates that statement as the first part of its
                            function. This dissemination takes place in a variety of ways. Every day
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> sends to each of the American
                            Embassies a minimum of 10,000 words and in some cases as much as 15,000
                            words reporting on what takes place in the United States affecting their
                            operations. Separate reports are sent to Latin America, the Far East,
                            Africa, and <pb n="319" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_319"/>other areas of the
                            world. This is known as the wireless file and is an essential element in
                            keeping Ambassadors informed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said many Ambassadors had told him that it is the
                            only reliable, authoritative link which they have with Washington other
                            than the official cables which go back and forth. The information
                            officer rewrites the wireless file material in the language of his
                            particular country or in a form which may be more useable, and then
                            takes it to editors, radio stations, and television stations for
                            distribution. This is the basis, we hope, on which that country will
                            find out about what the United States is doing. As countries become more
                            sophisticated, it takes greater ingenuity to have them use this
                            material. In the great majority of cases, however, this is not true. The
                            newspapers in most countries are hardly papers of general circulation
                            and vary greatly in quality.</p>
                        <p>Probably the most publicized of various <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media is the Voice of America. The <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has a responsibility to inform its
                            listeners and to keep their interest. This cannot be done just by having
                            news hour after hour, and expecting to hold an audience in competition
                            with other broadcasters of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to have
                            music, drama, and a diversified program schedule which will keep the
                            listeners tuned in, so that they will hear the news and the commentary
                            as well. The commentary and the news suddenly have become recognized in
                            the United States as authoritative and reliable. In the past, there had
                            been much criticism (some of it from people who had never heard a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> program), but, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said, he felt the Voice of
                            America has always been a credible medium, ever since it was created in
                            1948. It tells the bad as well as the good and it hopes to put in
                            perspective what happens in the United States—that we are not a perfect
                            society, but we strive for perfection; that we do have riots in some
                            places today, but at the same time tremendous progress has been made in
                            the civil rights field.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts regularly in 38
                            languages, 845 hours per week. That is not the greatest amount of
                            broadcasting done in the competitive broadcasting field. Russia
                            broadcasts about 1100 hours, Radio Peking about the same, and the United
                            Arab Republic about 800 hours. However, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> has one device that none of its competitors can match.
                            It makes tape recordings of news, commentary, and programs which will
                            explain U.S. objectives and U.S. activities, and then takes them to the
                            managers of radio stations in foreign countries for broadcasting on
                            their networks. Thus, when a listener in a foreign country tunes in his
                            local radio station, he is liable to hear a <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> program just as he hears his local commentator. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> places weekly 15,000 hours of radio
                            programs on the local stations of the world. Approximately 11,000 of the
                            15,000 hours are placed in Latin American countries. In addition, when
                            there is a major event, such as a space shot, hundreds of radio <pb n="320" facs="0361" xml:id="pg_320"/>stations in Latin America will
                            take the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> program intact from short
                            wave and play it over their domestic systems.</p>
                        <p>A third medium, which is developing rapidly, is television. It ranges
                            from 85 to 90% circulation in Japan to 800 sets in Ghana, for example,
                            but every nation in the world today either has television or is getting
                            television facilities. It is easier to list the approximately 18
                            countries which do not have it than it is to list the nearly 100 who do
                            have television facilities.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> makes films<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">See, for example, <hi rend="italic">U.S.A.

                            which it takes to the television stations for showing to local
                            audiences. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs are being
                            shown today in approximately 68 countries on a regular basis. As with
                            the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> tapes, these films deal in many
                            instances with the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program. They
                            relate to accomplishments in space, assistance to underdeveloped
                            countries, programs describing American schools, and efforts being made
                            to rehabilitate the economy and people of Vietnam. In short, films are
                            used in the same way as the other media to tell the story. Last year,
                            2,082 television stations in 94 countries used <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films, and the same films also are used in theaters.
                            Based on surveys, these <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> films
                            have a regular audience of 350 million people in 120 countries.
                            Statistically, this figure includes news releases which also are made by
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and provided to local
                            theaters and television.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said he wished to
                            discuss the propaganda effort of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.
                            He said it is necessary to define the word “propaganda” because no
                            matter how sophisticated people are, the word “propaganda” has sinister
                            overtones. There is an attitude, even among some members of the
                            Congress, that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is a propaganda
                            medium and that its product somehow or other doesn’t ring true. He said
                            that he had done a great deal of research to determine a consistent
                            definition of propaganda and has concluded that each author has his own
                            concept which he tailors for the end result he wants to achieve. He said
                            the day he took office as Director he stated that his philosophy was
                            that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would be a propaganda
                            agency, but truth would be its propaganda. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> tells the truth because in the American society there
                            is nothing to conceal. There is a great deal of which to be proud, and
                            furthermore the U.S. has no colonial aspirations and is not trying to
                            subjugate any people. If the truth can simply be known, it will be
                            adequate propaganda for the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Another area of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> activity is the
                            production of pamphlets. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> puts out
                            millions of pamphlets each year on topics germane to the United States;
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> projects provide a great deal
                            of the material used in this way. These pamphlets are available in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> field offices overseas, are
                            distributed to schools, and in some cases are used as teaching materials
                            in universities and colleges.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> maintains 223 libraries overseas.
                            These have gained notoriety from the numerous incidents which have taken
                            place at them. He <pb n="321" facs="0362" xml:id="pg_321"/>noted,
                            however, that those protests are usually well organized by the communist
                            groups. In eastern European countries, it was noted recently that the
                            cameras arrived 30 minutes before the rioters and that the police stood
                            by until the demonstration had taken place, and then they broke it up.
                            This is not a protest against anything which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is doing as much as it is a government to government
                            activity where there is resentment and a feeling that the other
                            government has to make world headlines by protesting.</p>
                        <p>Textbooks also are a valuable tool. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            prints textbooks and distributes them throughout the world. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> uses them in some fields, teaching
                            English through binational centers in Latin America and through regular
                            courses in other parts of the world. The concept of the binational
                            center is a very sound one; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said that he was most anxious to increase the
                            number of them. The binational center is a corporation, run by a board
                            of directors consisting of an equal number of Americans and locals.
                            These men form a society for the purpose of teaching English and charge
                            a fee for enrollment. The teaching of English is to the advantage of the
                            U.S. because when a person becomes exposed to the English language he
                            can read <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> publications, he can
                            understand its films, can listen to the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and becomes one who will more readily accept U.S. ideas
                            than if he had a remote language and no knowledge of English.</p>
                        <p>The binational centers in Latin America really have become little
                            universities. For example, in Lima, 11,000 students are studying English
                            at the binational center. In addition, there are seminars and libraries
                            and films. In Mexico City, there are 8,000 students at the binational
                            center. The binational foundation is an institution that is rapidly
                            spreading throughout Latin America. In many cases they are operating at
                            a breakeven point, with the instructor and the materials supplied by
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Many of them on the other
                            hand have realized substantial income and own their own buildings. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said that he is trying
                            to persuade the Congress to recognize that the institution of binational
                            centers is one of the most valuable things that the U.S. has in its
                            information and education programs because it is not peculiarly or
                            particularly a U.S. institution. It has great favor because prominent
                            businessmen and industrialists of the host country are on the board and
                            it becomes a local institution which carries out the mutual objectives
                            of the two countries. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has asked
                            for $1 million in its <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 67
                            appropriation to assist in helping binational centers improve their
                            physical facilities.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">On <hi rend="italic">October 20</hi>, 1966, the Congress voted an appropriation of

                            connection that it has now become increasingly clear overseas that the
                            chances of having a major modern university turn almost directly on
                            having courses in an international language, of which English is now the
                            preferred one because of American mastery of technology. University
                            people throughout the world are increasingly concerned that their
                            students have English as a second language because only in this way can
                            they attract English-speaking faculty, and only in this way can they
                            really have any chance of modernizing themselves. For example, the Dutch
                            are now thinking of setting up a graduate school in which all courses
                            would be taught in English. The Japanese universities are moving to a
                            point where they are becoming bilingual, not because they particularly
                            like English, but because this is their only way of attracting
                            English-speaking faculty, without whom they feel they don’t have a
                            chance of becoming modern universities. To a lesser extent, one could
                            settle for French because he could then go to some of the major French
                            universities, but for the next foreseeable period of time, the only
                            chance that universities around the world, outside of Russia and China,
                            can become really modernized, depends upon how quickly their students
                            learn English as their second language. Thus, a very direct causal
                            connection can be made between the mastery of English as a second
                            language and the chances of ever training indigenous personnel in modern
                            technology.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi>
                            said that he had been gratified to receive a report recently that the
                            University of Leyden, outside of Amsterdam, is starting a course in
                            American studies, staffed with American professors. The <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> cultural affairs officer in Holland
                            had been very active in creating this interest through the cultural
                            program of the State Department, which brought an outstanding Dutch
                            historian to this country for several months who, upon his return, wrote
                            a textbook which is a major one in its field now. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> assisted by providing photographs
                            and research materials for the book.</p>
                        <p>At the risk of over-simplification he would say that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has two weapons at its disposal that
                            no other country in the competitive broadcasting field has. The U.S. has
                            a food surplus for the time being, and the English language. The English
                            language is the key because it opens up doors to scientists, social
                            workers, and other people who have a curiosity about what is going on in
                            advanced societies. This has been recognized by Russia which is
                            distributing books throughout Latin America and other parts of the
                            world, books in English. There are very few courses in Russian which are
                            sponsored by the Russian cultural institutions throughout the world.
                            They tried it and it didn’t work. For example, a very ambitious program
                            was undertaken in the <gloss target="#t_UAR_1">UAR</gloss>, but it
                            failed. He said he is anxious, therefore, that the program of English
                            language teaching and textbook distribution be strengthened <pb n="323" facs="0364" xml:id="pg_323"/>because these are invaluable devices
                            for carrying out the rest of the U.S. objectives.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> said that there are tides running against
                            what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> had been talking
                            about which should be kept in mind. Rising nationalism is something the
                            United States has found very advantageous in dealing with countries in
                            the perimeters around China and Russia. However, one of its consequences
                            is an interest in promoting local language differences; for example,
                            there is strong pressure in India now for the development of various
                            Indian languages as opposed to English. This tendency appears even in
                            advanced countries; for example, in Belgium, the universities which had
                            been French and Flemish are now abolishing French. Everything has to be
                            in Flemish now, which means that 75% of the faculty will have to leave
                            in a year. In the Philippines, one cannot help but view with alarm the
                            increasing interest in Tagalog as a means of communication as opposed to
                            Spanish or English. Thus, in addition to pointing out the positive
                            advantages of English teaching, one ought to mention also that it is
                            increasingly important because nationalistic tides cut right across
                            everything else the U.S. is trying to do.</p>

                            and Broadcasting in India, prior to becoming Prime Minister, she asked

                            help remedy the decline of English in India. This has been accelerated
                            by the withdrawal by the British of their principal officers. He said
                            that perhaps after the elections in India, in February 1967, there will
                            be an opportunity to help with this.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the relationship between <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said that it is
                            necessary to distinguish among the areas of the world where <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> operates. For example, in Africa and
                            parts of Asia, the literacy rates range as low as 5% to 15% of the
                            population. Higher literacy rates generally prevail in Latin America.
                            With minimum literacy, it is not possible to use the tools of books or
                            pamphlets. One must rely more on films, television, and radio.</p>
                        <p>In Latin America, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has found that
                            it could dramatize the work the United States is doing as a good
                            neighbor under the Alliance for Progress most effectively through
                                films.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">See <ref target="#d68fn2">footnote 2, Document 68</ref>.</note> For example, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> sponsored a series of 26 half-hour
                            programs which it produced in Mexico in Spanish to tell the story of the
                            Alliance for Progress. The program is called <hi rend="italic">Nuestro
                                Barrio</hi>, set in a typical working class neighborhood of a large
                            unnamed Latin American city. Its format consists of a series of dramatic
                            episodes involving various people whose lives are in some <pb n="324" facs="0365" xml:id="pg_324"/>way affected by the barrio. In the

                            depict good and bad persons, young doctors, teachers, students, and
                            trade unionists, and within this framework the characters face and solve
                            a wide range of socio-economic problems, each of which illustrates some
                            goal of the Alliance for Progress. By applying the principles of the
                            Alliance, the people of the barrio learn the value of self-help, the
                            need to educate illiterates, the benefits of free labor unions,
                                etc.<note n="6" xml:id="d106fn6">See Monthly Newsletter No. 15 dated
                                September 1, 1966. [Footnote is in the original.]</note> The program
                            has acquired a remarkably faithful audience throughout the
                            Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America.</p>
                        <p>This illustrates the point that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            uses all of the tools available; in cases of highly illiterate
                            populations the drama of film is employed, whereas for college students
                            pamphlets, seminars, and books are used. The cartoon book, the picture
                            story, is a very effective tool, particularly in Latin America where,
                            since 1961, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has printed about 15
                            million comic books which are distributed throughout this area.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that since the
                            beginning of the book program in 1950, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has published 122 million copies of 13,000 book
                            titles. This runs at the rate of about 5 to 6 million copies a year. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName></hi> asked if this included Vietnam, which,
                            he learned during a recent visit to Saigon, was receiving approximately
                            14 million copies a year. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that the book
                            publication program in Vietnam is run by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, not <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. The two
                            agencies work closely together, but there is no real overlap.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> to deal with the role <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> plays with respect to other U.S. Government agencies.
                                <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that a number of years ago, in order to
                            avoid duplication of effort, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was
                            given the role of information officer for all foreign service activities
                            for all government agencies dealing in overseas work. With the single
                            exception of the military, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is the
                            information arm of the entire U.S. Government overseas. If the
                            Department of Agriculture or <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has a
                            particular publication or program which it wishes to publicize abroad,
                            it provides the material to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> which
                            tells the story. In some countries, where the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program is substantial, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has full-time officers devoted to nothing but <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> work. The best illustration of
                            cooperation comes in Vietnam where <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>,
                            State Department, Department of Defense and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> work together in a Joint United States Public Affairs
                            Office. Through a coordinated effort, all of the information work <pb n="325" facs="0366" xml:id="pg_325"/>is being carried on by that
                            office. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has 100 Americans
                            assigned to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> to describe how <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will work with the new educational officers from
                                <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>, and also how it works with the

                            coordination is somewhat baffling. The International Education Act<note n="7" xml:id="d106fn7">See <ref target="#d89fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 89</ref>.</note> provides for the establishment of
                            education officers in American Embassies overseas, whose role will be to
                            work with the universities in counselling students and to work with the
                            university administrations in creating curricula. This will be
                            essentially at the university level, although in some countries it may
                            involve the secondary school level as well. The educational officer will
                            be an employee of the Department of State and will work for and report
                            to the Ambassador; he will cooperate with the cultural affairs officer
                            who is a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employee. He will work
                            with the information officer, who also is a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> employee. His role will not be to disseminate
                            information and to deal with the public; he will deal primarily with the
                            university element. He will have the normal liaison with all education
                            activities, but will be on the payroll of the State Department and
                            report to the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural
                            Affairs. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Ryan</persName></hi> noted that this proposal is still in the
                            planning stage. It provides for recruitment of these officers by <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss> and placement as State Department
                            reserve officers. They are supposed to have a coordinating function for
                            all educational activities, including <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and the State
                            Department, and they also will have a coordinating relationship with the
                            science attache at the Embassy. It will not be an operating program, but
                            will be an advisory type of activity.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in the State Department
                            arranges for private U.S. citizens to travel abroad as representatives
                            of the U.S., sponsored by the Department of State. When they arrive in a
                            foreign country, they are taken over by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> which schedules and sets up the program for them in
                            that country. This is an arrangement that has been underway since 1953
                            on a cooperative basis.</p>
                        <p>With respect to <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> handles all of the information for
                            publicizing <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> projects. It receives
                            the information from <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and publicizes
                            it through the various media. <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> asked how <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> handles the distribution of
                            textbooks, which he noted seems to go somewhat beyond the dissemination
                            of information. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Ryan</persName></hi> explained that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> distributes and publishes textbooks in many countries
                            on behalf of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>. In some countries,
                            where there is a surplus of local currency, <pb n="326" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_326"/><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> handles the
                            production and distribution of textbooks largely because it was the only
                            U.S. agency involved in those countries when the original agreements
                            were signed. In other countries, where there is no <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program, but where there is a textbook
                            program, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> also is the operating
                            agency. In general, however, textbook programs in support of
                            developmental projects are funded through <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and are part of the related <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> project. That is why <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is not involved, except in India and two or three
                            other places, in the textbook program below the university level. In
                            other countries, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is in the
                            textbook business for university textbooks in the ideological field in
                            support of changing attitudes toward political development, which is a
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> function.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZWJ_1">Zellerbach</persName></hi> asked how the activities of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> were publicized within the United
                            States. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> itself handles any public information in the United
                            States because the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is restricted
                            by legislation to overseas activities.<note n="8" xml:id="d106fn8">Reference is to the <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MKE_1">Mundt</persName>

                            This reflects, he said, part of the concept that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is primarily a propaganda agency and
                            that people in the United States do not need to know what it is doing.
                                <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWS_1">Gaud</persName></hi> said that <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            has only a relatively few people who work on public information; there
                            are less than 40 people in its central information staff and about 10 to
                            15 on separate staffs set up for the Alliance for Progress and Vietnam.
                            He noted that until several years ago, the legislation governing
                            administration of the foreign assistance program included the Dworshak
                            Amendment, which prohibited the expenditure of funds in the United
                            States to publicize the activities of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program.<note n="9" xml:id="d106fn9">Reference is to

                            supposedly is part of the domestic interest of the United States.
                            However, if <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> were to undertake

                            but also reporting back to the President and senior <pb n="327" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_327"/>government officials on the
                            implications of foreign opinion with respect to U.S. policies and
                            programs. He noted that this has become increasingly important with
                            respect to Vietnam, and asked how this portion of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s responsibility is carried out. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi>
                            said that he sits as a member of the National Security Council and has
                            the responsibility to report whenever the Council considers projects
                            involving any aspects of foreign opinion. He said he operates according
                            to the principle that the U.S. should do what is best for the United
                            States, not what is best for foreign opinion. Foreign opinion is taken
                            into consideration, but the decision must be what is in the true
                            interest of the United States. Consistent with that responsibility, he
                            said, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> analyzes the foreign press
                            comment and reports from field officers on communist activities. They
                            take into account the local mores and the sensitivities of populations
                            to particular activities of the United States. This advisory function
                            also is carried on through direct relationships with the Department of
                            State, the Department of Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission and the
                            Department of Agriculture. The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            Research Service constantly studies developments taking place in
                            individual countries; when there is something relevant to agriculture,
                            defense, or any other government agency dealing in the given country, it
                            is reported to the agency concerned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> asked whether or not aid to a country might

                            said it is his job to inform the Administrator of the facts and let him
                            take them into consideration in reaching his overall judgment. It would
                            be the decision of the Administrator as to whether economic aid has a

                            country than the particular parochial problems with which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> might be concerned.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName></hi> noted that the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> statute requires that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> be kept advised of its activities; he asked if <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> knows what <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is doing? <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> replied that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> receives reports on intelligence
                            matters from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and that both agencies
                            sit on the National Security Council. Estimates made by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> are made available to him, he said,
                            although <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does not work with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> on any operational matters.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Professor <persName corresp="#p_MFS_1">Mason</persName></hi> said that the Committee had been discussing

                            and asked what line <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> takes in
                            dealing with this question. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that there is no
                            general line established—that each particular <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> project must be tailormade. The project must be related
                            to the country’s economy and to its development. He said it would not be
                            very useful to talk in Latin America about the overall U.S. aid
                            objectives in Southeast Asia. Thus, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does not attempt in a general way to explain an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> philosophy, but it does deal with this

                            agreed with his recommendation that the communications program there be
                            increased. He said that he intended to stress before the Congressional
                            Appropriations Committee the importance of Latin America in the overall
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> program. That is one area
                            where <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must strengthen its
                            resources. The Alliance for Progress is probably one of the single most
                            important programs that <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has, and as
                            far as Brazil is concerned, he said he intends to make a detailed study
                            now that he has Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZWJ_1">Zellerbach</persName>’s
                            report in hand. He said he plans to increase the overall information
                            program, particularly binational centers and the placement of films for
                            television in Latin America. There is no need at present for increasing

                        <p><pb n="329" facs="0370" xml:id="pg_329"/><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER_1">Black</persName></hi> asked what connection
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has with Franklin
                            Publications. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Ryan</persName></hi> explained that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> had a contract with this firm in the Middle East and
                            also has worked closely with it in getting books for India. In Latin
                            America, Franklin Publications operated without any funding from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. Franklin Publications is an
                            independent non-profit corporation which has underwritten the
                            publication of low cost American books in many of the developing areas.
                            The corporation has received money from <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to provide
                            incentives for local translations and circulation of low priced books on
                            a subsidized basis.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWR_1">Hewlett</persName></hi> noted that as the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program moves more toward self-help, it involves
                            putting pressure on the recipient government to make certain changes.
                            This results sometimes in resentment against the United States; what is
                            the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> mechanism for countering
                            this? <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said there is no magic answer, but it
                            requires a detailed, painstaking effort on the part of individual
                            officers. He cited two examples to make this point. The Public Affairs
                            Officer (<gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>) in London received an
                            inquiry from the editor of the <hi rend="italic">East Anglican Daily
                                Times.</hi> In an editorial, the editor had said, “Red China has
                            frequently advocated the use of force to extend Communist ideology”.
                            This statement was challenged by a prominent local Communist, and the
                            editor wrote to the <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> requesting
                            assistance in responding to the letter. The <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> supplied him with material and a few weeks later
                            received a letter from the editor saying, “You can mark off one more
                            disillusioned Communist in Suffolk.”</p>
                        <p>The second example concerned a man who became a regular library user in
                            Africa and participated in seminars organized there. Eventually, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> received a letter from him saying
                            that before he first entered the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            library he was a member of the Communist party, but with a curiosity
                            about the other way of life. Over a period of time, after he had read
                            books taken from the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> library, he
                            had changed his mind. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>
                            said this was particularly important since this man was a member of his
                            country’s parliament. Thus, in answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWR_1">Hewlett</persName>’s question, this problem can
                            be met only on a person to person basis with editors, opinion makers,
                            and those who are vocal in articulating opposing viewpoints.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Professor <persName corresp="#p_MFS_1">Mason</persName></hi> said he would like to place Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWR_1">Hewlett</persName>’s question in a specific
                            context. As a result of pressures from the United States and the World
                            Bank, the Government of India has undertaken some important economic
                            policy changes in the previous 6 or 7 months. This has resulted in
                            tremendous political reaction in many quarters in India. He asked if
                            this problem was subject to systematic consideration by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in India. <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that it
                            definitely was, that the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            personnel meet regularly on a Country Team basis with <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and Embassy personnel to plan
                            strategy. This is the idea behind the concept <pb n="330" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_330"/>of the Country Team. This type of problem must be
                            handled on the basis of person to person relationships locally. In many
                            cases, the Ambassador has to be the agent for carrying out Country Team
                            strategy, advised and assisted by the local <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> representatives.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> asked if there were any sign that the
                            recipients of public information programs around the world are tiring of
                            the overload of information and just do not wish to receive any more, as
                            sometimes happens when an information system becomes too intense. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi>
                            said he had seen no sign of this, though in individual instances there
                            might be some. He said he recently felt the U.S. was doing too much on
                            Vietnam in certain areas of the world. In general, however, there is no
                            feeling that the U.S. is doing too much in the information field.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> asked what reader indices <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> receives which it feels it can rely
                            upon. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> takes surveys of those who listen to its programs and
                            read its publications, using professional polling organizations around
                            the world. In some areas of the world this is meaningless because the
                            responses cannot be equated with those received in highly developed
                            societies. This type of information is also transmitted through reports
                            from field officers who have day to day relationships with important
                            audiences. Finally, it is obtained by analyzing mail; the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> receives approximately 400,000 letters
                            a year. When somebody takes the trouble to write a letter, and to post
                            it, which in some countries is a major undertaking, it is an indication
                            that they are gaining some benefit or want some information.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName></hi> asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> to suppose that the U.S. information program were
                            starting from scratch today. Assuming that any governmental effort to
                            present truth is subject to scepticism, simply because it has the stamp
                            of government, would it be better to put all of the information programs
                            under private auspices subsidized by government funds? <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said
                            absolutely not because a government operation must be completely overt.
                            When <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> speaks, it is the Voice of
                            America. It must be a government operation because that is the most
                            impressive way to demonstrate what the government position is. When a
                            news agency reports that the United States believes such and such, it
                            doesn’t have the same effect; what is reported may or may not be true.
                            However, when the government itself puts out a publication or says
                            something, that is official and it has to be official.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZWJ_1">Zellerbach</persName></hi> asked if <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> could compete with the professionals to properly staff

                            some of its leading writers came to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> for jobs, and were delighted to find that their
                            colleagues there were men of equal, if not higher, professional
                            standing. These men do not come simply from Madison Avenue, but come
                            from all over the United States. For example, some of the films <pb n="331" facs="0372" xml:id="pg_331"/>produced by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are examples of professionalism at

                            Europe. Radio Free Europe is privately supported, and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> knows what it does. Its efforts are
                            directed to parts of the world in which <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> operates, but in a different way; it tells the people
                            of Eastern Europe what is going on in their countries that they cannot
                            learn from their own news sources. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> tells them, instead, what is going on in the United
                            States and in the rest of the world as it affects U.S. objectives. Thus,
                            they complement one another, but do not have any direct association.</p>

                            which the Communists wage; indigenous Communist organizations in a
                            country will always seize upon <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to
                            help defeat a project they do not like. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BCB_1">Bowles</persName> had received the assurances of

                            Foundation would be welcome, and the Government of India has been
                            satisfied with the activities of the Ford Foundation in India. However,
                            because of the political climate and because of the opposition of the
                            Communists, a decision on the Binational Foundation could not be taken.
                                <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> said that he did not wish to imply that
                            his information was very accurate by suggesting that the Communist
                            opposition had torpedoed one proposal or another; however, <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi>
                            agreed that it helped to stimulate general opposition.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_PJA_1">Perkins</persName></hi> said he was impressed by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>’ statement that U.S. propaganda,
                            or rather the best propaganda, is to speak the truth. However, the
                            problem of deciding which truth to select for dissemination must be
                            relevant at some point and he asked if some specific cases could be
                            cited to show how the directions to be taken in certain countries had
                            been decided within the U.S. Government. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said that the head of
                            the operations of the United States Government in any country is the
                            Ambassador. He is head of the Country Team; everybody works for and
                            receives his general direction from the Ambassador. The Country Team
                            develops a Country Plan on what the United States’ objectives are in
                            that country; this plan is not a rigid blueprint, but rather is flexible
                            enough to change as U.S. interests require. The Ambassador, with the
                            assistance of the Country Team, determines what U.S. objectives are in
                            consultation with the Department of State and other agencies as
                            required. However, policy for that country is carried out by the
                            Ambassador on a day to day basis. The Ambassador is responsible for
                            deciding what is important to the United States, which he does after
                            consultation with his economic, political, military and information
                            advisors. In Brazil, for example, there was a recent inquiry as to the
                            ownership by non-Brazilian interests, of media such as <hi rend="italic">Time, Life</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Readers’ Digest</hi>.
                            Therefore, explaining to the Brazilian people that the participation of
                            American business interests is vital and important and beneficial to
                            them becomes an objective of the Country Plan. Once the objectives are
                            determined, the Ambassador decides how to go about attaining them. This
                            requires determination as to who the audience is and what might be the
                            best vehicle for reaching that audience—<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> said that he wishes to
                            do more to create a climate where business can operate, where people of
                            the individual countries realize that foreign investment has made a
                            beneficial contribution to the development of their country, and that
                            much can be achieved through coop<pb n="333" facs="0374" xml:id="pg_333"/>eration in telling this story. It is not only a government effort, but
                            wherever possible <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> tries to see
                            that it is a private enterprise effort, working in tandem with the
                            government. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Rockefeller</persName></hi> said that these efforts have been
                            most helpful in Latin America and have worked very well. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi>
                            said there are many things the government cannot do as well as private
                            business, and vice versa, so it is determined who can do a certain thing
                            best and that is how the program evolves.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName></hi> asked whether a problem was created by
                            people trying to decide when they were being told the facts and when
                            they were being influenced. <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName></hi> said this is not a
                            major problem since all of life is a matter of marshalling facts to sell
                            a product. Not all of the truth can be told, however, because in the
                            whole complex of facts there is too much. Therefore, it is necessary to
                            select the facts which are germane to the subject. In the process, many
                            facts which are unfavorable will be told, because confidence cannot be
                            gained if the material is not credible. He said that in his own practice
                            of law, he would readily admit to the court any fact which is adverse to
                            his client and then argue against it; that is what <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does to the world. It tells the
                            peoples of Latin America what the United States is doing, admits that
                            there is a large financial investment by American business there, and
                            then goes on to point out, however, that this is to the advantage of the
                            people. He said that the selection of the facts presented in order to
                            make sure that the impression is the one desired does not depreciate the
                            full impact of being an agency which tells the whole truth.</p>
                        <p>Another example, also in Brazil, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> continued, might involve <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> assistance for the development of natural resources.
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> would take the facts showing
                            how this would result in greater prosperity and a higher standard of
                            living. This also would be directed toward an objective of the Country
                            Plan, viz., to point out that the assistance being rendered by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> is in the national interest of Brazil.
                            That then would become a major project of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> information program in Brazil which would be
                            implemented through all of its media resources. These resources are
                            selected individually, having in mind the audience which it is desired
                            to persuade.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ZWJ_1">Zellerbach</persName></hi> mentioned that in northeast Brazil there

                            to decide who <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> wishes to reach
                            through its programs. In many countries, particularly in Africa, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> may wish to reach only 5% of the
                            population because public opinion in those countries means very little.
                            The leaders themselves determine policy and so it is necessary to reach
                            the leaders. He said that, nevertheless, a vast literacy program in

                            cartoon books in Portuguese designed for the neo-literates. This is a
                            great problem in all areas where literacy training programs are
                            underway. It is easy to train people to read, but then there is not
                            always reading material available for them. The cartoon book ties in the
                            visual image in rather simple language so that they can keep up their
                            reading skills. This is a general program throughout Latin America for
                            the neo-literates.</p>

                            following facts:</p>
                        <quote><p><pb n="335" facs="0376" xml:id="pg_335"/>(a) the air strikes
                                against North Viet-Nam are most often cited as a major unfavorable
                                element in terms of opinion on U.S. policy in Viet-Nam;<note n="6" xml:id="d107fn6">An unknown hand drew a vertical line in the

                            <p>(b) the fear that the conflict will escalate into a major war

                            <p>(c) nevertheless, opinion in many countries is preoccupied chiefly
                                with local problems and the conflict in Viet-Nam is of relatively

                            <p>(d) the military emphasis of reporting out of Viet-Nam, the use of
                                body counts, discussion of POW treatment, and the widespread use of
                                pictures of suffering and destruction are important factors working

                                against us, and there is a considerable David-and-Goliath sympathy

                        <p>We’re all doing the job now one way or another, but none of us is
                            satisfied that we’re doing the best job that could be done; several of
                            us are concerned that we’re not giving you the backstopping you
                            deserve.</p>
                        <p>The problem: the minimal staffs we have in our Area offices in
                            Washington. We don’t have enough people, and some of those we have
                            aren’t the right level. We are all aware of this, and as foreign affairs
                            become more involved, the situation becomes more critical. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s standards should be high; we want
                            to represent you properly. Too often it’s impossible to do so when one
                            Desk Officer, for instance, has to cover too many countries. We need
                            help!</p>
                        <p>You have had <persName corresp="#p_FHI_1">Herb Fredman</persName> and
                            others take close looks at many elements of the Agency, but you have
                            still to examine the Areas. Over the past several weeks the Area
                            Directors have colluded to take a look at their own offices to see what
                            their most urgent personnel needs are. Attached is a list of what we
                            honestly think we need. Ben Posner listened to our deliberations, as did
                                Mose.<note n="3" xml:id="d108fn3">Presumably a reference to

                        <p>We are aware of the locked-up budget, the personnel ceilings, etc., and
                            the many reasons anybody could cite 4not to increase our staffs. <pb n="339" facs="0380" xml:id="pg_339"/>Nevertheless, we think you
                            should be warned that we all feel we can’t do you justice unless we get
                            some help.</p>
                        <p>However, we think the best way to go at this would be to have a study
                            made of the Area offices to determine in fact the number of additional
                            positions required. Perhaps you could ask <persName corresp="#p_FHI_1">Herb Fredman</persName> to undertake such a study. This should
                            provide you with an objective picture of our problem.<note n="4" xml:id="d108fn4"><persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>At the meeting of the Advisory Commission which ended this morning, the
                            members requested me to express to you their continuing concern and deep
                            distress about the budget level of the Department of State’s educational
                            and cultural exchange programs.</p>
                        <p>The Commission is of course cognizant of the tremendous demands on the
                            Federal budget made by the war in Vietnam. Nevertheless, there are
                            hidden non-monetary costs in this war which we cannot ignore without
                            jeopardizing the understanding abroad of our national values. <pb n="341" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_341"/>The purpose of the educational
                            and cultural exchange programs is to keep open and reinforce the
                            channels through which this understanding must flow, and to safeguard
                            the historic friendships which this nation has built up over the years.
                            Members of the Commission who have recently traveled—in all parts of the
                            world—emphasize that it is precisely because of the war in Vietnam that
                            our efforts to create a balanced view of the totality of American
                            civilization and culture should be redoubled. Such understanding,
                            members of the Commission are persuaded, cannot be achieved by programs
                            directed solely towards “selling” specific aspects of foreign policy. It
                            must derive ultimately from a profound appreciation of the American
                            value system and our commitment to the goals which you so eloquently
                            expressed last September in your Smithsonian address.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">See <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> To
                            abandon or even reduce our traditional efforts in this field would cause
                            disappointment, indeed consternation, among the leadership elites around
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>It is a truism to point out that the mere maintenance of present program
                            levels represents an actual cut in program effectiveness. A fortiori, a
                            decrease in the program level would be a regrettable and costly form of
                            economy which we cannot afford, especially in this period of tension. We
                            fervently hope, therefore, that these views be considered when the
                            budget for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–68 is prepared for
                            presentation to the Congress, and trust you understand that our sense of
                            urgency stems from our obligations under <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 87–256.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">The Mutual

                        <p>I have just returned from a conference which I held of our Public Affairs
                            Officer representatives in Eastern European countries (Hungary, Rumania,
                            Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Soviet Union and Yugoslavia). From
                            this conference and meetings which I held in some of these capitals, I
                            would like to report the following:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. Viet Nam is not a matter of principal interest in the satellite
                                countries. It is a “convenient excuse” for taking certain actions or
                                refusing to do so, rather than a basic reason.</p>
                            <p>2. The Eastern European countries are primarily interested in
                                expanding trade with the U.S., in most-favored-nation treatment, in
                                increase of tourism, and improvement in the standards of living.</p>
                            <p>3. Even where <hi rend="italic">official</hi> relations are cool, our
                                representatives find cordiality in <hi rend="italic">personal</hi>
                                relations.</p>
                            <p>4. Except in Yugoslavia the press is biased, highly critical and
                                militantly adverse to official U.S. positions. However, in private
                                conversations there is a good understanding of U.S. objectives and a
                                latent sympathy.</p></quote>
                        <p>Following the conference, I accompanied Senator <persName corresp="#p_MWG_1">Warren Magnuson</persName> to Plovidiv, Bulgaria
                            for the “America Day” ceremonies at the Trade Fair. During the day we
                            called on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ZT_1">Zhivkov</persName>,
                            representatives of the Foreign Office and Trade Ministries. In our
                            meeting with the Prime Minister <hi rend="italic">at no time was there
                                any reference to Viet Nam</hi>, although the Prime Minister had
                            numerous opportunities to bring up the subject.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MWG_1">Magnuson</persName> explained his
                            sponsorship of the East-West Trade Bill and his hope that Congress might
                            consider it in its next session.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">For further
                                information about the East-West Trade Relations bill, see <ref target="frus1964-68v09#d181"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    181</ref> and <ref target="frus1964-68v09#d192">192</ref>.</note> He cautioned against optimism but registered his
                            strong support for the measure. In the discussion I pointed out that
                            Bulgaria was the only nation in Eastern Europe which still jammed the
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> (the jamming is only of
                            Bulgarian language and not English programs) and that if this practice
                            stopped it would be an indication of Bulgarian desire to cooperate. The
                            Prime Minister responded by saying, “I could stop the jamming in two
                            minutes—but then what would we Bulgarians <pb n="343" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_343"/>have to trade?” He also expressed irritation that
                            the Bulgarian representative in the U.S. was a Minister and not an
                            Ambassador. He felt that this was a discrimination which should be
                            eliminated. I got the feeling that if we upgraded our diplomatic
                            representation, he would order cessation of jamming. I intend to discuss
                            this with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> and
                            urge that this step be taken.</p>
                        <quote><p>5. In Yugoslavia new economic reforms have been introduced which
                                require all enterprise to “show profit” or go out of business. There
                                are striking similarities with our own free enterprise system and
                                the differences appear to be more in theory than fact. Yugoslavia
                                maintains its independence although it still clings to a theoretical
                                adherence to the communist bloc. The Yugoslavians believe that the
                                Czechs will follow this pattern and that there may be others in due
                                course who will also do so. I met with Ministry of Information
                                officials and found them highly cooperative. Our press relations
                                have improved materially and are likely to remain
                            favorable.</p></quote>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>From my observations I would conclude that although our formal relations
                            in Eastern Europe have not altered perceptively, there is a strong
                            undercurrent which is pulling these nations closer to the West; that
                            although there is no open support for our position in Viet Nam, there is
                            no active personal antagonism. In view of these conditions, continuing
                            close attention should be paid to our relations in Eastern Europe. At
                            some point it might be desirable to send a high level representative on
                            a good-will mission or as an emissary to discuss the possibility of Viet
                            Nam peace negotiations.</p>

                        <p>On October 21, 1966, Congress passed the International Education Act
                            (Public Law 89–698 (80 <gloss target="#t_Stat_1">Stat.</gloss> 1966)).

                            signed the bill into law on October 29, during his trip to Bangkok,

                            noted:</p>
                        <p>“One year ago at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., I
                            proposed that my country, the United States of America, launch a
                            concerted effort in international studies. I learned just a few days ago
                            while I was already here in Asia that our Congress had acted on this
                            proposal and passed a new law, the first step—the International
                            Education Act. That will have to be implemented, as it will be, as we go
                            along. Its purpose is to help Americans learn from other nations and, we
                            hope, to help other nations learn from America. It will also establish a
                            center for educational cooperation in Washington, D.C.</p>
                        <p>“I am so very proud that the American Congress has passed this act. I
                            think it is fitting and appropriate to sign this program into law here
                            today on this stage of this great university in a land where
                            international cooperation has now become a national byword.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, 1966</hi>, Book II, pages 1276–1278) For

                            14–15, 1966. Financed by the U.S.O.E. and sponsored by the interagency

                            it.</p>
                        <p>The member agencies of the Council are not alone in their concern with
                            this problem. Other U.S. Government agencies, and private agencies,
                            international organizations, foreign governments and individual scholars
                            are also involved. The Council therefore decided to sponsor a two-day
                            meeting. The first day was devoted to a workshop to review <pb n="346" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_346"/>past and current research on the “brain
                            drain,” at which critical problems and data requirements for future
                            studies could be reviewed. On the second day a conference was held to
                            provide a forum for a fuller exchange of information among people from
                            agencies and groups with programs or responsibilities connected with the
                            field of educational and cultural exchange.</p>
                        <p>These sessions produced no “miracle drug.” But they demonstrated the
                            complexity of the problem, and they provided useful insights and
                            specific directions for future steps. The principal issues, viewpoints,
                            and findings are summarized in the Introduction to the Report. Some of
                            the major conclusions, however tentative, that can be drawn from the
                            discussions are the following.</p>
                        <quote><p>1. There is a basic need for more facts to establish the actual
                                dimensions of the problem. Many of the necessary “raw” data are
                                available in our Immigration and Naturalization records. Much also
                                must be sought elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>2. The kinds of travelers to the United States who are involved in
                                this problem vary widely—in their status under our immigration laws,
                                their specialties, their relationship to developmental projects,
                                their obligation to return home and, of course, in their
                                professional, social and personal motivations.</p>
                            <p>3. The primacy <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> of the problem lies in
                                the developing countries. It is in connection with these countries
                                that strong incentives should be provided to induce foreign
                                nationals to return home—for example, attractive job opportunities
                                and facilities—and social and political <hi rend="italic">milieu</hi>.</p>
                            <p>4. The governments of developing countries vary greatly in their
                                concern with the problem and in their views and policies regarding
                                it. One step that they might take would be to encourage for study
                                and work abroad only those individuals who are morally or legally
                                committed to return home. Another would be to increase communication
                                with their nationals while abroad so as to keep them abreast of
                                developments at home, thus minimizing their alienation from their
                                own cultures.</p>
                            <p>5. Means should be found to enable developing countries to exchange
                                information as to what they are doing to attract their nationals
                                homeward.</p>
                            <p>6. Again with respect to developing countries, greater emphasis
                                should be placed on developing training and research facilities in
                                countries other than their own but in the same region, where
                                students, scholars, scientists, and other professional personnel can
                                do advanced work within an environment similar to their own.</p>
                            <p>7. In the United States, one of the principal “host” countries, more
                                might be done to provide: special academic programs to equip foreign
                                students more adequately for jobs in their home countries;
                                predeparture orientation to prepare them for reentry into their home
                                environment; and a full awareness by all sponsors of
                                development-related projects of their responsibility to encourage
                                the return of foreign visitors whose work in the U.S. they
                                sponsor.</p>
                            <p>8. The United States can cooperate with other governments,
                                intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations
                                and <pb n="347" facs="0388" xml:id="pg_347"/>institutions abroad in
                                such efforts to reduce the “drain” as home-recruitment projects and
                                institution-building. Moreover, insofar as it increases its own
                                pools of skilled manpower to meet its own needs, it will decrease
                                the opportunities for the employment of skilled persons from other
                                countries.</p></quote>
                        <p>Here in the United States, the Conference has been followed by certain
                            steps which are advancing our realistic consideration of the problem, in
                            both the Government and the private sectors.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service
                            are giving priority to the development of statistical procedures which
                            have the objective of providing the data needed for a meaningful
                            appraisal of the dimensions of the talent migration. Also, the
                            Department of State has alerted its missions abroad to the significance
                            of the problem and the need for encouraging other governments to assume
                            more responsibility for the return of their own. The American Council on
                            Education, which has shared the Government’s concern about the “brain
                            drain,” has played a leading role in focusing attention on the problem
                            in the university world. The American Council’s Commission on
                            International Education has deliberated at length on the “drain” at a
                            number of sessions and is preparing a soon-to-be-published statement
                            which attempts to define in reasonable terms the responsibility of the
                            American academic community toward the problem.<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">Not further identified.</note></p>

                            <p>In his Message to Congress of February 2, 1966,<note n="5" xml:id="d113fn5">See <ref target="#d113fn3">footnote 3</ref>
                                    above.</note> the President said, “Education lies at the heart
                                of every nation’s hopes and purposes. It must be at the heart of our
                                international relations.” Books, by definition, are essential to
                                education and to the achievement of literacy. They are also
                                essential to communication and understanding among the peoples of
                                the world. It is through books that people communicate in the most
                                lasting form their beliefs, aspirations, cultural achievements, and
                                scientific and technical knowledge.</p>
                            <p>In the United States and other developed countries, where there has
                                been the opportunity for a long time to emphasize education and
                                books, there have been created vast resources of printed materials
                                and other forms of recorded knowledge in all fields of human
                                endeavor. In the United States, a great complex of library systems
                                has emerged, serving ordinary citizens as well as students and
                                scholars. In the developing countries, where more than two-thirds of
                                the world’s population live, there is an acute need for the books
                                essential to educational growth and general social progress, and for
                                libraries which can enable these nations more easily to acquire and
                                use the technology of the modern world. The United States Government
                                declares that it is prepared, as a major policy, to give full and
                                vigorous support to a coordinated effort of public and private
                                organizations which will make more available to the developing
                                countries those book and library resources of the United States
                                which these countries need and desire.</p>
                            <p>The total needs of the developing countries with regard to books
                                cannot be adequately filled by assistance from the outside; nor,
                                under present conditions, can they be filled from local resources.
                                From a long-range point of view, the establishment of viable book
                                publishing and distributing facilities in the developing countries
                                and regions is essential. It shall therefore also be the policy of
                                the United States Government to encourage and support the
                                establishment of such facilities.</p>
                            <p><pb n="350" facs="0391" xml:id="pg_350"/>The utility of books goes
                                beyond their contribution to material progress. The free and full
                                exchange of ideas, experiences and information, through books, is
                                indispensable to effective communication between people and nations,
                                and has a unique role to play in the enrichment of the human spirit.
                                Recognizing this, the United States Government is further prepared,
                                as a major policy, actively to promote the free flow of books and
                                other forms of recorded knowledge.</p>
                            <p>The task of filling the world’s need for books and of achieving an
                                adequate exchange of books among the nations is immense. No single
                                institution or agency and no single government can hope to
                                accomplish it alone. It is therefore essential that all agencies of
                                Government concerned in any way with international book and library
                                programs assign to these a high priority. It is further essential
                                that they coordinate their book and library efforts with those of
                                other pertinent government agencies and private institutions. If new
                                legislation or special funds are needed to carry out this policy,
                                agencies will make appropriate requests to the Congress. All
                                agencies of Government, under the direction of the Department of
                                State, should actively seek to cooperate with other governments on a
                                bilateral or multilateral basis in the achievement of these
                                objectives.</p>
                            <p>The Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs
                                has the responsibility for coordinating United States Government
                                efforts in this field.</p>

                        <p>In a December 12 memorandum, Assistant Director, Latin America, <persName corresp="#p_BKK_1">Kermit Brown</persName>, stated that two of the

                            largest on the horizon for 1967” were:</p>
                        <quote><p>“a. Negotiations with Panama over the Canal and military
                                bases.</p>

                            <p>“d. Perennial political instability of Latin American

                        <p><gloss target="#t_IAL_1">IAL</gloss> further emphasized that the main
                            problem regarding personnel issues was “the gradual deterioration of
                            quality of our personnel caused mainly by the Viet Nam drain.”
                            (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Assistant Director, East Asia and Pacific, <persName corresp="#p_ODP_1">Daniel Oleksiw</persName>, noted in a December 7 memorandum that
                                <gloss target="#t_IAF_1">IAF</gloss> saw “no major shifts in the
                            East Asia and Pacific area which would change the current focus of U.S.
                            concern.” According to <persName corresp="#p_ODP_1">Oleksiw</persName>,
                            the “war in Viet-Nam is expected to continue through 1967 in no less an
                            intensive manner than at present” and the “major issue of concern will
                            continue to be combating communist insurgency in Viet-Nam, Thailand and
                            Laos and making the dangers of ‘wars of national liberation’ known to
                            other countries of the area, especially Japan.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Assistant Director, Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, <persName corresp="#p_DRT_1">R.T. Davies</persName> noted in his December 6
                            memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>: “For
                            obvious reasons, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> will
                            continue to be the principal focus of U.S. attention in 1967,” but
                                <gloss target="#t_IAS_1">IAS</gloss> “may also become involved in a
                            good deal of additional activity regarding Poland.” “Beyond that,” he
                            stated, “our principal concerns will revolve around maintaining our
                            activities in Eastern Europe at their present level and, if possible,
                            expanding them in Poland and by small increments elsewhere.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Finally, Assistant Director, Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Alan Carter</persName>, listed as his “probable” issues of greatest
                            concern: “food aid and population explosion,” “polarization of Arab
                            World,” “military assistance and arms aid <pb n="356" facs="0397" xml:id="pg_356"/>(particularly in the Middle East),” “Vietnam war,”
                            “disengagement from overly close association with U.S. policies
                            (particularly Turkey and Iran),” “mixed economy versus socialism in
                            terms of development,” and “industrialization versus agricultural
                            development.” (Ibid.)</p>

                            number of important issues. I have been intending to give you my own
                            thoughts on long-range reorganization matters independently of this. But
                            let me respond to each of his recommendations first.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">A transfer of the purely academic elements in the
                                exchange programs from State to the new Center for Educational
                                Cooperation, <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>.</hi></p>
                        <p>This is in principle a desirable move, which I have already explored
                            quietly with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> and Niller, and
                            which has received a sympathetic hearing from them. It requires,
                            however, careful coordination by State, since the overseas
                            administration of the exchange program, which is handled mainly by
                            binational commissions, requires careful diplomatic liaison. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in State should remain in charge of this
                            overseas representational job, since there can be only one Secretary of
                            State. In principle, appropriations could go to the new Center, and that
                            part of the appropriation to be spent by binational commissions abroad
                            could be reallocated to State acting as the overseas agent. Such a
                            procedure is workable, and would be superior to the present arrangement
                                <pb n="357" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_357"/>educationally, financially
                            and politically. I have already laid the groundwork for such an eventual
                            move by beginning a reorganization in my own Bureau, but must naturally
                            move slowly until such an arrangement is financially approved.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">A shift of the overseas administration of the
                                “non-academic” programs for foreign leaders and for cultural
                                presentations to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</hi></p>
                        <p>This, to my mind, would be undesirable. The exchange of foreign leaders,
                            even when it has political purposes as it often does and should, should
                            not be overtly a public relations operation. Its context and atmosphere
                            should be long-range, and should be geared to the broad goals of better
                            mutual understanding rather than to the immediate informational
                            objectives. Cultural Affairs Officers are better able to manage such
                            operations than Information Officers, and, in any case, decisions about
                            foreign leaders are normally made by the entire “country team” in an
                            embassy under the leadership of the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>With regard to cultural presentations, the present situation is not a
                            good one, but <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, in view of the
                            various Congressional pressures upon it, and also in view of its own
                            outlook and primary mission is not the agency to handle cultural
                            presentations. The ideal arrangement, to my mind, would be to create a
                            council which brings together State, the National Council on the
                                Arts,<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">The National Arts and Cultural

                            present, handled by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Cultural
                            Affairs Officers. In the future, the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> could handle these as part of a coordinated educational
                            and cultural program overseas. Precisely because Information Officers
                            have, as the writer says, “an overtly political function”, they should
                            not be in charge overseas of cultural presentations.</p>
                        <p>The above reorganization would help greatly to insulate cultural
                            presentations from the pressures which now prevent this program from
                            being as important as it should be. It would, in the American style,
                            approximate the advantages gained by the British Council.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">The British Council was founded in 1934 as an
                                executive non-department public body that receives United Kingdom
                                Government grants, but does not operate on behalf of the government.
                                According to its founding charter, its mission is “promoting abroad
                                a wider appreciation of British culture and civilization.”</note>
                            Once again, I have explored these matters with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RSD_1">Ripley</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SGC_1">Stevens</persName> and Keaney, and I now have in my shop a Special
                            Assistant already working on the coordination of the resources in the

                            operations.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Elimination of <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>
                                slots from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, conversion of

                        <p>The writer is absolutely correct in his view that the present situation
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> within <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and under a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, is extremely bad. Based on my own
                            interviews and talks with CAOs, I believe he speaks for the overwhelming
                            majority of <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAOs</gloss> in the field. The
                                <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> should be an independent

                        <p>I do not agree, however, that the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>
                            should be an “<gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss> employee.” If he is
                            to be effective, he must be a full member of the Embassy team, and this
                            means he should be a Department of State officer. However, I do think it
                            desirable that the pattern we have established with regard to Education
                            Officers be followed with <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAOs</gloss>—namely,
                            that recruitment be a joint State-<gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>
                            venture, that criteria for selection be jointly established, and that
                            the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> have an opportunity to work in
                                <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss> (particularly in the Center for
                            Educational Cooperation) on appropriate occasions when he is on duty in
                            the United States. It may also be desirable that funds for the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> be provided from <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss> budgets, but this is something that I
                            do not think <gloss target="#t_BOB_1">BOB</gloss> is likely to accept,
                            and does not seem to me fundamental.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Maintenance of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                                technical assistance and vocational programs under <gloss target="#t_USOM_1">USOM</gloss> chiefs.</hi></p>
                        <p>From a purely administrative point of view, this is probably necessary
                            and desirable. However, it is not the case that “<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> technical assistance and vocational
                            programs” can be insulated from other educational activities, or that
                            they do not in themselves involve fundamental problems of cultural
                            relations and cultural understanding. The difficulties now encountered
                            by these programs are due in large part to the narrow conception that
                            underlies them and to the comparatively narrow and limited outlook and
                            background of the Americans overseas responsible for them. For this
                            reason, an officer is needed in embassies who can coordinate these
                            programs with other educational and exchange activities within the
                            embassy, who can reach the powerful people at the top of the educational
                            pyramid in the host country, and who can develop guidelines that all the
                            agencies with an educational mission can follow. This is the primary and
                            indispensable function of our proposed Education Officer.</p>
                        <p>Similarly in Washington an instrument of coordination is needed to
                            develop such broad guidelines for our foreign activities. With
                            back-stopping from the new Center for Educational Cooperation, this
                            should be the primary function of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> in
                            State. We have already begun to operate in this manner, but much more
                            needs to be done. The proposed reorganization within <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> would carry us farther down the road. So
                                <pb n="359" facs="0400" xml:id="pg_359"/>would the proposed
                            Executive Order<note n="6" xml:id="d116fn6">Not found.</note> which has
                            been prepared, and which has been approved not only by State but by all
                            other agencies (<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, Peace Corps, <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>, etc.) that are now members of the
                            federal Interagency Council on International Educational and Cultural
                            Affairs. However, at the moment, <gloss target="#t_BOB_1">BOB</gloss>
                            seems disinclined to issue this order despite the universal support for
                            it.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Retention of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural

                        <p>I believe my answers to the above questions indicate my view of the role
                            of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>. It includes what the writer says,
                            but also the very important functions of diplomatic representation
                            overseas, management of the exchange programs, and coordination.</p>
                        <p>This, I believe, covers most of the items raised in the letter. I would
                            add only that I do not view the projected Education Officer position as
                            replaceable across the board by a <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>,
                            even if the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>, as is desirable,
                            becomes a full State Department officer reporting through the
                            Ambassador. Assuming that international education is to be a primary
                            thrust in our foreign policy, and assuming that administrative
                            responsibilities for it will be shared among various agencies, someone
                            is needed on the spot to orchestrate the operation. The <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss> will have special and important duties
                            of his own, and could not also perform this coordinating function where
                            our educational operations are large and varied. However, if there were
                            a change in the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>’s status, we would
                            probably need Education Officers only in our largest missions—at a guess
                            30. In the smaller missions the <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>
                            could well perform both functions.</p>
                        <p>The views I have described above, and particularly those related to the
                                <gloss target="#t_CAO_1">CAO</gloss>, have been discussed with the
                            Secretary of State, who supports them. There is also considerable
                            support, indeed pressure, from people like Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE_1">Bruce</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_AGV_1">George Allen</persName>, and others. This, as you know, is a
                            sensitive bureaucratic matter, but I think the time has come to take
                            some action with regard to it. I shall discuss this with you.</p>

                        <p>I wish I could put a red star on this memo or clip to it a little tag
                            saying “this is the heart of the matter”, or even if necessary employ
                            State Department jargon and say “this is the gut issue”.</p>
                        <p>There is a decreasing interest in the best <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> motion pictures and it results from a shift in Agency
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The popular word today is “targeted”, meaning that a communication is
                            designed to implement a precise “country objective” and that in the
                            judgment of some country expert it does so. I don’t believe that this is
                            a sound approach for a propaganda agency which serves a hundred and some
                            odd countries. You cannot attract the manpower to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> which can implement such a highly
                            diverse and specialized communications program. By distributing the
                            responsibility for content and style to lower echelons, as is necessary
                            if each country or desk is to shape its own product, you ultimately rely
                            on lesser quality individuals, not well trained or particularly
                            talented, to make the decisions and shape the style and content of media
                            products.</p>
                        <p>I will give you one example because it is small and simple. I could give
                            you 50.</p>
                        <p>The attached report<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">Not found
                                attached.</note> from Bangkok is typical of a growing trend. It is
                            the response to three films distributed by the Agency, two of which were
                            produced by <gloss target="#t_IMV_1">IMV</gloss> at the request of and
                            in consultation with all area and policy offices.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Transportation <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss></hi> and <hi rend="italic">Celebration</hi> are
                            dismissed by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Bangkok as “not
                            suitable for the village audiences” in Thailand. No prints were ordered.
                            They consider the village audiences important yet they do not intend to
                            show them two principal Agency products.</p>
                        <p>This is not as you might argue, a matter of taste. It is a matter of
                            policy and Agency direction. The attitude in Bangkok, and at an
                            increasing number of other posts, is that the only materials to be
                            distributed are ones which they view as having “direct program value”,
                            “applying to country objectives”, “carrying the freight”, or whatever
                            slogan is presently in vogue. It is not that the slogans are so bad,
                            rather that the interpretation is rapidly narrowing.</p>
                        <p><pb n="363" facs="0404" xml:id="pg_363"/><gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Bangkok can express it another way, and would if asked
                            say that the Agency has no business making “Transportation <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss>” or “Celebration” (or any other number
                            of our best works). I happen to think they are wrong. However, if they
                            are right, and the Agency must make a policy decision on this, we have
                            no business running a top-flight documentary motion picture and
                            television operation.</p>
                        <p>I can show you in elaborate detail that the two films in question are
                            serving us throughout the world with great effectiveness, wherever they
                            are given the opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Someone must say, beyond funding and approving these and like projects,
                            “part of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s business is to
                            communicate the American spirit. It is part of our job to let people
                            around the world know that the United States is an extraordinary and
                            wonderful country inhabited by some damn fine people.”</p>
                        <p>Your regional advisors do not see this as important work; or in the
                            current gobbledygook of the trade, they argue that they have a country
                            plan and post objectives which must come first.</p>
                        <p>I believe that this philosophy has never been more wrong than it is today
                            at a time when the motives and morals of this country, its President and
                            its people are being castigated in every corner of the earth. Our
                            associates would disagree. Yet, whether their targeted propaganda
                            blatantly presented persuades anyone is seldom measured, or more
                            urgently whether it offends anyone is hardly considered.</p>
                        <p>Coincident with the field message rejecting two powerful films about the
                            American people for Thailand audiences (who, it appears, are going to
                            have to adjust to living alongside Americans in uniform) I received the
                            Saturday Review.<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">Popular American

                            beauty is sometimes throat-catching. This is the film’s major comment .

                            people being killed for the reasons of policy.”<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">Reference is to the 1966 documentary film,

                                glimpse of such places as Hanoi, Haiphong, and Cam Pha, with all the
                                public manifestations of what is obviously a Marxist society.” See
                                Hollis Alpert, “Know the Enemy,” <hi rend="italic">Saturday

                        <p>I know the writer. He is not a declaimer of our policy in Vietnam. Yet he
                            was propagandized, not by political argumentation, rather by scenes
                            dealing with people in human terms. Your advisors reject as unproductive
                            our efforts in that direction. Consider the irony that <pb n="364" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_364"/>communist states, long ridiculed for
                            their dreary heavy handed approach to propaganda, have become more
                            sophisticated and clever than <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> by
                            using techniques which I am being urged to abandon.</p>
                        <p>And how hypocritical are we, basking in <hi rend="italic">Time
                                Magazine’s</hi> praise words—“swinging”, “new sound”, “vigorous,
                            amusing, avant-garde—the first with the latest”—while the policy shifts.
                            The new Worldwide English was done, in truth, behind the backs of the
                            area people. If they could intercept <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> like they do films, they would not use it. They would
                            say “get rid of Sinatra,<note n="5" xml:id="d118fn5">American singer and
                                actor, Frank Sinatra.</note> Fatha Hines,<note n="6" xml:id="d118fn6">American jazz musician Earl “Fatha” Hines.</note>

                            the freight . . . hit the ‘post objectives’.”</p>
                        <p>With the aforementioned communication from Bangkok came another demanding
                            that the successful Thai Report television series be adjusted to contain
                            100% freight rather than 50% freight. . . . “we seek to minimize the
                            merely amusing or frivolous—as folk songs, dances, sports or tourism”.
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Thailand is saying to us,
                            we’ll get it on television and slug the yellow jerks with freight . . .
                            fill their bamboo living rooms with U.S. country objectives.</p>
                        <p>And you say to me that we must rely on the area people (presumably
                            without regard to their quality of mind) on all such matters.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully suggest that you cannot say that we must rely completely
                            on the people in the field. Policy, philosophy and direction are
                            determined in Washington and there has been a drift in direction. The
                            Agency is losing sight of the forest for the trees. The people in the
                            field must be <hi rend="italic">led</hi>, not followed.</p>
                        <p>If a change cannot take place my advice to you must be that the
                            filmmaking money is going largely to waste because our distribution is
                            badly managed; that the pendulum is ready to swing back to the films of
                            Turner Shelton<note n="8" xml:id="d118fn8">The Director of Motion

                            in a fundamental redirection of its activities. In that month, in his

                            with other countries would be a central and deliberately emphasized
                            feature of U.S. foreign policy, and expressed an enduring national
                            interest of the United States.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">For <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s remarks, see <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> This was followed by the

                        <p>To carry this new initiative in foreign policy forward, fundamental
                            changes are required both in <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and in
                            the Government as a whole. More than 25 agencies of the Federal
                            Government now carry on programs involving educational and cultural
                            activities abroad. Most do so simply as a by-product of their normal
                            activities—e.g. the <gloss target="#t_NSF_1">NSF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AEC_1">AEC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, which has the
                            largest budget for international education, is committed in principle to
                            phasing out its assistance efforts, and is project-oriented mainly along
                            technical and economic lines. In short, although the participation of
                            Federal agencies in international education is both extensive and
                            varied, the programs that have been inherited need to be coordinated and
                            redesigned if educational and cultural policies are to be coherent, and
                            are to be front and center in our foreign relations.</p>
                        <p>In all this, a special responsibility falls on <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>. First, as a Bureau of the Department of State it has
                            the responsibility for policy-guidance and leadership to facilitate
                            coordination—a responsibility already fixed on it by Executive
                                Order.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                            Second, although its own programs are smaller than those of many other
                            agencies, they are the most visible <pb n="366" facs="0407" xml:id="pg_366"/>and symbolic, and are the prototypes of the
                            cooperative binational and multinational programs envisaged by the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has been regrouping its
                            forces during the past year in order to achieve certain central
                            objectives:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The movement of educational and cultural relations
                                to the front and center of U.S. foreign policy</hi>. This has been
                            carried forward by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s participation in
                            the preparation of the Smithsonian Address, the President’s Message of
                            February 2, and other statements, by its leadership of the President’s
                            special Task Force on International Education, by its active association
                            with the planning and organization of the new Center for Educational
                            Cooperation in <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>, and by its role in
                            the preparation and passage of the International Education Act, the

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The improvement and sharpening of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s coordinative function.</hi> The
                            existing mechanism for coordinating programs is the “Federal Interagency
                            Council on International Educational and Cultural Affairs,” which is
                            chaired by the Assistant Secretary. During the past year, old
                            subcommittees have been reactivated and new sub-committees formed—e.g.
                            for international book programs and English-language teaching
                            abroad—which have greatly improved coordination. Other informal groups
                            in the sciences and the arts have also been created which are proving
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>However, this coordinative function is at present performed largely by
                            means of persuasion, and remains limited and patchy. An Executive Order
                            has accordingly been prepared, more or less parallel to the Sig-Irg

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s programs break down into three
                            main types:</p>
                        <quote><p>a. Academic programs;</p>

                        <p>The academic programs are governed in a large number of cases by
                            binational commissions established under the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> law, and though chaired by an Embassy officer, are
                            independent, on the whole, of the day-to-day political operations and
                            plans of the regional bureaus or the country teams. The leaders and
                            specialists program and cultural presentations programs are more
                            responsive to the expressed desires of the regional bureaus and country
                            teams. On the whole, however, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> has in
                            the past functioned as a quasi-independent agency performing <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> services for the regional bureaus. This is
                            an unsatisfactory state of affairs. It is proposed that <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> officers work as educational advisers
                            within the regional bureaus in order to ensure that the plans of these
                            bureaus will systematically incorporate plans for cooperative
                            educational and cultural relations with other countries.</p>

                        <p>In Washington, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> are independent. <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s function under the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> law<note n="9" xml:id="d119fn9">See, <ref target="#d14fn4">footnote 4, Document 14</ref>.</note> is to
                            promote mutual education and cultural exchange, largely through exchange
                            of persons. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s function is to
                            promote sympathetic understanding of the United States, <pb n="368" facs="0409" xml:id="pg_368"/>largely through use of the so-called
                            “fast media,” although <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> also has a
                            number of “long-range” programs—e.g. libraries, translations, etc. For
                            practical purposes, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> deals in
                            “persons”; <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> deals in “things.”</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that the functions of the two agencies are distinct,
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s programs overseas are conducted
                            by Cultural Affairs Officers who are members of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>, and who work under the immediate
                            direction of a Public Affairs Officer. In short, the Assistant Secretary
                            does not have overseas people directly responsible to him or the
                            Ambassador for carrying out State Department policies. This
                            administrative anomaly dates back to 1953 when what is now <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> was removed from the Department of
                            State while the cultural program, as a result of a Congressional
                            resolution, was separated from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            and retained in the Department. At that time, however, the overseas
                            administration of the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName>
                            educational and cultural exchange program was left in the hands of

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Significance of the International Education
                            Act</p>
                        <p>As part of the effort to involve American colleges and universities more
                            fully and directly in international education, the International
                            Education Act was prepared and has now been passed. Over the years,
                            assuming Congressional appropriations, this Act means that American
                            universities are likely to engage in a large number of exchange programs
                            they design and operate themselves, with the financial support of the
                            Federal Government. Under these circumstances, the State Department
                            programs will serve to fill out and supplement a federally supported
                            effort, and should be closely coordinated with programs under the
                            International Education Act.</p>
                        <p>In order to move in this direction, a new Center for Educational
                            Cooperation has been created in the Department of Health, Education, and
                            Welfare. In addition to operating its own program of grants, this Center
                            will conduct regular reviews and analyses of the American nation’s total
                            resources and efforts in international education, something much needed
                            for purposes of planning and coordination. The function of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> under these circumstances is to lead and
                            coordinate the overseas side of this effort since foreign operations
                            must remain under the control of the Secretary of State. As these new
                            programs develop, it may be expected that some of <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s present operational responsibilities
                            will gradually shift to <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>. However,
                            although preparations have already begun for such a step, it should
                            obviously not be taken until we know better the character and quality of
                            the new Center.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The East-West Center</p>
                        <p>The East-West Center in Hawaii is established under separate legislation
                            and had the special interest of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, Congressmen <pb n="369" facs="0410" xml:id="pg_369"/><persName corresp="#p_RJJ_1">Rooney</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BFT_1">Bow</persName>, and Governor Burns of
                            Hawaii. The Center is a federally supported institution, but the grant
                            is made to the State of Hawaii, and, through the State, to the
                            University of Hawaii. Legally the situation is fuzzy. Congress insists
                            that the East-West Center is a federal institution; the Board of Regents
                            at the University of Hawaii tend to regard the East-West Center as a
                            responsibility of the University. It has been proposed that the
                            East-West Center be established clearly as a federal corporation, and
                            that the responsibility for it be shifted from State to <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>. This idea makes sense over the long
                            run, but is clearly premature at the present moment and should be
                            checked out with Congress and the White House.</p>

                            Soviet Union is so intermingled with large-scale political
                            considerations affecting our relations with Eastern Europe that
                            responsibility for negotiating these agreements and controlling their
                            political aspects has been placed in the Europe Bureau. However, because
                            there is a substantive educational and cultural aspect of this program,
                            actual responsibility for recruiting people, preparing presentations,
                            etc., has rested with <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, and the
                            supporting budget for this operation is part of the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> appropriation. On the whole, this
                            arrangement has worked satisfactorily, due largely to the fact that
                            Assistant Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_LJM_1">Leddy</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> have consulted
                            closely and that their staffs have a close and sympathetic relationship.
                            Since the exchanges agreement with the Soviets include much that does
                            not come under <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>’s operational
                            authority—e.g., agricultural exchanges, industrial exhibits, etc.—the
                            problem of transferring total authority over exchanges to <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> is complex. This is a matter that should
                            be reviewed when the new structures created to carry the President’s

                                of U.S. Universities: The “Technological Gap”</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I was invited by Mr. Christensen, Dean of the Educational and Cultural
                            Officers in D.C., to attend their meeting with the Board of Directors of
                            the National Association for Foreign Student Affairs (NAFSA) and
                            representatives of about 50 U.S. universities enrolling more than 400
                            foreign students. A few of the embassy representatives were concerned
                            with consular rather than with educational or cultural affairs.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was devoted almost entirely to the question of the
                            “technological gap” between the United States and other countries with
                            emphasis on the flow of their students to and from the United States. (A
                            significant addition is noted below.) Thus it served as something of an
                            indicator of current thinking of other governments or, at least, of
                            their embassies in Washington regarding this problem.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of the foreign embassies represented, Mr. Christensen expressed
                            his thanks to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> of
                            the American Council on Education and to me, as the representative of
                                <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, for our attendance. (We were the
                            only “outsiders” invited.) He referred with appreciation to the previous
                            discussion of this problem at a cultural officers’ meeting in the
                            Department of State and to the Report of our June Conference,<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref> and <ref target="#d112fn2">footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> which all
                            embassies in Washington have now received. He also said that, since the
                            meeting and the circulation of the Report, he and his colleagues had
                            given much thought to this problem. He referred also to the interest of
                            the American Council as indicated particularly in the recent number of
                            the Council’s <hi rend="italic">Bulletin on International

                            He hoped that there would be future meetings on the same theme, and
                            perhaps even definite suggestions to make within the next few months,
                            when, as he assumes, Congress will consider something like the
                                “<persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> Bill” of the last
                                Congress.<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4">See <ref target="#d112fn4">footnote 4, Document 112</ref>.</note> He looks forward to
                            pursuing this question further at the monthly meetings of cultural
                            officers. At some such meeting representatives of the Immigration and
                            Naturalization Service will be invited to participate.</p>
                        <p>The Report of the June conference, the summary by <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>/PRS, dated November 1, 1966,<note n="5" xml:id="d120fn5">See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> and the ACE’s
                                <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, implicitly served as the working
                            papers for the discussion. This was reflected in the meeting and in
                            informal conversations with key people afterwards. While no resolutions
                            or recommendations were made, the general trend of the discussion may be
                            summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Much of the discussion was based upon the assumption that, as someone
                            put it, it is “impossible to generalize about foreign students as
                            such—there are too many kinds.” To try to cover all of them in any
                            single form, legislative, political or academic, would do more harm than
                            good since it would lead to more and more inflexibility rather than the
                            other way around. Much of the discussion was based on an acceptance as
                            fundamental, of the distinction between the “unsponsored” foreign
                            students, usually here under “F” visas, and the “sponsored” students,
                            that is, those under “J” visas, and <hi rend="italic">and also</hi>
                            those sponsored by other countries—their governments, institutions, or
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>2. It was well recognized that unsponsored students form by and large the
                            greater number. Most other countries are as reluctant to stop the exit
                            of their citizens as the U.S. is to stop their entry. Such action would
                            put a limitation on their freedom of movement, which not only would be
                            morally unjustifiable, but also, in many cases, would deprive them of
                            the superior opportunities for study which are offered in the United
                            States. This feeling is tempered, however, by a general concern about
                            the need for trained personnel in their own countries. There seemed to
                            be a general consensus that more might well be done by the sending
                            countries to persuade their students to return home after their
                            studies—largely by building up their own institutions, making more and
                            better job opportunities available, and providing facilities, <pb n="372" facs="0413" xml:id="pg_372"/>salaries and standing, which
                            would give promise of adequate job satisfaction. There was no indication
                            that specific steps should be taken by the U.S. Government through
                            legislation to control the flow of these unsponsored students to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>3. These steps, and others also, apply to “sponsored” students—those
                            under J visas <hi rend="italic">or</hi> sponsored by their own
                            countries. (The ratio of students under the sponsorship of the other
                            countries to other foreign students was suggested by some of the figures
                            that were mentioned. Thus, of 1200 Iranian students reportedly in the
                            United States, only 200 are sponsored by the Iranian Government. Out of
                            some 8000 Indians, only 100 are under the direct sponsorship of the
                            Indian Embassy.) It was recognized that there was a gap between these
                            two types of “sponsored” visitors, but no suggestions were made that
                            further action by the U.S. Government would solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>It seemed generally agreed that the purpose of the “two-year rule”<note n="6" xml:id="d120fn6">Reference is to the United States
                                Government’s “2-year home-country physical presence requirement” for
                                recipients of J Visas, which required that these visa recipients
                                return to their home countries for a cumulative period of at least 2
                                years at the conclusion of their exchange programs in the United
                                States before being allowed to: change status to nonimmigrant H or L
                                worker visas; adjust status to that immigrant visa holder or lawful
                                permanent resident; or receive an immigrant visa or H or L worker
                                visas at U.S. embassies or consulates.</note> for “J” students was a
                            well-meant attempt by the U.S. Government to discourage the permanent
                            residence here of a large percentage of such “sponsored” students, but
                            it was pointed out that the U.S. has no control over where foreign
                            visitors may go after they leave the U.S. under this rule. That many of
                            them go to “third countries” rather than home simply underlines first,
                            the unwillingness of many of them, for one reason or another, to return
                            home immediately, at least, and secondly, the essentially multilateral
                            nature of this problem. The “drain” is not only to the United States.
                            (It was reported that, at a meeting of representatives of five South
                            American countries last August, Mr. Galo Plaza, former President of
                            Ecuador, discussed the “brain drain” with particular reference to a
                            recent study in Chile. It was proposed at that meeting that this item be
                            put on the prospective “summit meeting” next year in Latin America.<note n="7" xml:id="d120fn7">Presumably a reference to the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> summit that took place in Punta
                                del Este, Uruguay, April 11–15, 1967. See <ref target="#d117fn3">footnote 3, Document 117</ref>.</note>)</p>
                        <p>Attention continued to focus on what other countries might do to plug the
                            leaks in the flow of sponsored students. It was pointed out that there
                            were many points in the “lifeline” of the foreign student at which some
                            action can be taken by their own countries. Where students are selected
                            by the other governments or institutions such selection should be made
                            in full awareness of the need for such trained people <pb n="373" facs="0414" xml:id="pg_373"/>in their own countries. A few countries
                            already have more specific controls. India, it was reported, has some
                            control through (1) foreign exchange regulations, (2) the quality of
                            students selected as determined by their academic records, and (3) the
                            priority of fields of current significance to Indian development. This
                            also meant closer collaboration between other countries and American
                            universities, whose autonomy and independence of the federal government
                            places a correspondingly greater duty on the representatives of other
                            governments to work cooperatively and persuasively with them and with
                            their students to maintain student interest in returning home. The
                            degree of cooperation between the representatives of other countries and
                            American universities varies widely in practice from country to country.
                            Representatives of governments which were already doing much of this
                            attested warmly to the cooperation which they had received from
                            universities, notably from foreign student advisers. Such cooperation
                            might not only be increased, but extended by strengthening connections
                            between “hosts” and “home” <hi rend="italic">institutions</hi>, where
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Another useful step that should be more widely used is that of job
                            placement afterwards. One example of placement efforts here in the U.S.
                            was offered by the Korean representative, who explained that Korea had
                            an office in New York specifically for this purpose. Placement offices
                            might well be established in the home countries also, and continuous
                            contact maintained between these placement offices and foreign students
                            even before their return. Such offices, if they were to be successful,
                            would have to offer students a reasonable choice of opportunities which
                            they would wish to pursue at home. “International institutes” outside
                            the U.S. might also help solve the problem, as the Latin American group,
                            already referred to.</p>
                        <p>It was also suggested that part of the solution of the problem lies in
                            the field of public relations in the home countries, and that our
                            Conference Report with its summary might be used as a basis for such
                            publicity. (I made no objection to this point. We have already sent
                            copies to each of the embassies in Washington as well as to our own
                            posts abroad. What use they make of the Report is something which each
                            government should decide for itself.)</p>
                        <p>In regard to possible legislation and government controls there seemed to
                            be a general feeling that what was needed essentially was greater
                            flexibility in the conditions governing study and stay in the U.S.,
                            including more time to be spent here, but combined with or compensated
                            for, by making such periods more specific and clear cut and by taking
                            decisive action at the end of that time. The U.S., for example, should
                            allow two years rather than eighteen months for “practical field work”
                            for foreign students thereby enriching the experience that they can
                            bring to bear on their return to their own countries. <pb n="374" facs="0415" xml:id="pg_374"/>Prompt decisiveness in action regarding
                            their return would go far to minimize leakage. Decisiveness in
                            administering regulations might also, somewhat, discourage the
                            “drifting” of “eternal students” from one university to another while in
                            this country.</p>
                        <p>There was no enthusiasm for precise, tight arrangements between the U.S.
                            Government and the other governments involved in the enforcement of
                            international travel regulations or the selection of students, beyond
                            those which grow out of already existing, broader agreements—for
                            example, those involving the binational commissions and the USOMs in the
                            respective countries.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of American universities were very active in the
                            discussion. They emphasized particularly, that the basic position of the
                            U.S. should be not to “exploit” the flow of students from other
                            countries insofar as such flow is designed to build up institutions and
                            generally provide trained manpower. At the same time they confirmed the
                            opinion expressed by several embassy representatives that cooperative
                            contact could be a very effective way of keeping in current touch with
                            their students during their stay, bringing to the special attention of
                            university officials the special significance of students whose studies
                            here were designed to fill manpower needs in their own countries.
                            Initiative for such contacts rested with the embassies. They pointed out
                            that U.S. institutions, like governments, were reluctant to discourage
                            entry into their institutions.</p>
                        <p>In private conversations after the meeting, some of them deplored the use
                            by the U.S. of the term “brain drain” as being, however well meant, a
                            phrase easily exploitable for anti-American propaganda. They preferred
                            the use of such terms as the migration of talent and skills,” or the
                            “technological gap.”</p>
                        <p>In general the meeting was a useful one. The representatives of NAFSA
                            indicated that they should like to pursue this problem in their regional
                            meetings during the next several months.</p>
                        <p>The discussion also brought out the following facts. First, that the
                            statistical gap in the diagnosis of this problem is as great in other
                            countries as it is in the U.S.; the fields that were stressed in general
                            conversation were the health professions (physicians and nurses
                            especially) and engineering, with emphasis on electronics. The
                            discussion by and large followed the suggestion made in the <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>/PRS summary of November 1, 1966, in that
                            it was primarily a lively exchange of information and views which helped
                            put the problem in sharper perspective while, at the same time,
                            underscoring a wide variety of concerns and problems faced by other
                            countries in carrying these matters out. The embassy representatives
                            that were most active in expressing themselves were those of the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, Chile, Ecuador, Greece, Iran, India,
                            Israel, and Korea.</p>
                        <p><pb n="375" facs="0416" xml:id="pg_375"/>I restricted my remarks to
                            indicating that we were still pursuing our diagnosis of the problem and
                            would welcome any suggestions for dealing with it. I brought them up to
                            date on the summary of current action attached to the Conference Report,
                            offering to talk informally with embassy representatives or university
                            officials on this matter individually.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Addendum</hi></p>
                        <p>Much of the first hour of the meeting was devoted to a discussion of a
                            problem which the chairman, Mr. Christensen, in effect, ruled out of
                            order, but in which consular representatives in particular, expressed
                            great interest. Chance reference to the proposal of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDH_1">Henry</persName>, of Harvard, on the desirability
                            of a new kind of an “H” visa, led to some discussion of it. Stressing
                            the fact that he was speaking for himself as an individual, not as a
                            representative of Harvard University, much less NAFSA, he indicated that
                            the so-called “H” visa and the “J” visa under which visiting instructors
                            or professors came to the U.S., was unsatisfactory; the former because
                            it was interpreted as requiring proof that the position to be filled by
                            a visiting instructor was a “permanent” one whereas universities would
                            prefer to describe such positions as “temporary.” Otherwise, he thought,
                            we were in effect perpetuating the “brain drain” by insisting on the
                            “permanence” of “temporary” teachers. As to the J visa he indicated that
                            the two-year rule frequently broke up a man’s work when he might be
                            making an important contribution. He would like to propose the
                            establishment of a new H visa under which prospective instructors could
                            be allowed to occupy a post declared to be “temporary” so that, in
                            effect, if they turned out well, they could continue to stay here
                            unhampered by the two-year rule. While several questions were asked of
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDH_1">Henry</persName> regarding his
                            proposal, no one else spoke in support of it. One representative
                            (India), said that it was precisely this sort of thing that he thought
                            would actually increase the “brain drain,” especially because of the
                            difficulty of determing the meaning of the word “temporary” in this
                            context. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDH_1">Henry</persName> replied by
                            citing certain examples especially in the field of area studies.</p>

                        <p>Critical views of American society and culture held by many foreigners
                            are frequently based on one or more of the following notions:</p>
                        <p>— That the United States is a “cultural wasteland”;</p>
                        <p>— That the U.S. educational system, despite rich material facilities, is
                            qualitatively inferior to that of several other countries;</p>
                        <p>— That the “democratic ideals” Americans talk about are mostly
                            window-dressing, and that in reality U.S. society is shot through with
                            gross racial injustices, economic inequities, and social
                            disorganization;</p>
                        <p>— That America’s “capitalist” economic system results in riches and power
                            for the few and exploitation and oppression for the many;</p>
                        <p>— That despite some technical accomplishments, the U.S. is not really in
                            the forefront in scientific achievement.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Such views of American society and culture undermine
                                confidence in the United States. They inevitably come to form part
                                of the frame of reference within which U.S. actions and words are
                                perceived and evaluated and thus they influence judgments about what
                                the U.S. does and says in its relations with other countries. They
                                color the way foreign people see U.S. intentions. For these reasons
                                they have great relevance for the mission of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in all countries.</hi></p>

                            want to stress in treating the following areas that are most important
                            for U.S. foreign policy considerations:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Education:</hi> Our treatment should underline the
                            fact that the economic, scientific, and cultural accomplishments of the
                            U.S. are solidly based on an educational system of high quality which is
                            free to <pb n="377" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_377"/>all through the twelfth
                            grade and accessible to a large proportion of its citizens even at the
                            university level; not rigidly controlled by political or social
                            conventions; and continually experimenting with new forms, techniques,
                            and organizational methods to improve existing systems and to solve new
                            problems created by the expansion of man’s knowledge.</p>
                        <p>In discussing what remains to be done in this area we should point out
                            that the Great Society<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">See <ref target="#d83fn3">footnote 3, Document 83</ref>.</note> concept

                            special significance to overseas audiences are the proposals in
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s Smithsonian
                            address (9/16/65) that the U.S. engage in programs for the sharing of
                            its educational knowledge with the citizens of other countries in a
                            two-way exchange that will both enrich U.S. culture and assist the
                            modernization process in other countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d121fn3">See <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note> Several of these
                            proposals are embodied in the International Education Act of 1966.<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">An unknown hand bracketed this

                            comparisons and undue emphasis on material wealth, our treatment should
                            show that the U.S. has fashioned the most productive economy the world
                            has ever seen, based on the dynamic inter-action of labor, business, and
                            government. We should describe our mixed economy in such a way that
                            audiences are not automatically alienated by their negative reactions to
                            terms (such as “capitalism”) whose meanings have changed considerably
                            over the years. Thus, we should show that our economic prosperity and
                            strength are attributable to the balance worked out between freedom of
                            private initiative on the one hand, and public regulation on the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>Where appropriate we should detail such ingredients of our system as
                            strong labor unions, social benefits, a progressive tax system, and
                            government regulation of matters affecting the public interest. We
                            should not obscure the fact, however, that our consumer-oriented economy
                            and the discipline of the marketplace have led us to allocate our
                            material and human resources productively. We should point out that when
                            government regulation or control enters in, it does so in response to
                            crisis or need rather than for ideological reasons, and that this
                            introduction of pragmatism (as opposed to ideology) into government
                            planning and assistance is perhaps the greatest contribution of the U.S.
                            to economic theory.</p>

                            racial injustice—goals aspired to by most nations and which they can

                            audiences attach to our profession of ideals. The United States has one
                            of the most diverse populations in the world. In the acculturation
                            process in the United States many minority groups have suffered
                            discrimination, as they have and still do in many other countries. What
                            is most significant in this process in the U.S., however, is not the
                            clash of interests inevitably generated by the stresses and strains of
                            social change, but rather the overriding fact that our social,
                            political, and economic systems provide means by which minorities can be
                            (and are) integrated into the mainstream of American life. And we should
                            stress the corollary fact that in the present struggle for full
                            participation by the Negro in American life, the full moral and legal
                            weight of the federal government is on the side of peaceful social
                            change.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Scientific and Technical Achievement:</hi> The
                            people of the world’s advanced countries respect scientific and
                            technical achievement because they know the key role science and
                            technology have played in improving man’s condition. Leaders of the
                            developing nations are equally aware that modernization of their
                            countries depends largely on the successful application of scientific
                            and technical knowledge to their particular problems. It is
                            understandable, therefore, that among our foreign audiences respect for
                            such achievement can have special significance in determining attitudes
                            toward, and judgments of, the United States.</p>
                        <p>Our treatment should show that the U.S. is one of the leaders of the
                            international scientific community, with a depth and breadth of pure and
                            applied scientific research unmatched in any other country. In
                            describing U.S. space achievements and our other advances in the <pb n="379" facs="0420" xml:id="pg_379"/>area of science we should
                            stress the openness of these efforts and the willingness of our
                            scientific community to share information and to provide specific know
                            how and assistance to other countries throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Cultural Development:</hi> While the scientific and
                            technological achievements noted above command worldwide attention and
                            respect, important portions of our foreign audience place even greater
                            emphasis on cultural and intellectual achievements as the measure of a
                            society’s worth. Many, in fact, tend to equate cultural maturity with
                            political maturity.</p>
                        <p>Our main point should be that the United States, drawing on the wealth of
                            intellectual, artistic, philosophic and religious traditions brought by
                            immigrants, has developed a dynamic culture marked by great <hi rend="italic">diversity and freedom</hi>. The diversity is reflected
                            in the wide range which characterizes writing and the arts in America
                            today. The freedom is evident in our culture’s creative vitality and in
                            the willingness of American artists (and their audiences) to experiment
                            with new forms and new ideas. It has enabled us to make original
                            contributions to many forms of the creative arts. We should further
                            point out that the generally high standard of living in the United
                            States, by providing a large proportion of the population with the
                            necessary means, leisure, and educational background, has strikingly
                            broadened the base of participation in all aspects of cultural activity.
                            At the same time, the development of mass communications techniques has
                            increased the ability of most Americans to share in the enjoyment of the
                            culture of other lands as well as of our own. Our treatment should also
                            make clear that the United States, as a matter of policy, seeks to share
                            the best of its cultural products with the peoples of other nations, and
                            invites reciprocation, through both private and governmental programs of
                            cultural exchange. The U.S. believes strongly in the freedom to create,
                            not only for its citizens but for peoples everywhere, and it vigorously
                            promotes the free flow of culture among nations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>In explaining these dimensions, our task is to show that American society
                            has the intelligence, character, and moral fiber to solve its own
                            problems and has the capacity for world leadership; that it is coherent,
                            dynamic, and fully committed to progress and change; that it is guided
                            by humanitarian concerns; and that it has an exciting and varied
                            culture. In portraying a society with these characteristics we should
                            not imply that it is without imperfections or problems, nor should we
                            imply that we believe our particular pattern of institutions and values
                            is the “right” one for other people. To the extent that we exercise a
                            leadership role we do so with genuine respect for the values of others
                            and in full <pb n="380" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_380"/>recognition of the

                        <p>If the United States has surplus agricultural capacity to supply food for
                            freedom—so too does it have a surplus capacity in another crop that
                            helps build not only better bodies but better minds as well: books.</p>
                        <p>I suggest a four-part program.</p>
                        <p>1) <hi rend="italic">Library Schools.</hi> To be built in underdeveloped
                            countries, at the invitation of governments, to be staffed and supplied
                            with U.S. personnel if needed and desired—with the express intent of
                            training native librarians. The theoretical arithmetic is interesting:
                            if a library school turns out 30 librarians a year and each librarian
                            ultimately serves a constituency of 750 persons after graduation, and
                            the United States helps set up 30 library schools throughout the world,
                            then in a decade 7 million people have been exposed to a library, or,
                            figured another way, 35 million people have been exposed to a library
                            for one year. Key to program: schools must be there, not here.</p>
                        <p>2) <hi rend="italic">Libraries.</hi> We will help supply dollars to build
                            and stock new libraries in local communities. Possibly an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>—Peace Corps project.</p>
                        <p>3) <hi rend="italic">Librarians.</hi> We will provide through Peace
                            Corps, until local library schools can provide enough local talent.</p>

                            amount, upon request from the Government. This would include

                            when men read Karl Marx and Thomas Jefferson, we come out of it pretty
                            well.</p>
                        <p>Also: we will provide—on a much expanded basis from what <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is now doing—kits of paperback books
                            sent directly to schools and libraries for distribution to students. One
                            hundred million paperback books can be purchased for about 10 million
                            dollars <hi rend="italic">at publishers’ cost</hi>. If four people read

                            per person. If the book happens to be “Life on the Mississippi”,<note n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">The autobiographical book, published in 1883,

                            and the economics of publishing also give a bonus to producing “at cost”

                                LIBRARY ACTIVITIES</p>
                            <p>In his message to Congress of February 2, 1966, the President said,
                                “Education lies at the heart of every nation’s hopes and purposes.
                                It must be at the heart of our international relations.” Books, by
                                definition, are essential to education and to the achievement of
                                literacy. They are also essential to communication and understanding
                                among the peoples of the world. It is through books that people
                                communicate in the most lasting form their beliefs, aspirations,
                                cultural achievements, and scientific and technical knowledge.</p>
                            <p>In the United States and other developed countries, where there has
                                been the opportunity for a long time to emphasize education and
                                books, there have been created vast resources of printed materials
                                and other forms of recorded knowledge in all fields of human
                                endeavor. <pb n="383" facs="0424" xml:id="pg_383"/>In the United
                                States, a great complex of library systems has emerged, serving
                                ordinary citizens as well as students and scholars. In the
                                developing countries, where more than two-thirds of the world’s
                                population live, there is an acute need for the books essential to
                                educational growth and general social progress, and for libraries
                                which can enable these nations more easily to acquire and use the
                                technology of the modern world. The United States Government
                                declares that it is prepared, as a major policy, to give full and
                                vigorous support to a coordinated effort of public and private
                                organizations which will make more available to the developing
                                countries these book and library resources of the United States
                                which these countries need and desire.</p>
                            <p>The total needs of the developing countries with regard to books
                                cannot be adequately filled by assistance from the outside; nor,
                                under present conditions, can they be filled from local resources.
                                From a long-range point of view, the establishment of viable book
                                publishing and distributing facilities in the developing countries
                                and regions is essential. It shall therefore also be the policy of
                                the United States Government to encourage and support the
                                establishment of such facilities.</p>
                            <p>The utility of books goes beyond their contribution to material
                                progress. The free and full exchange of ideas, experiences and
                                information, through books, is indispensable to effective
                                communication between people and nations, and has a unique role to
                                play in the enrichment of the human spirit. Recognizing this, the
                                United States Government is further prepared, as a major policy,
                                actively to promote the free flow of books and other forms of
                                recorded knowledge.</p>
                            <p>The task of filling the world’s need for books and of achieving an
                                adequate exchange of books among the nations is immense. No single
                                institution or agency and no single government can hope to
                                accomplish it alone. It is therefore essential that all agencies of
                                Government concerned in any way with international book and library
                                programs assign to these a high priority. It is further essential
                                that they coordinate their book and library efforts with those of
                                other pertinent government agencies and private institutions.
                                “Agencies will propose to the President for transmittal to the
                                Congress any requirements for new legislation or special funds to
                                carry out this policy.” All agencies of Government, under the
                                direction of the Department of State, should actively seek to
                                cooperate with other governments on a bilateral or multilateral
                                basis in the achievement of these objectives.</p>
                            <p>The Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs
                                has the responsibility for coordinating United States Government
                                efforts in this field.</p>

                        <p>January 4, 1967</p>
                        <p>Dear Student Leaders:</p>
                        <p>I have received and read carefully your thoughtful letter to the
                            President about our policy in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Your interest and your concern are shared by most thinking Americans. No
                            one desires more strongly to bring an early and honorable conclusion to
                            the conflict in Viet-Nam than those who are working day and night, both
                            here and in Viet-Nam, to achieve that end.</p>
                        <p>The questions you have raised are among those that have been asked and
                            discussed repeatedly in the councils of your Government. If some of
                            these matters continue, as you say, to agitate the academic community,
                            it is certainly not because answers have not been provided. It is more,
                            I think, because the answers to great and complex questions can never
                            fully satisfy all the people in a free and questioning society.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I am glad to have the chance to address myself to the four
                            specific questions about which you stated you and others felt doubt or
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>First, you asked if America’s vital interests are sufficiently threatened
                            in Viet-Nam to necessitate the growing commitment there.</p>
                        <p>There is no shadow of doubt in my mind that our vital interests are
                            deeply involved in Viet-Nam and in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p><pb n="388" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_388"/>We are involved because the
                            nation’s word has been given that we would be involved. On February 1,
                            1955, by a vote of 82 to 1 the United States Senate passed the Southeast
                            Asia Collective Defense Treaty. That Treaty stated that aggression by
                            means of armed attack in the treaty area would endanger our own peace
                            and safety and, in that event, “we would act to meet the common
                                danger.”<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">For further information
                                regarding the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, see <ref target="frus1952-54v12p1#d358"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    the Pacific, Document 358</ref>; and <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2#d1168"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    Document 1168</ref>.</note> There is no question that an
                            expanding armed attack by North Viet-Nam on South Viet-Nam has been
                            under way in recent years; and six nations, with vital interests in the
                            peace and security of the region, have joined South Viet-Nam in defense
                            against that armed attack.</p>
                        <p>Behind the words and the commitment of the Treaty lies the lesson learned
                            in the tragic half century since the First World War. After that war our
                            country withdrew from effective world responsibility. When aggressors
                            challenged the peace in Manchuria, Ethiopia, and then Central Europe
                            during the 1930’s, the world community did not act to prevent their
                            success. The result was a Second World War—which could have been
                            prevented.</p>
                        <p>That is why the Charter of the United Nations begins with these words:
                            “We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding
                            generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has
                            brought untold sorrow to mankind. . . .” And the Charter goes on to
                            state these objectives: “to establish conditions under which justice and
                            respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of
                            international law can be maintained . . . and to unite our strength to
                            maintain international peace and security. . . .”</p>
                        <p>This was also the experience President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> had in mind when—at a period when the United
                            Nations was incapable of protecting Greece and Turkey from aggression—he
                            said: “We shall not realize our objectives unless we are willing to help
                            free peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national
                            integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them
                            totalitarian regimes.”<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4">Reference is to
                                President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>’s March 12,
                                1947, “Special Message to the Congress on Greece and Turkey: The
                                    <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> Doctrine.” For
                                text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName></hi>, <hi rend="italic">1947</hi>, pp. 176–180.</note></p>
                        <p>These are the memories which have inspired the four postwar American
                            President as they dealt with aggressive pressures and thrusts from
                            Berlin to Korea, from the Caribbean to Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>In short, we are involved in Viet-Nam because we know from painful
                            experience that the minimum condition for order on our planet is that
                            aggression must not be permitted to succeed. For when it does <pb n="389" facs="0430" xml:id="pg_389"/>succeed, the consequence is not
                            peace, it is the further expansion of aggression.</p>
                        <p>And those who have borne responsibility in our country since 1945 have
                            not for one moment forgotten that a third world war would be a nuclear
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The result of this conviction and this policy has been a generation’s
                            effort which has not been easy for the United States. We have borne
                            heavy burdens. We have had to face some conflict and a series of
                            dangerous situations.</p>
                        <p>But the hard and important fact is that in the postwar world external
                            aggression has not been permitted to develop its momentum into general
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Look back and imagine the kind of world we now would have if we had
                            adopted a different course. What kind of Europe would now exist if there
                            had been no commitment to Greece and Turkey? No <persName corresp="#p_MGC_1">Marshall</persName> Plan? No <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>? No defense of Berlin? Would Europe
                            and the world be better off or worse? Would the possibilities of detente
                            be on the present horizon?</p>
                        <p>Then turn the globe and look at Asia. If we had made no commitments and
                            offered no assistance, what kind of Asia would there now be? Would there
                            be a confident and vital South Korea? A prosperous and peaceful Japan?
                            Would there be the new spirit of regional cooperation and forward
                            movement now developing throughout Asia?</p>
                        <p>If you were to talk to the leaders of Asia as I have, you would know what
                            Asians really think of our commitment in Viet-Nam. You would know that
                            the new vigor in Asia, the new hope and determination, are based in part
                            on the conviction that the United States will continue to support the
                            South Vietnamese in their struggle to build a life of their own within
                            the framework of the Geneva Accords in 1954 and 1962<note n="5" xml:id="d124fn5">See <ref target="#d71fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    71</ref>.</note>—that we shall see it through to an honorable
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Second, you wonder whether our vital interests are best protected by our
                            growing commitment.</p>
                        <p>We must always weigh what we are doing against the requirements of the
                            situation and what the other side is doing. You are aware, I am sure,
                            that the flow of men and material from North Viet-Nam into the South
                            radically increased towards the end of 1964 and continued at a high
                            level in the next two years. It was to meet that escalation, designed to
                            achieve military victory by the North against the South, that we sent
                            our men in large numbers and began an air campaign against military
                            targets in North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p><pb n="390" facs="0431" xml:id="pg_390"/>At the other end of the scale,
                            one must contrast what we are doing with what we could be doing. You
                            know the power that is available to us—in men, resources and
                            weaponry.</p>
                        <p>We have done both more than some people would wish, and less than others
                            advocate. We have been guided both by the demands imposed upon us by
                            increased aggression and by the need for restraint in the application of
                            force. We have been doing what the President judges to be necessary to
                            protect the nation’s vital interests, after hearing the views of the
                            government’s military and civilian experts. We shall continue to do what
                            is necessary to meet the threat the Vietnamese and their allies
                            face.</p>
                        <p>Third, you raise the question whether a war that may devastate much of
                            the countryside can lead to the stable and prosperous Viet-Nam we hope
                            for.</p>
                        <p>First, it is an error to suggest that the fighting in Viet-Nam has
                            devastated much of the countryside.” There has been too much destruction
                            and disruption—as there is in any war. And we deeply regret the loss of
                            life that is involved—in the South and in the North, among both soldiers
                            and civilians.</p>
                        <p>But devastation has been far less than on the conventional battlefields
                            of World War II and Korea. If peace could come to South Viet-Nam today,
                            I think most people would be amazed at its rapid recovery. For the
                            Vietnamese are intelligent, energetic and ambitious people. And they are
                            determined to see their country prosper. I am confident that they can
                            achieve that end—if they but have the chance to do so, in peace and in
                            their own way.</p>
                        <p>That day cannot come too soon.</p>
                        <p>You also suggest that there are “apparent contradictions” in the American
                            position on efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>We have said that there will be no difficulty in having the views of the
                            Viet Cong presented at any serious negotiation. The details of how this
                            might be done can be discussed with the other side; there is little
                            point in negotiating such details with those who cannot stop the
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>We have made it clear that we cannot accept the Liberation Front<note n="6" xml:id="d124fn6">The National Liberation Front, also known as
                                the Viet Cong.</note> as the “sole” or “only legitimate voice” of
                            the Vietnamese people. Yet that is what the Front has said it is. The

                            Government and people of South Viet-Nam to conduct the election of the
                            Constitutional Assembly in September 1966, despite the opposition of the
                            Viet Cong, made clear that the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> are a
                            small minority in the country, determined to convert their ability to
                            organize for terror into domination over the majority. Those now
                            enrolled with the Viet Cong should be turning their minds in a different
                            direction. They should be asking: “How can we end this war and join as
                            free citizens in the making of a modern nation in South Viet-Nam”?</p>
                        <p>We know that the effort at armed conquest which we oppose in Viet-Nam is
                            organized, led, and supplied by the leaders in Hanoi. We know that the
                            struggle will not end until those leaders decide that they want it to
                            end.</p>
                        <p>So we stand ready—now and at any time in the future—to sit down with
                            representatives of Hanoi, either in public or in secret, to work out
                            arrangements for a just solution.</p>
                        <p>You state correctly that we have a commitment to the right of
                            self-determination of the people of South Viet-Nam. There is no
                            ambiguity whatsoever. We shall abide by the decision of the Vietnamese
                            people as they make their wishes known in free and democratic elections.
                            Hanoi and the Liberation Front do not agree.</p>
                        <p>You also suggest that there is disparity between our statements and our
                            actions in Viet-Nam, and you refer to recent reports of the results of
                            our bombing in North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>It is our policy to strike targets of a military nature, especially those
                            closely related to North Viet-Nam’s efforts to conquer the South. We
                            have never deliberately attacked any target that could legitimately be
                            called civilian. We have not bombed cities or directed our efforts
                            against the population of North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that there has been loss of life. We recognize that people
                            living or working in close proximity to military targets may have
                            suffered. We recognize, too, that men and machines are not infallible
                            and that some mistakes have occurred.</p>
                        <p>But there is a vast difference between such unintentional events and a
                            deliberate policy of attacking civilian centers. I would remind you that
                            tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, wounded, or kidnapped
                            in South Viet-Nam, not by accident but as the result of <pb n="392" facs="0433" xml:id="pg_392"/>a deliberate policy of terrorism and
                            intimidation conducted by the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>We regret all the loss of life and property that this conflict entails.
                            We regret that a single person, North or South, civilian or soldier,
                            American or Vietnamese, must die.</p>
                        <p>And the sooner this conflict can be settled, the happier we and the
                            Vietnamese people will be.</p>
                        <p>Meantime, we shall continue to do what is necessary—to protect the vital
                            interests of the United States, to stand by our allies in Asia, and to
                            work with all our energy for a peaceful, secure and prosperous Southeast
                            Asia. Only by meeting these commitments can we keep on this small and
                            vulnerable planet the minimum conditions for peace and order.</p>
                        <p>Only history will be able to judge the wisdom and the full meaning [of]
                            our present course—in all its dimensions.</p>
                        <p>But I would close by sharing with you a hope and a belief. I believe that
                            we are coming towards the end of an era when men can believe it is
                            profitable and, even, possible to change the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi> by applying external force. I believe those in Hanoi who
                            persist in their aggressive adventure—and those who support
                            them—represent ideas and methods from the past, not the future.
                            Elsewhere in the world those committed to such concepts have faded or
                            are fading from the scene.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that if we and our allies have the courage, will,
                            and durability to see this struggle through to an honorable peace, based
                            on the reinstallation of the Geneva Accords of 1954 and 1962, we have a
                            fair chance of entering quieter times in which all of us will be able to
                            turn more of our energies to the great unfinished tasks of human welfare
                            and to developing the arts of conciliation and peaceful change.</p>
                        <p>The overriding question for all of mankind in this last third of the
                            Twentieth Century is how to organize a durable peace. Much of the
                            experience which has gone into answers to that question has been largely
                            forgotten—perhaps some of it should be. But the question remains—and
                            remains to be answered. I should much enjoy discussing this with you if
                            we can find a way to do so.</p>
                        <p>I would value a chance to discuss the issues posed in your letter with a
                            representative group of signatories or with as many as could
                            conveniently join me in Washington at a mutually agreeable time.</p>

                        <p rend="center">(October 1–December 31, 1966)</p>
                        <p>Over the years, Communist media have kept up a steady stream of attacks
                            on <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and its various programs. Much
                            of the material is trite and untimely, but serves as a reminder that the
                            ideological struggle is unceasing.</p>
                        <p>Of all the Communist states, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            has shown the greatest sensitivity to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs and activities, not only those directed at
                            the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but also in the underdeveloped
                            countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Soviet attacks on the
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> vary greatly in frequency and
                            in virulence. On occasion, Soviet propagandists have praised the
                            “professionalism” of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> efforts and
                            urged Communists to emulate its more successful techniques.</p>
                        <p rend="center">ATTACKS ON <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss></p>
                        <p>The Voice of America is the most frequent target of Soviet efforts to
                            counter Western propaganda activities. Soviet government efforts to
                            limit the impact of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> on its Soviet
                            audience is strong, if indirect, evidence of the radio’s effectiveness
                            in this area. A number of times over the past year, Moscow’s own radio
                            carried direct rebuttals of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            broadcasts and attacked <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>
                            broadcasters and officials. However, most of Moscow’s attacks on the
                            Voice are oblique. Soviet propagandists wish to avoid giving dignity to
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>, or to calling attention to the
                            voice of the enemy. Moreover, Soviet officials apparently have
                            recognized the danger of building up <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’s potential audience by heightening the feeling among
                            Soviet citizens that it is “forbidden fruit.”</p>
                        <p>Moscow’s favorite charge against <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is
                            that it “distorts” the news, and especially the policies and efforts of
                            the Soviet government. In the recent Leningrad trial of two Americans
                            accused of currency speculation and theft, Moscow Radio accused <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> of “distorting the essence of the
                            charge” and of a ten-fold error in quoting the amount <pb n="394" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_394"/>of the fine asked by the
                                Prosecutor.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2">Reference is to the arrest

                            one-half months of disarmament talks in Geneva, Radio Moscow accused
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> not only of “tendentiousness”
                            but of “deliberately concealing the truth” from its listeners, and of
                            trying to becloud the U.S. position:</p>
                        <quote><p>According to the Voice of America, it seems that the disarmament
                                talks are taking place not on the earth but on some other planet not
                                accessible to the echoes of events in Vietnam. . . . It is not
                                accidental that the Voice of America tries to distort the true state
                                of affairs on these issues, attempting to prove that the Soviet
                                Union is allegedly to blame for the absence of agreement on them.
                                Moreover, the U.S. radio commentators are not in the least
                                embarrassed by the fact that their statements flagrantly contradict
                                the facts.</p></quote>
                        <p>In a similar vein, <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and other Western
                            radios were attacked in the literary magazine <hi rend="italic">Moskva</hi> for allegedly unsympathetic and “wild stories” on the

                        <p>Soviet attacks on the Agency generally have centered on the following: 1)
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is an integral part of the
                            U.S. intelligence community and thus an “arm of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>;” 2) <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>—and <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> in particular—is the official
                            propaganda instrument of the U.S. Government and thus is not objective;
                            and 3) <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s major function worldwide
                            is to slander Communism and sell Capitalism.</p>
                        <p>A favorite recent tack has been to focus attention on the size of the
                            anti-Communist ideological conspiracy. The authoritative Soviet Party
                            journal <hi rend="italic">Kommunist</hi> in September described the
                            broad basis of the “propaganda combines” furthering the dissemination of
                            anti-communist ideas as follows:</p>
                        <quote><p>Leading among them is the information agency of the <gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>), which maintains propaganda centers in 105
                                countries. In foreign countries alone, the Agency publishes 68
                                journals and 20 newspapers in 25 languages. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has at its disposal hundreds of

                        <p>b. The International Education Act provides for long-term back-up support

                            implement government policy, but they are not part of the planning and

                        <p>3. Another set of difficulties have been caused by worries about <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> influence, classified research,

                            but, as the representative of State, I have convened meetings with

                            systematically and dispassionately, and see whether, through their
                            organizations, they have any definite advice to give the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>4. Special difficulties have been caused by reductions in the budget for

                        <p>Whatever Congress may do, I think the President would be well advised to
                            promise his strong personal support for these programs. This would do
                            much to demonstrate the importance he attaches to <pb n="400" facs="0441" xml:id="pg_400"/>educational and intellectual matters.
                            It would also help a bit to alleviate anxieties about Viet Nam if these
                            programs, which comparatively cost so little, were also strongly
                            supported.</p>

                            an unprecedented effort to build a nation in the midst of a shooting

                        <p>We should focus attention upon the determination with which Vietnamese,

                            and difficult job.</p>
                        <p>We must give candid recognition to the fact that it may be some time
                            before these exertions begin to show substantial results. Doing so will
                            provide opportunity to take frequent account of a fundamental reason why
                            the task is so large and difficult—the systematic Viet Cong attempt to

                                More than a simple expansion of previous rural pacification
                                programs, this program is an effort to weave together a single
                                program to cope with all aspects of the struggle for hamlets and
                                villages. The chosen instrument is the specially-trained 59-man
                                armed team which enters a village to establish local military
                                security, learn the grievances and aspirations of the villagers. In
                                the process team members offer technical advice, funds and
                                materials—and their own labor—to the villagers to carry forward

                                success is the “Open Arms” program to attract defections from enemy
                                ranks. Some 11,000 enemy soldiers, political teams, etc. came over
                                in 1965, and 20,242 in 1966, an increase of 82%. The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> hopes to bring in over 45,000 in
                                1967, although this figure is for planning purposes and should not
                                be publicized. Also in prospect is a “National Reconciliation Plan”
                                to induce middle and high level officers of the Viet Cong and the
                                National Liberation Front (<gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>),

                                rights. However, for program planning purposes, there may not be too
                                many exploitable results right away.</p>

                                frequent enemy attacks on schools and assassination of teachers—the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has managed to expand
                                educational facilities in rural areas with the aid of the U.S. and
                                other countries. Plans for 1967 include 3,400 new school-rooms,
                                4,000 additional teachers, 8 million more textbooks. The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has started a new University of
                                the South, the first in the Mekong delta. This may be worth
                                following. In the past two years some students have joined a number
                                of programs in support of the “Other War.”</p>

                            <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>For several months I have considered the need of establishing a regular
                            channel of communication to Country Public Affairs Officers, and have
                            explored various ways of bringing ideas and viewpoints to your
                            attention. With the new year I have decided to institute a monthly
                            letter to accomplish this purpose. I hope that it proves to be of value
                            to all.</p>
                        <p>I have just returned from a <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>
                            conference in Mexico City and visits with the staffs in five Latin
                            American countries. As always on my trips to the field, I felt refreshed
                            by personal contact with those who are doing the Agency’s work abroad.
                            While time does not permit me to travel as frequently as I should like,
                            I hope that these monthly letters will help to keep us in closer
                            touch.</p>
                        <p>This month I want to talk with you about a subject that is uppermost in
                            our minds here in Washington, the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System
                                (<gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss>).<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">See <ref target="#d108fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    108</ref>.</note> Those of you in the 39 countries in which the
                            system is now being introduced will be much concerned with it in the
                            coming weeks. Those of you in other countries should also be well
                            informed about <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> and its
                            significance for the Agency.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the new system is to help us—you as Country <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>, your Area Assistant Director and
                            myself in Washington—ensure that we make most effective use of resources
                            to accomplish our aims. This requires clear definition of objectives and
                            systematic analysis of alternative ways to reach these objectives. It
                            means weighing possible approaches against one another to determine
                            which are likely to bring greatest results for the funds expended. It
                            means better use of research to guide program judgments.</p>
                        <p>You should know that the PPB system is being instituted throughout the
                            Executive Branch of the government at the express direction of the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>We have in recent months been exploring ways to see how best we could
                            apply <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> within the Agency. It soon
                            became clear that since Agency programs stem from field needs, the field
                            program must <pb n="406" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_406"/>be the basis for
                            our analysis. After preliminary work in Washington, the Agency
                            pre-tested the Country Plan Program Memorandum (<gloss target="#t_CPPM_1">CPPM</gloss>) in Turkey and Japan. As a result of
                            lessons learned in these two posts, the revised handbook was
                            prepared.</p>
                        <p>The system is still in an experimental stage. Based on the experience
                            that we gain from the 39 posts which are participating this spring,
                            further improvements and refinements will be made.</p>
                        <p>We should realize that <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> will not
                            provide easy answers to difficult questions. All of us experienced in
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> recognize that results are
                            hard to evaluate and often involve intangibles that cannot be measured
                            precisely. <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss>

                            Officers.</p>
                        <p>I am very conscious of the fact that <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> will place additional demands upon the posts,
                            especially in this first year. It should, however, help us to
                            concentrate upon essentials and thus ultimately to reduce our
                            work-load.</p>
                        <p>I want you to know that we have been commended by the Bureau of the
                            Budget for the manner in which we have adapted <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> to our particular needs.</p>
                        <p>The work we have already done in inaugurating this new management tool
                            helped us to demonstrate to the Bureau of the Budget the value of our
                            activities. I am pleased to report that the Bureau has permitted us to
                            plan for selective increases in vital functions in our budget for the
                            coming year. You can see, therefore, that <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> is not just an academic exercise.</p>
                        <p>I look forward with keen interest to the field submissions, and to your
                            suggestions on how <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss> can best serve
                            the Agency.</p>

                        <p>These conditions would be: continued cessation of all military action,
                            including terrorism; suspension of all infiltration and movement toward

                        <p>Since the first shock of the <persName corresp="#p_SHE_1">Salisbury</persName> articles in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi> one month ago, free world media reaction may be divided
                            roughly into three stages, each one covering about ten days.</p>
                        <p>The initial outcry against U.S. bombing of North Viet Nam deplored
                            civilian casualties while denouncing official American statements for
                            not acknowledging them all along. This first burst of media reaction had
                            spent itself by January 6 and was followed by a lull which lasted until
                            mid-month. The third stage in the latter part of January produced a new
                            crop of editorials, with a growing number asking why severe critics of
                            occasional U.S. bombing accidents virtually ignored the Viet Cong’s
                            deliberate campaign of terrorism and murder. Some suggested that Hanoi
                            had skillfully exploited the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> to
                            divert world opinion from the basic realities of the war.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate the third stage, the following quotations from
                            representative papers are significant:</p>
                        <p>Hong Kong’s <hi rend="italic">China Mail</hi> said:</p>
                        <quote><p>The “accidental killing of North Vietnamese civilians in American
                                bombing raids has been widely publicized and criticized,” but
                                “strangely, the critics are generally silent when South Vietnamese
                                civilians are brutally put to death by Viet Cong guerrillas whose
                                operations are directed from Hanoi.” The paper referred to the
                                recent “massacre of 41 men, women, and children in the Mekong
                                delta.”</p></quote>
                        <p><pb n="409" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_409"/>Amsterdam’s Catholic <hi rend="italic">Volkskrant</hi> warned:</p>
                        <quote><p>“Emotional involvement with the Vietnamese war can easily lead to
                                placing the charge of cruelty at the wrong doorstep.” It said that
                                the latest “ruthless actions” of the Viet Cong against
                                non-combatants were “basic Viet Cong strategy.”</p></quote>
                        <p>In Milan, <hi rend="italic">Corriere della Sera</hi>, one of Italy’s most
                            influential dailies, said:</p>
                        <quote><p>“The truth is that the Americans could win if they really were
                                barbaric, terroristic, atrocious. The truth is that they are none of
                                these things and they never will be.”</p></quote>
                        <p>I am sending a copy of this memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_CGE_1">George Christian</persName> with the hope that he can use it for

                            (IUS) and Budapest (WFDY). It was against this background that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> in early 1950s began providing

                            discussions with friendly foreign officials:</p>
                        <p>a. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> support for <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> began at height of cold war, when
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was seeking to dominate
                            international youth movements with Party-picked<note n="7" xml:id="d132fn7">Reference is to the Communist Party of the Soviet
                                Union</note> and financed delegates. Aforementioned article by
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJB_1">James Reston</persName> developed this,
                            pointing out communist delegations gained control of key positions at
                            first World Students Congress in Prague in 1946 and notes inter alia
                            that first Soviet Vice President of International Union of Students was
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAN_1">Aleksandr Shelepin</persName>, later
                            chairman Soviet State Security Committee (<gloss target="#t_KGB_1">KGB</gloss>). Dept also preparing fuller summary for background
                            info of posts.</p>
                        <p>b. At that time, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was only source of
                            funds to enable American students to participate on equal basis in
                            international youth activities.</p>
                        <p>c. Student groups from all countries obviously require and receive
                            extensive financial support. In totalitarian countries, it generally
                            known that delegations are financed by government or ruling party and
                            that delegates have no alternative but to advocate official government
                            line. From some free world countries, youth delegations are customarily
                            sponsored and chosen by dominant political party. Covert support of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> student activities in
                            international field had obvious disadvantages, as noted in background
                            quoted reftel, but had advantage permitting students express own opinion
                            without government interference.</p>
                        <p>d. American delegates to international conferences have in fact
                            traditionally expressed their own views irrespective of official <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy.</p>
                        <p>e. Knowledge of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> support limited to
                            very few <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> officials, hence
                            disclosure this past association carries no implication that all
                            American youth active in student work were witting beneficiaries of
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> assistance. (Many such former
                            youth leaders are now active in government; among those now in Foreign
                            Service and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_RJB_1">Reston</persName> article mentions <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Ambassador to Chile <persName corresp="#p_DRA_1">Dungan</persName>, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> Director in <pb n="415" facs="0456" xml:id="pg_415"/>Peru <persName corresp="#p_DWT_1">William Dentzer</persName>, and
                            special assistant to Director of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            Robert Smith.) It also totally unfounded to assume that students active
                            in <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss>, with or without knowledge
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> support, maintained continuing
                            association with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> after student
                            days. (Front page Washington Post article Feb. 15 quotes unnamed <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> officers to effect that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> recruited agents from top echelons of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> over period of fourteen
                            years.)</p>
                        <p>f. Covert <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding should not be
                            confused with other student activities with which agencies of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, including State, have been and are
                            openly associated. Resume of activities which Department’s Bureau of

                        <p>Excuse my typing. <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Zbig Brzezinski</persName>
                            of the State Department called this evening with an idea that I think is
                            worth passing on for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>In all the ruckus about the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the
                            student groups they have sponsored over the past ten or twelve years, no
                            one occupying a high position in government has been heard to say that
                            the students did, <pb n="417" facs="0458" xml:id="pg_417"/>in fact,
                            perform a great service for their country. It is unfortunate that no
                            other funds were available to assist them in taking part in
                            international activities, than covert funds. But quarrels over the
                            method of supporting these groups ought not to diminish our gratitude
                            for what they did for the United States.</p>
                        <p>They represented our people . . . not the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> . . . at hundreds of meetings abroad where, without
                            them, there would have been no American voice. They served in
                            international organizations, in committees and projects where the Soviet
                            Union was represented, where Europeans were represented, and where
                            plenty of third-world, uncommitted nations were represented.</p>
                        <p>If it is true . . . as I believe it is . . . that traditional diplomacy
                            and powerful security forces cannot alone assure success in our
                            international operations, and that the opinions and commitments of youth
                            are critically important to us, then American students travelling abroad
                            to work, study, and take part in international meetings are essential to
                            our larger purposes. They help to build trust and understanding with
                            their contemporaries abroad in a way that diplomats find hard to match.
                            And they speak for democratic ideals and describe the American
                            experience in the councils of international youth groups, where without
                            them those ideals and that experience would have gone un-recognized or
                            would have been denounced.</p>

                            We will have permitted a bunch of phony muckrakers in the press and in

                                Skills</hi> and prepared by the Council’s staff, presented the
                            Council’s findings and recommendations regarding the so-called “Brain
                            Drain” issue. (See <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref>.) The
                            Council’s findings included: “the probability that there is a migration
                            of skilled personnel to the United States” despite inadequate U.S.
                            Government statistics; “any drain or gap which exists in developing
                            nations should be stemmed if it in any way runs counter to U.S.
                            developmental objectives;” the concern that “steps to regulate the
                            migration would be effective or would be in the best tradition of an
                            open society;” the “vast majority of aliens in scientific and
                            technological occupations enter the United States as immigrants for
                            permanent residence;” U.S. Government-sponsored J visa exchange visitors
                            programs “do not appear to be contributing significantly to the Drain;”
                            non-sponsored students are more likely to remain in the United States;
                            and “any drain or gap which may exist is caused primarily by the
                            migration of mature scientists, technical people, and other professional
                            personnel” and not exchange students. The Council also made
                            recommendations that no legal prohibitions be placed on entry into the
                            United States, and that certain remedial steps be taken for developing
                            countries facing a potential “brain drain” problem (including the U.S.
                            Government’s encouragement of countries to do more domestically to stem
                            the emigration of skilled workers, and to recruit these people “for
                            special job categories in the home countries”).</p>
                        <p>The following month, the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and
                            Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary convened hearings about
                            the issue on March 6 and 10. The hearings were entitled “International
                            Migration of Talent and Skills,” which was the same title as a June
                            14–15, 1966, conference that the Council held to “help diagnose the
                            so-called ‘Brain Drain’ problem and devise remedies.” (See <ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.) During the March 6 hearing,
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName>
                            addressed the relationship between U.S. Government-sponsored exchange
                            programs and “Brain Drain.” According to <persName corresp="#p_FC_1">Frankel</persName> and the Council: “In short, where the government
                            is involved, the drain is clearly controlled. Our exchange programs are
                            not self-defeating with respect to our efforts to assist the social and
                            economic development <pb n="419" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_419"/>of other
                            countries.” Although he cautioned that the government’s data to support
                            this “mainly reflects information about the exit from the United States
                            of Exchange Visitors,” he continued that he could report “with
                            reasonable accuracy that Exchange Visitors leave our shores.” (<hi rend="italic">International Migration of Talent and Skills: Hearings

                        <p>On October 6, the Council released a progress report on the “action taken
                            by the member agencies to carry out the Council’s own recommendations”
                            entitled “The Interagency Council and the ‘Brain Drain’ in Developing
                            Countries.” In the report, the Council documented what it was doing “to
                            administer the remedies” prescribed in <hi rend="italic">Some Facts and
                                Figures on the Migration of Talent and Skills</hi>. The report also
                            noted key actions that were taken including: “closing the information
                            gap;” “assisting foreign governments to stem the drain;” “emphasizing
                            educational development abroad and regional training;” “dealing with the
                            medical portion of the drain;” “improving the selection, counseling and
                            placement of foreign students;” and “expanding and intensifying
                            activities in the area of manpower surveys and educational planning.”

                            anticipate that it will be possible to report our conclusions and
                            recommendations early next month.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">The final

                        <p><pb n="420" facs="0461" xml:id="pg_420"/>In the interval, there are
                            certain basic facts with respect to past activities of the Central
                            Intelligence Agency in this area which should be underscored.</p>
                        <p>When the Central Intelligence Agency lent financial support to the work
                            of certain American private organizations, it did not act on its own
                            initiative but in accordance with national policies established by the
                            National Security Council in 1952 through 1954. Throughout it acted with
                            the approval of senior interdepartmental review committees, including
                            the Secretaries of State and Defense or their representatives. These
                            policies have, therefore, been in effect under four Presidents.</p>
                        <p>The support provided by the Central Intelligence Agency enabled many
                            far-sighted and courageous Americans to serve their country in times of
                            challenge and danger to the United States and the free world.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Central Intelligence Agency has been, and continues to
                            be, indispensable to the security of this nation. It is vitally
                            important that the current controversy over its support of certain
                            private organizations not be permitted to obscure the value, or impede
                            the effectiveness, of competent and dedicated career officials serving
                            this country.</p>

                                to examine the relationship between the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and the student groups. (J.Y. Smith and John
                                Maffre, “U.S. to Review Agency-Student Links,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, February 16, 1967, p. A1; and John

                        <p>However, the announcement that new rules have been adopted is unlikely by
                            itself to remove doubts, or to eliminate the cloud of suspicion that
                            will surround <hi rend="italic">all</hi> U.S. educational and cultural
                            programs, whether public or private, for some time to come. Moreover, a
                            solution that merely says what we will not do will not solve the
                            essential problems that the actions of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> were designed to solve—the problem of supporting
                            international exchanges at a proper level, and in a manner allowing us
                            to pursue long-range objectives free from immediate political
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>I would urge in the strongest terms, therefore, that the high-level
                            review now being conducted lead to the positive proposal of a new
                            framework for international educational and cultural affairs. Three
                            alternatives seem to me to be available.</p>
                        <p><pb n="422" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_422"/><hi rend="italic">Alternative
                                1:</hi> Turn over responsibilities to State/<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, and request a larger appropriation for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1968 to take care of these new tasks. A
                            rough estimate of additional appropriations needed is $8,976,000. (An
                            illustrative breakdown of this figure is attached at Tab A.)</p>
                        <p>This alternative has been widely proposed by Congressmen and
                            Senators—e.g., Congressman <persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Wayne
                                Hays</persName> and Senator <persName corresp="#p_JJK_2">Javits</persName>—and has been frequently mentioned in the press.
                            Legal opinion is that the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act
                            of 1961 (the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> Law)<note n="3" xml:id="d138fn3">See <ref target="#d14fn4">footnote 4, Document 14</ref>.</note>
                            provides full authority to State to provide open support to private
                            organizations engaged in international exchange activities.</p>
                        <p>In favor of this proposal are the following considerations:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) It is simple.</p>
                            <p>2) Favorable and reasonably quick action could be expected in
                                Congress.</p>
                            <p>3) <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> as an organization could absorb
                                this new function quickly and comfortably, since it has been
                                conducting parallel activities for some time.</p></quote>
                        <p>Against this proposal are the following considerations:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) Even though the State Department’s support is overt, the State
                                Department imprimatur, in the present atmosphere, will leave strong
                                suspicion, at home and abroad, that our intellectual, cultural and
                                youth activities are being subjected to political manipulation.</p>
                            <p>2) The overseas management of State’s exchange programs by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will reinforce this
                                impression.</p>
                            <p>3) The program will always be under some pressure from Congress and
                                other quarters to produce quick and obvious political results, and
                                to avoid “controversial” groups, individuals and themes.</p>
                            <p>4) The budgetary outlook will probably vary from uncertain to
                                bad.</p></quote>
                        <p>On balance, I regard this Alternative as feasible, and as better than the
                            status quo, but only as a very partial answer to the problem.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative 2:</hi> Create an American version of the
                            British Council,<note n="4" xml:id="d138fn4">See <ref target="#d116fn5">footnote 5, Document 116</ref>.</note> and turn over to it only
                            the kind of general organizational support activity previously conducted
                            by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>This idea has been in the wind for some time, and has been put forward
                            both within the Administration and by people outside. It essentially
                            proposes a semi-private corporation, supported by government funds, and
                            governed by a Board of Trustees chosen from the private sector.</p>
                        <p>In favor of this proposal are the following considerations:</p>
                        <quote><p>
                                <pb n="423" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_423"/>1) It will ensure open
                                control by the private sector, and particularly the educational
                                community.</p>
                            <p>2) It will insulate the activities supported against charges of
                                political manipulation.</p></quote>
                        <p>Against this proposal are the following considerations:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) It is too limited in scope, and will not repair the damage that
                                has been done to the whole spectrum of Government-supported exchange
                                activities.</p>
                            <p>2) It adds one more agency to a field of activity that is already
                                over-populated, and that is badly in need of simplification and
                                coordination.</p>
                            <p>3) It overlaps functions that could properly be conducted by the new
                                Center for Educational Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>) under the International Education Act of
                                    1966.<note n="5" xml:id="d138fn5">The Center for Educational
                                    Cooperation was never established.</note></p>
                            <p>4) It does not come to grips with the problem of our official
                                overseas representation in cultural affairs by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>—a problem that has been a
                                chronic source of trouble, and that, in the circumstances now
                                existing, is almost certainly going to get worse.</p></quote>
                        <p>On balance, I believe that this proposal is a move in the right
                            direction, but that it does not go far enough, and will not satisfy the
                            most important domestic or foreign critics.</p>

                            <p>3) All <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s long-range,
                                non-technical educational activities, including continuing

                            <p>4) All general support to private organizations of the kind

                            <p>5) All activities involving the counselling, assistance, placement
                                and repatriation of foreign students, whether Government sponsored
                                or not.</p>
                            <p>6) Art exhibits and presentations in the performing arts, including
                                the “reverse flow” to this country.</p><p>(Some of these activities
                                could be sub-contracted to other agencies: e.g., the Library of

                                sponsorship.)</p></quote>
                        <p>I. I suggest the following guidelines with regard to <hi rend="italic">the basic structure</hi> of such a Foundation.</p>
                        <quote><p>1) It should be governed by a Board of Trustees, composed of 15–25
                                members chosen from private life. The authorizing legislation should
                                probably provide that a majority of the group be representatives of
                                    <pb n="424" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_424"/>key voluntary and
                                educational organizations. (This is similar to the legislation for
                                the U.S. National Commission for <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss>.)</p>
                            <p>2) This Board, which might be called a “Grants Commission” to make
                                its functions clear, should have final authority for the expenditure
                                of all funds, as well as general supervisory authority over policy
                                and policy execution.</p>
                            <p>3) The Foundation should have a Director or Administrator, of
                                Under-Secretary rank, at the Executive Pay Level II or III. He
                                should have a Deputy at Executive Level V. Neither should be in a
                                Cabinet Department.</p>
                            <p>4) The Foundation should be free to receive private donations in
                                addition to Government appropriations.</p>
                            <p>5) The Committees of Congress to which it reports should probably be
                                the education committees.</p>
                            <p>6) It should be represented abroad by Cultural Affairs Officers
                                and/or Educational Officers, who are full members of the State
                                Department, but who carry the additional title, “Representative of
                                the Foundation for International Educational and Cultural Exchange.”
                                (This is similar to French representation in this country, and to
                                British representation in some countries.)</p></quote>
                        <p>II. The relationship of such a Foundation to other agencies now operating
                            will have to be carefully defined.</p>
                        <p>For purposes of general coordination, I would recommend that the Director
                            or Administrator of the Foundation be named Chairman of the Federal
                            Inter-Agency Council on International Educational and Cultural Affairs.
                            This Council, which is now the principal instrument of coordination in
                            the Government, and is chaired by the Assistant Secretary of State for
                            Educational and Cultural Affairs, should be upgraded in its authority
                            and altered in its composition. It should consist of the following
                            member agencies: (The proposed new members are starred.)</p>

                            technological gap. They are also deeply affected in their international
                            activities by the general U.S. posture with regard to exchanges, and by
                            our reputation for honesty in this field.</p>

                            will still be responsible for the exchanges of non-academic leaders and
                            specialists, which is the most immediately diplomatic-political aspect
                            of its present activities.</p>
                        <p>It would also be responsible for—and would be freer to devote its

                        <p>It would have, in addition, more direct control of and responsibility for
                            the corps of educational and cultural officers in our embassies. These
                            officers ought to be freer than they have been in the past to report on
                            events in their country. Under present conditions, they are excessively
                            preoccupied with other duties related to their <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> tasks. Although <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>
                            would be a smaller bureau with a smaller budget under these conditions,
                            its significance for <hi rend="italic">policy</hi> would be greater.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> would serve as the
                            transmission belt between the activities of the proposed Foundation and
                            our programs overseas.</p>

                            Center for Educational Cooperation in <gloss target="#t_HEW_1">HEW</gloss>?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> This Center would continue to be the
                            principal agency for stimulating and supporting the <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> U.S. effort in international studies. By creating a
                            parallel Foundation whose responsibilities are for overseas activities,
                            the fuzziness in the present situation would be removed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Question 3</hi>) What happens to <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> education programs?</p>

                            domain. More long-range activities, including activities that continue
                            after technical assistance ceases, would gradually be transferred to the
                            Foundation.</p>
                        <p>An essentially similar recommendation was made by <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">John Gardner</persName> in his <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and the

                        <p>In dealing with this problem, it would be a mistake, obviously, for the
                            Foundation to take over <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> activities
                            quickly. The transfer should be a planned one over a period of time.</p>

                                4</hi>) What happens to Cultural Affairs Officers?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> They would be transferred to State. State
                            now reimburses <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, from <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> appropriations, for approximately 100
                            man-years (Americans) and over 200 man-years (foreign) for the conduct
                            of cultural affairs programs overseas. This provides a base for the
                            transfer of personnel. If and when other cultural activities—e.g.,
                            libraries, cultural centers—are transferred, adjustments in the present
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> budget could be made.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will undoubtedly take the position
                            that its entree and credibility will be adversely affected by such a
                            transfer. This does not come to grips with the fact that our cultural
                            activities are now adversely affected by their tie-up to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> overseas. Nor does it face the new
                            situation created by recent revelations, which make it imperative that
                            the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of our cultural activities be
                            spelled out visibly, dramatically, and in a new form.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, since State/<gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss>, under this
                            proposal, would also give up much of its authority, and various agencies
                            will change their responsibilities, this change will be only a part of a
                            larger picture, and cannot be construed as aimed at <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> alone.</p>
                        <p>Another and important advantage of this proposal is that it will remove
                            long-standing barriers to the recruitment of good Cultural Affairs
                            Officers. The best ones we have are dissatisfied with their present
                            situation, which requires them to report through Public Affairs
                            Officers. Outstanding figures like Cleanth Brooks, who served in London,
                            and Laurence Wylie, now in Paris, have said that they could not
                            recommend to any colleague that he repeat their experience.</p>
                        <p>Dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs has been expressed for
                            a number of years, and recently with increasing impatience, by the U.S.
                            Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs,
                            by the Board of Foreign Scholarships, and by outstanding representatives
                            of American higher education. The White House Conference on
                            International Cooperation specifically recommended both a
                            semi-autonomous Foundation, and the dissociation of cultural affairs
                            from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.<note n="7" xml:id="d138fn7">The White House Conference on International Cooperation was held

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> These plans would continue to be valid for
                            countries where there is a large private educational traffic with the
                            United States, or <pb n="427" facs="0468" xml:id="pg_427"/>where a large
                            number of Federal agencies are active in education, and require
                            coordination.</p>
                        <p>In smaller and medium-sized embassies, it would be appropriate to combine
                            the activities of the Cultural and Educational Officers. In large
                            embassies, according to the Ambassador’s desires, one could be
                            subordinate to the other.</p>
                        <p>In general, the above proposal would probably mean that we would not need
                            more than 30 Education Officers in overseas posts.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary:</p>
                        <p>In favor of this third alternative are the following considerations:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) It provides a visible guarantee of the integrity of all U.S.
                                exchange activities.</p>
                            <p>2) It brings together activities that belong together.</p>
                            <p>3) It deals across the board, rather than in an <hi rend="italic">ad
                                    hoc</hi> way, with the fundamental problem of government-private
                                cooperation.</p>
                            <p>4) It is based on similar proposals that have been put forward for
                                many years by the educational-scientific-cultural community, and
                                will remove most of the objections they have raised to existing
                                arrangements.</p>
                            <p>5) It puts exchange activities in a healthier setting—an educational
                                and long-range foreign policy setting rather than a propagandistic
                                and short-range setting. (In this connection, it would be useful,
                                though not absolutely essential, to explore the possibility of
                                five-year appropriations for such a Foundation.)</p></quote>
                        <p>Against this proposal are some obvious considerations:</p>
                        <quote><p>1) It is ambitious, and envisages major administrative changes.
                                There will be bureaucratic pushing and pulling.</p>
                            <p>2) It will probably lead to general debate, since it will require new
                                legislation.</p></quote>
                        <p>On balance, even these adverse considerations seem themselves to be
                            favorable consequences. I believe the Administration can turn what is
                            now an embarrassment into a major triumph for its credibility,
                            flexibility and imagination if it puts forward this idea.</p>

                        <p>All of us in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> take pride in the
                            growing recognition that our responsibility for direct communication
                            with foreign audiences is essential to the conduct of U.S. foreign
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>This recognition reflects awareness that public opinion exerts increasing
                            influence on governments throughout the world and reaches <pb n="431" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_431"/>beyond national boundaries. To achieve
                            its foreign policy goals, the United States must break down barriers of
                            misunderstanding; it must communicate effectively and persuasively with
                            other people on the many issues on which our security and welfare
                            depend.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, in an increasingly complex world society, our responsibilities
                            are growing. I thought that it would be useful at this time, for us in
                            Washington and you in the field, to review these responsibilities.</p>

                            Objectives</p>
                        <p>To guide overseas operations, we have established objectives for each
                            country program, stemming from the foreign policy objectives of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p><pb n="432" facs="0473" xml:id="pg_432"/>I find it helpful to consider
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Objectives in the following
                            three broad categories:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The United States as a nation</hi>. To achieve its
                            goals, the United States requires cooperation and often active
                            partnership with other countries. Their understanding of what we have
                            achieved and are seeking to achieve, inevitably colors their
                            interpretation of U.S. actions and intentions throughout the world. It
                            is imperative that they know the kind of nation we are—the facts about
                            our people, our governmental officials, our industrial, business,
                            political and labor leaders, our educators and cultural figures.</p>
                        <p>From this need derives <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s
                            fundamental responsibility to build understanding of the United States,
                            its institutions, culture, and ideals. Such understanding is a necessary
                            basis for the respect, confidence, and support that the U.S. world role
                            today requires. A sympathetic climate of opinion not only helps to
                            achieve immediate objectives; it can also keep alive common bonds that
                            may withstand or lessen serious political tensions.</p>
                        <p>Because the panorama of America is so broad, we must concentrate on <hi rend="italic">significant</hi> aspects most relevant for our
                            audiences in their total judgment of the United States. Where those who
                            disagree with us have distorted the truth, we must correct the record
                            and affirmatively present the facts. The values that our audiences
                            themselves prize, as well as the misconceptions they hold about the
                            U.S., should determine the points of emphasis in each country
                            program.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">International Issues and U.S. Policies</hi>. The
                            United States needs understanding and support on many international
                            issues. These may range from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and
                            the Kennedy Round<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">For information about the

                            Progress, and questions before the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>We in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must present the facts about
                            these issues clearly and cogently. When the U.S. needs active support
                            for its position, we seek to persuade not only governmental leaders who
                            have the power of action, but also influential elements of public
                            opinion who must support them.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">National Development</hi>. The United States is
                            today helping many developing countries to build the foundations of
                            independent, modern states, responsive to the needs of their people.</p>

                            U.S. effort. This may include:</p>

                            still with us, particularly in the developing countries where the threat
                            often takes the form of communist-supported insurgency. Our information
                            programs can help alert people to the dangers, and support efforts of
                            these nations to maintain their independence.</p>
                        <p>The Agency must, of course, operate here with considerable caution, and
                            recognize the limits of our capacities and responsibilities. While much
                            of our activity will be carried out in cooperation with local
                            organizations and governments, we should not attempt to substitute for
                            them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Program Priorities</p>
                        <p>Opportunities for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs far
                            outstrip our resources. The skill with which we set priorities in large
                            measure determines our effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>Priority need not go only to immediate objectives. Just as the goals of
                            the United States are both long and short range, so <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Objectives may be a combination of
                            both. Some of our most significant work requires time: change in
                            understanding and attitude often comes slowly. The fact that an
                            objective is long range, however, does not <pb n="434" facs="0475" xml:id="pg_434"/>obviate the need for precision in its
                            definition—nor for periodically evaluating progress toward its
                            accomplishment.</p>
                        <p>With rare exceptions our primary targets must be leaders, present and
                            potential. The commercial mass media often give us the opportunity to
                            reach not only leaders but also wider audiences. We should remember,
                            however, that our greatest effect comes from concentrating on those
                            individuals who wield influence in their own societies.</p>
                        <p>Our programs must be limited to those activities most likely to
                            contribute toward achievement of objectives. The work-load must be
                            realistic. We should not attempt more than we can competently
                            perform.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there must be no reverence for activities simply because they
                            have been carried on for many years. As conditions change, so must
                            programs be altered to meet current problems.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">New Challenges for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss></p>
                        <p>I am well aware that the Agency’s many and varied responsibilities place
                            exceptional demands upon our personnel.</p>
                        <p>To meet them, we need the highest standards of professional
                            competence.</p>
                        <p>We must be proficient in the arts of communication and the techniques of
                            the media. We must also be experts in understanding our audiences—their
                            cultural heritage, their aspirations and attitudes. To be a good
                            communicator requires an ability to listen and understand, as well as to
                            speak and inform.</p>
                        <p>Looking ahead, I see increasing demands upon us. The growing complexity
                            of issues around the world with which the United States is concerned;
                            the burgeoning of communications in an electronic age; the development
                            of new information techniques and media—all pose new challenges.</p>
                        <p>I particularly hope in the coming months to make significant progress
                            toward:</p>
                        <p>1. A more effective means of setting priorities for all Agency
                            activities. We must devise through the Planning, Programming and
                            Budgeting System a systematic means of analyzing the relative benefits
                            of different programs, making full use of research tools.</p>
                        <p>2. Reduction of marginal activities.</p>
                        <p>3. Higher quality of output.</p>
                        <p>4. Further definition of the Agency’s role in national development.</p>
                        <p>5. Exploration of new media techniques.</p>
                        <p>6. Increased professionalism of Agency personnel, both through
                            recruitment of talented new staff and through the training of career
                            officers to help each develop his abilities to the fullest.</p>

                            idea of the direction in which our study is going. Hence I enclose a

                            approval of the committee.</p>
                        <p>You might focus particularly on the two underlined recommendations on
                            pages 1 and 2 and the proposed Statement of Policy on page <pb n="436" facs="0477" xml:id="pg_436"/>4. The footnote is particularly
                                important.<note n="4" xml:id="d141fn4">Reference is to the footnote
                                on page 5 of the draft report (see <ref target="#d141fn3">footnote
                                    3</ref> above) which reads: “If the Statement of Policy is to be
                                effective, it must be rigorously enforced. In the judgment of this
                                committee, no current programs would justify any exception to this
                                policy. At the same time, where the security of the nation may be at
                                stake, it is impossible for this committee to state categorically
                                now that there will never be a contingency in which overriding
                                national security interests may require an exception—nor would it be
                                credible to enunciate a policy which purported to do so. We
                                therefore recommend that, in the event of such contingencies, the
                                interdepartmental review committee be permitted to make exceptions
                                to the Statement of Policy, but only where the overriding national
                                security interests so require; only on a case-by-case basis; only
                                where open sources of support are shown to be unavailable; and only
                                when such exceptions receive the specific approval of the
                                Secretaries of State and Defense. In no event should any future
                                exception be approved which involves any private educational,
                                philanthropic, or cultural organization.” An unknown hand crossed
                                out the word “private.”</note> I believe it fair to say that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRM_1">Dick Helms</persName> would wish more
                            leeway than the Policy allows and that <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">John
                                Gardner</persName> would prefer virtually no leeway at all. The

                            danger. I believe the footnote is acceptable to both Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName>—but they can speak for

                                paper, which he dated by hand “16 March ’67,” entitled “Implications
                                of a Policy Statement Prohibiting Covert Assistance to ‘Educational,
                                Philanthropic, or Other Voluntary Organizations.’” In the paper, he
                                stated: “For the most part I agree with the position taken in the
                                proposed report. I completely concur in the conclusion that covert
                                financial support to most of the organizations formerly supported by
                                the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> should be terminated, and I
                                have no objection to public announcement of this decision. I
                                continue, however, to be deeply concerned about the implications of
                                a public policy statement which categorically provides that after
                                December 31st, 1967, no further covert financial assistance will be
                                given to any ‘private educational, philanthropic or other voluntary
                                organization.’” He continued that a public announcement would
                                present the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> with “an impossible
                                dilemma” and he described an example: “Perhaps the best illustration
                                of this dilemma is RFE. I am convinced that with the best possible
                                cooperation from all concerned, it will take considerable time, if
                                indeed it is ever possible, to arrange alternative sources of
                                funding for RFE, via a Congressionally approved council or
                                foundation or otherwise. As a practical matter, in my opinion, it
                                will not be possible between now and December 1967 to provide RFE
                                with funds through covert channels which are adequate to permit it
                                to continue its activities until alternative sources of funds are
                                established. Therefore, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> will
                                almost inevitably be forced either to violate the wording of the
                                proposed policy statement by continuing covert support to RFE, or to
                                liquidate RFE entirely.” (Johnson Library, White House Central

                            a recommendation of a new funding mechanism for the reasons stated in
                            the report. (But we also thought it unwise for a committee on which

                        </opener>
                        <p>I am joining Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> in signing the
                            report of the committee on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            relations with private organizations on the assumption that it has been
                            decided as a matter of policy to accept what I believe are the probable
                            consequences of a public release of this report. I am writing, however,
                            to make sure that my views concerning these consequences have been made
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as the report recommends new measures of support for private
                            organizations, I am of course in total agreement. To the extent,
                            however, that the report constitutes public announcement of a policy
                            which will hereafter prohibit covert support to any of “the nation’s
                            educational or private voluntary organizations,” I believe that it
                            seriously jeopardizes the existence of certain existing resources of the
                                <pb n="438" facs="0479" xml:id="pg_438"/>Government, such as Radio
                            Free Europe, Radio Liberty and one or two other organizations, the value
                            and effectiveness of which have been reaffirmed over a period of many
                            years. In my opinion the proposed policy statement will also curtail the
                            options available to the Government and its ability to react swiftly in
                            situations which may develop abroad,<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">Reference is to the political crisis in British Guiana during which
                                the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> began funding groups

                        <p>I recognize that the footnote<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">Reference is to
                                the footnote on page 5 of the report; see <ref target="#d141fn4">footnote 4, Document 141</ref>.</note> in the report is
                            intended to provide some leeway for future contingencies. It will be
                            difficult and probably impossible, however, to continue covert funding
                            for existing organizations such as RFE and Radio Liberty, particularly
                            in view of the searching and critical scrutiny which these organizations
                            are likely to receive as a result of publication of this report.
                            Moreover, I am doubtful that alternative sources of funding can be found
                            which will permit continued operation of these radios under
                            circumstances which will ensure that they are neither official organs
                            like the Voice of America nor vehicles for the uninhibited expression of
                            emigre opinion.</p>
                        <p>I have suggested alternative language to the committee which, in my
                            opinion, would achieve the objectives desired for the report without
                            tying our hands or involving risks of future embarrassment. Although the
                            other two members of the committee did not agree with my recommendation,
                            it is still my view that the report should be so worded as to feature a
                            policy of support for the foreign activities of genuinely private
                            organizations and the need for a new quasi-official instrumentality
                            through which such support can be channelled. The problem of clarifying
                            the Government’s attitude towards <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            relationships with private institutions would be adequately covered by a
                            brief factual statement. I believe that the report should simply confirm
                            the fact that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> is proceeding to
                            disengage from all domestic educational or private voluntary
                            organizations as rapidly as the national security permits under the
                            direction of a substantially strengthened interagency control mechanism
                            which involves the personal participation of the Secretaries of State
                            and Defense as appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Such a statement has the advantage of being factually accurate. It
                            provides reasonable assurance to critics of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> programs that firm action has been taken to liquidate
                            activities which they find objectionable. It contains no admissions or
                            commitments which are not fully compatible with the dignity and
                            prerogatives of the Government.</p>
                        <p><pb n="439" facs="0480" xml:id="pg_439"/>I am attaching proposed
                            rewording of the report along the lines suggested above.</p>
                        <p>If you decide to release the report substantially in its present form, we
                            will immediately study the problem which the report poses for the
                            continuation of RFE and Radio Liberty. I would like to be able to give a
                            neat solution, but the complex of factors involved will require time to
                            work out. Possible alternative sources of funding, the implications of
                            the status and legal composition of the radios and the problem of
                            arrangements adequate to ensure control of broadcasting policy will all
                            have to be examined.</p>
                        <p>These are perplexing questions and, particularly if alternative sources
                            of funds must be found, are unlikely to be resolved prior to December
                            31, 1967, the cut-off date established in the report for termination of
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> support for private
                            organizations. Therefore, I believe that there should be at least some
                            relaxation in the time which the report allows to <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to accomplish liquidation of these
                            relationships.</p>

                                responsibility for overseeing and assisting in the implementation of

                                recent wave of disclosures and assertions, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had initiated and pursued efforts to disengage from
                                much of this activity. Total disengagement should proceed as rapidly
                                as circumstances affecting the national security permit and
                                responsibility for overseeing and assisting in the implementation of
                                this policy should be entrusted to a strengthened interdepartmental
                                review committee with personal participation by the Secretaries of
                                State and Defense as appropriate.</p>

                            <p>I think it would be wise if I backgrounded the press at the time the
                                report is released. While I think that the report speaks for itself,
                                a backgrounder would insure a common interpretation and
                                understanding of its provisions.</p>
                            <p>As you know, I took it to be the function of our small committee to
                                review only one small aspect of <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                                operations—the covert support it has been giving for many years to
                                domestic private organizations which operate programs abroad. I have
                                no doubt that these programs performed a useful and necessary
                                function. I believe that many of them could today be overtly
                                financed by the Government. Others can be continued within the
                                policy of the committee by shifting financing abroad.</p>
                            <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GJW_1">Gardner</persName> and I
                                strongly believe that it is necessary for the report to state a firm
                                policy with respect to these domestic organizations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName> fully understands and
                                appreciates the reasons for such a policy. From the point of view of
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> operations, he would prefer
                                more flexibility and latitude, but appreciates the force of the
                                arguments made in the report. He believes <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> can “live with” this policy, as presently modified,
                                and has therefore signed the report.</p>

                            </opener>
                            <p>The committee which you appointed on February 15, 1967 has sought,
                                pursuant to your request:</p>
                            <p>—To review relationships between government agencies, notably the
                                Central Intelligence Agency, and educational and private voluntary
                                organizations which operate abroad; and</p>
                            <p>—To recommend means to help assure that such organizations can play
                                their proper and vital role abroad.</p>
                            <p>The committee has held a number of meetings, interviewed dozens of
                                individuals in and out of government, and reviewed thousands of
                                pages of reports. We have surveyed the relevant activities of a
                                number of federal agencies. And we have reviewed in particular and
                                specific detail the relationship between <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> and each relevant organization.</p>

                            <p>In summary, the committee offers two basic recommendations:</p>
                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">It should be the policy of the United States
                                    Government that no federal agency shall provide any covert
                                    financial assistance or support, direct or indirect, to any of
                                    the nation’s educational or private voluntary
                                organizations</hi>.</p>
                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Government should promptly develop and
                                    establish a public-private mechanism to provide public funds
                                    openly for overseas activities of organizations which are
                                    adjudged deserving, in the national interest, of public
                                    support</hi>.</p>
                            <p rend="center">1: <hi rend="italic">A NEW POLICY</hi></p>
                            <p>The years immediately after World War II saw a surge of communist
                                activity in organizations throughout the world. Students,
                                scientists, veterans, women and professional groups were organized
                                into interna<pb n="446" facs="0487" xml:id="pg_446"/>tional bodies
                                which spoke in the cadences, advocated the policies, and furthered
                                the interests of the communist bloc. Much of this activity was
                                organized, directed, and financed covertly by communist
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>American organizations reacted from the first. The young men and
                                women who founded the United States National Student Association,
                                for example, did so precisely to give American youth the capacity to
                                hold their own in the international arena. But the importance of
                                students as a force in international events had yet to become widely
                                understood and <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> found it
                                difficult to attract private support for its international
                                activities. Accordingly, the United States Government, acting
                                through the Central Intelligence Agency, provided support for this
                                overseas work.</p>
                            <p>We have taken <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> as an example.
                                While no useful purpose would be served by detailing any other
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> programs of assistance to
                                private American voluntary organizations, one fundamental point
                                should be clearly stated: such assistance was given pursuant to
                                National Security Council policies beginning in October, 1951 and
                                with the subsequent concurrence of high-level senior
                                interdepartmental review committees in the last four
                                Administrations. In December, 1960, in a classified report submitted
                                after a year of study, a public-private Presidential Committee on
                                Information Activities Abroad specifically endorsed both overt and
                                covert programs, including those assisted by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>.<note n="6" xml:id="d144fn6">This
                                    committee was also referred to as the Sprague
                                Committee.</note></p>
                            <p>Our study, undertaken at a later time, discloses new developments
                                which suggest that we should now re-examine these policies. The
                                American public, for example, has become increasingly aware of the
                                importance of the complex forms of international competition between
                                free societies and communist states. As this awareness has grown, so
                                have potential sources of support for the overseas work of private
                                organizations.</p>
                            <p>There is no precise index to these sources, but their increase is
                                suggested by the growth in the number of private foundations from
                                2,220 in 1955 to 18,000 in 1967. Hence it is increasingly possible
                                for organizations like <gloss target="#t_NSA_1">NSA</gloss> to seek
                                support for overseas activities from open sources.</p>
                            <p>Just as sources of support have increased, so has the number of
                                American groups engaged in overseas work. According to the Agency
                                for International Development, there has been a <hi rend="italic">nine-fold</hi> increase just among voluntary organizations
                                which participate in technical assistance abroad, rising from 24 in
                                1951 to 220 in 1965. The total of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> private
                                American voluntary groups now working overseas may well exceed a
                                thousand.</p>
                            <p><pb n="447" facs="0488" xml:id="pg_447"/>The number of such
                                organizations which has been assisted covertly is a small fraction
                                of the total. The vast preponderance have had no relationship with
                                the government or have accepted only open government funds—which
                                greatly exceed funds supplied covertly.</p>
                            <p>The work of private American organizations, in a host of fields, has
                                been of great benefit to scores of countries. That benefit must not
                                be impaired by foreign doubts about the independence of these
                                organizations. <hi rend="italic">The committee believes it is
                                    essential for the United States to underscore that independence
                                    immediately and decisively</hi>.</p>
                            <p>For these reasons, the committee recommends the following:</p>

                            <p>We believe that, particularly in the light of recent publicity,
                                establishment of a clear policy of this kind is the only way for the
                                government to carry out two important responsibilities. One is to
                                avoid any implication that governmental assistance, because it is
                                given covertly, is used to affect the policies of private voluntary
                                groups. The second responsibility is to make it plain in all foreign
                                countries that the activities of private American groups abroad are,
                                in fact, private.</p>
                            <p>The committee has sought carefully to assess the impact of this
                                Statement of Policy on <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>. We have
                                reviewed each relevant program of assistance carried out by the
                                Agency in case-by-case detail. As a result of this scrutiny, the
                                committee is satisfied that application of the Statement of Policy
                                will not unduly handicap the Agency in the exercise of its national
                                security responsibilities. Indeed, it should be noted that, starting
                                well before the appearance of recent publicity, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> had initiated and pursued efforts
                                to disengage from certain of these activities.</p>
                            <p>The committee also recommends that the implementation of this policy
                                be supervised by the senior interdepartmental review committee <pb n="448" facs="0489" xml:id="pg_448"/>which already passes on
                                proposed <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> activities and which
                                would review and assist in the process of disengagement.<note n="9" xml:id="d144fn9">If the Statement of Policy is to be effective,
                                    it must be rigorously enforced. In the judgment of this
                                    committee, no programs currently would justify any exception to
                                    this policy. At the same time, where the security of the nation
                                    may be at stake, it is impossible for this committee to state
                                    categorically now that there will never be a contingency in
                                    which overriding national security interests may require an
                                    exception—nor would it be credible to enunciate a policy which
                                    purported to do so. <hi rend="italic">We therefore recommend
                                        that, in the event of such unusual contingencies, the
                                        interdepartmental review committee be permitted to make
                                        exceptions to the Statement of Policy, but only where
                                        overriding national security interests so require; only on a
                                        case by case basis; only where open sources of support are
                                        shown to be unavailable; and only when such exceptions
                                        receive the specific approval of the Secretaries of State
                                        and Defense. In no event should any future exception be
                                        approved which involves any educational, philanthropic, or
                                        cultural organization.</hi> [Footnote is in the

                            <p rend="center">2: <hi rend="italic">NEW METHODS OF SUPPORT</hi></p>
                            <p>While our first recommendation seeks to insure the independence of
                                private voluntary organizations, it does not deal with an underlying
                                problem—how to support the national need for, and the intrinsic
                                worth of, their efforts abroad.</p>
                            <p>Anyone who has the slightest familiarity with intellectual or youth
                                groups abroad knows that free institutions continue to be under
                                bitter, continuous attack, some of it carefully organized and
                                well-financed, all of it potentially dangerous to this nation.</p>
                            <p>It is of the greatest importance to our future and to the future of
                                free institutions everywhere that other nations, especially their
                                young people, know and understand American viewpoints. There is no
                                better way to meet this need than through the activity of private
                                American organizations.</p>
                            <p>The time has surely come for the government to help support such
                                activity in a mature, open manner.</p>
                            <p>Some progress toward that aim already has been made. In recent years,
                                a number of federal agencies have developed contracts, grants, and
                                other forms of open assistance to private organizations for overseas
                                activities. This assistance, however, does not deal with a major
                                aspect of the problem. A number of organizations cannot, without
                                hampering their effectiveness as independent bodies, accept funds
                                directly from government agencies.</p>
                            <p>The committee therefore recommends that <hi rend="italic">the
                                    Government should promptly develop and establish a
                                    public-private mechanism to provide public funds openly for
                                    overseas activities of organizations which are adjudged
                                    deserving, in the national interest, of public support.</hi></p>
                            <p><pb n="449" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_449"/>Such a mechanism could take
                                various forms. One promising proposal, advanced by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BER_1">Eugene Black</persName>, calls for a publicly
                                funded but privately administered body patterned on the British
                                    Council.<note n="10" xml:id="d144fn10">See <ref target="#d116fn5">footnote 5, Document 116</ref>.</note></p>
                            <p>The British Council established in 1934, operates in 80 countries,
                                administering approximately $30,000,000 annually for reference
                                libraries, exhibitions, scholarships, international conferences, and
                                cultural exchanges. Because 21 of its 30 members are drawn from
                                private life, the Council has maintained a reputation for
                                independence, even though 90 percent of its funds are
                                governmental.</p>
                            <p>According to the <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> Directory
                                of Cultural Relations Services, other nations have developed
                                somewhat similar institutions. The Indian Council for Cultural
                                Relations, for example, is entirely government-financed but operates
                                autonomously. The governing body of the Swedish Institute for
                                Cultural Relations consists of both government and private members.
                                This institute receives 75 percent of its funds from the government
                                and the remainder from private contributions.</p>
                            <p>The experience of these and other countries helps to demonstrate the
                                desirability of a similar body in the United States, wholly or
                                largely funded by the federal government. Another approach might be
                                the establishment of a governmental foundation, perhaps with links
                                to the existing Federal Inter-Agency Council on International
                                Education and Cultural Affairs.</p>
                            <p>Such a public-private body would not be new to the United States.
                                Congress established the Smithsonian Institution, for example, more
                                than a century ago as a private corporation, under the guardianship
                                of Congress, but governed by a mixed public-private Board of
                                Regents.</p>
                            <p>The committee began a preliminary study of what might be the best
                                method of meeting the present need. It is evident, however, that,
                                because of the great range both of existing government and private
                                philanthropic programs, the refinement of alternatives and selection
                                among them is a task of considerable complexity. Accordingly, we do
                                not believe that this exclusively governmental committee is an
                                appropriate forum for the task and we recommend, instead, the
                                appointment of a larger group, including individuals in private life
                                with extensive experience in this field.</p>
                            <p>The basic principle, in any event, is clear. Such a new institution
                                would involve government funds. It might well involve government
                                officials. But a premium must be placed on the involvement of
                                private citizens and the exercise of private judgments, for to be
                                effective, it would have to have—and be recognized to have—a high
                                degree of independence.</p>

                        <p>In several limited war and insurgency situations where the United States
                            is directly involved, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is
                            performing tasks that place severe strains on its resources. Some of
                            these tasks appear to lie outside the Agency’s appropriate sphere of
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>In a number of countries <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> has been
                            aiding, or indeed leading, host government efforts to immunize its
                            population against threats of subversion and to strengthen the
                            government’s own appeal to its citizens. In Vietnam, the Agency has
                            taken on extensive responsibility for the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>’s information program, as well as for the entire U.S.
                            psychological warfare effort. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            Bangkok devotes a major portion of its activities to supporting joint
                            Thai-U.S. counterinsurgency programs in rural northeast Thailand. In
                            Laos, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> is in effect the Ministry
                            of Information for the Royal Lao Government.</p>
                        <p>These three country operations absorb nearly fifteen percent of the
                            Agency’s resources available for overseas programming. In <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1967 the Agency has budgeted $87 million
                            for country programs (<gloss target="#t_GOE_1">GOE</gloss>, salaries,
                            media support, administrative support and special foreign currency). The
                            total for Vietnam, Thailand and Laos is $12 million. Of the Agency’s
                            approximately 1,200 U.S. and 6,000 local employees serving abroad, 184
                            Americans and 717 locals are serving in these three countries. The
                            programs require a particularly large number of middle grade officers, a
                            large proportion of whom must also receive a minimum of ten months’
                            language training. The result is that 20 to 25 percent of the Agency’s
                            grade 4 and 5 officers are either stationed in one of these countries or
                            in the training pipeline for assignment there. It is estimated that by
                                mid-<gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> ’70 the Agency’s present
                            supply of eligible middle grade officers will have been selected for
                            service in these countries.</p>
                        <p><pb n="455" facs="0496" xml:id="pg_455"/>These activities impose a severe
                            burden upon Agency resources in personnel and funds.</p>
                        <p>The basic document defining the Agency’s role in insurgency situations is
                            the “U.S. Overseas Internal Defense Policy” (OIDP), approved by the
                            President in <gloss target="#t_NSAM_1">NSAM</gloss> 182 of August 24,
                                1962.<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2"><gloss target="#t_NSAM_1">NSAM</gloss> 182 is printed in <ref target="frus1961-63v08#d105"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                counterinsurgency doctrine” and served as “basic policy guidance”
                                for government agencies, diplomatic missions, and military commands.

                            maturity.” The OIDP also provides that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> “assist the host government in its psychological

                                according to <gloss target="#t_NSAM_1">NSAM</gloss> 330: “The
                                responsibility of the Minister-Counselor for Public Affairs [a

                                direction of the U.S. Ambassador is here reaffirmed.”</note></p>
                        <p>With respect to statutory authority, the Agency is responsible under
                            Title V of the <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MKE_1">Mundt</persName> Act for the dissemination of
                            information “about the United States, its people, and its
                                policies.”<note n="5" xml:id="d147fn5">See <ref target="#d32fn9">footnote 9, Document 32</ref>. According to section 2 of the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SBK_1">Smith</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MKE_1">Mundt</persName> Act: “The Congress hereby
                                declares that the objectives of this Act are to enable the
                                Government of the United States to promote a better understanding of
                                the United States in other countries, and to increase mutual
                                understanding between the people of the United States and the people
                                of other countries. Among the means to be used in achieving these
                                objectives are—(1) an information service to disseminate abroad
                                information about the United States, its people, and policies
                                promulgated by the Congress, the President, the Secretary of State
                                and other responsible officials of Government having to do with
                                matters affecting foreign affairs.”</note> The General Counsel
                            believes that the term “its policies” is broad enough to cover the
                            Agency’s counterinsurgency and limited warfare activities.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Agency appears to have adequate authority, both by law and by
                            Presidential directive, for these operations. In each case there have
                            been valid reasons for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to step
                            into a crisis situation and attempt to meet it. The Agency has, however,
                            undertaken responsibili<pb n="456" facs="0497" xml:id="pg_456"/>ties
                            that in the long run could more appropriately and effectively be handled
                            by other U.S. government agencies or by the host government. And the
                            Agency has not planned sufficiently for phasing out of responsibilities
                            which, over an extended period of time, unduly tax its resources.</p>

                            Applying to Limited War and Insurgency Situations</p>
                        <p>a. As psychological adviser to the executive branch of the government
                            (see Agency’s statement of mission, Appendix A–2–IV<note n="6" xml:id="d147fn6">Attached but not printed is Tab A, Appendix A–2,
                                “Legal basis for <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                                operation.”</note>), <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has the
                            responsibility to <hi rend="italic">advise</hi> all agencies on the
                            public opinion aspects of their programs.</p>
                        <p>b. This advisory role includes psychological warfare programs (i.e.,
                            information activities directed at hostile forces or at populations
                            under hostile control). Normally the Agency’s role should be limited to
                            (1) supplying policy guidance, information about the local psychological
                            environment and advice to the appropriate military authorities, and (2)
                            aid in planning and designing the content of psywar materials.</p>
                        <p>c. The Department of Defense should be responsible for funding, manning
                            and equipping psychological warfare <hi rend="italic">operations</hi>.
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should direct or carry out
                            such operations only in an emergency when specifically instructed to do
                            so by the President. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts should
                            not engage in the actual production or distribution of psywar materials
                            except upon request of the military in a crisis situation, with specific
                            approval of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Washington, and until
                            military resources can be brought to bear.</p>
                        <p>This definition of responsibility is in line with the Presidential
                            statement of mission (Appendix A–Z–IV)<note n="7" xml:id="d147fn7">Attached but not printed.</note> which provides that the Agency
                            shall be responsible for overt public information programs abroad of all
                            U.S. government agencies except for Commands of the Department of
                            Defense.</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> assistance to foreign
                            government information programs aimed at defeat of subversive insurgency
                            normally will be limited to an advisory role—in planning, preparation of
                            materials, and training of personnel. Actual production or distribution
                            of materials for a foreign government will not be undertaken except in
                            crisis situations and with specific approval of the Agency.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> assistance to a foreign government
                            should include a definite time-table for its termination and posts
                            should report regularly to Washington on progress toward this goal.
                            Where an extended informa<pb n="457" facs="0498" xml:id="pg_457"/>tion
                            effort is required to suppress insurgency, a primary objective of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should be to help the local
                            government build up its own facilities to take over the task. In such
                            situations other appropriate government agencies (<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>,
                            Defense) should provide needed equipment, production facilities,
                            personnel, and training to the local government, with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> restricted to an advisory role.</p>
                        <p>e. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> advisory personnel for local
                            government information programs should be assigned only to central
                            information services and, if clearly necessary, to the chief regional
                            capitals. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should not provide
                            personnel to supplement local government information activity at the
                            provincial or local level. Nor should it provide personnel when overt
                            participation by foreigners will in the long run defeat the purpose of
                            the program (i.e., identification of the government with its own
                            people). In the latter case, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> should
                            fulfill U.S. responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Exceptions to this principle should be allowed only with specific
                            approval by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Washington, and
                            should be limited to emergency situations, again with a time-table for
                            termination of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> assistance.</p>
                        <p>f. Upon request, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> will assign
                            officers experienced in psychological operations to training programs
                            maintained by the Department of Defense, <gloss target="#t_OCO_1">OCO</gloss> or other U.S. government agencies. The Agency will
                            likewise maintain regular liaison with such training establishments by
                            providing sample materials, current country plans and occasional
                            lecturers in Agency doctrine and operations.</p>
                        <p>g. Area Assistant Directors should maintain regular liaison with major
                            military regional commands in their areas, preferably through periodic
                            visits. Participation in contingency planning should be considered on an
                            individual country priority basis.</p>

                                lengthier letter to Vice President <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> on the same day. In it, he stated that the
                                Advisory Commission members “are convinced that a basic problem is
                                one of funding and that existing authorities are not wholly
                                effective because of a lack of funds,” and “what is needed is much
                                greater visibility of these programs, and we welcome the opportunity
                                provided by the report of the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> panel to put down some of our thoughts on
                                this subject.” <persName corresp="#p_BHD_1">Babbidge</persName> also
                                noted “that any responsible citizen must recognize a need for an
                                intelligence-gathering operation in modern society and a similar
                                need for an apparatus to explain American foreign policy
                                overseas—both in its day-to-day operation and its long-range
                                effects. Nevertheless, both of these instrumentalities should be

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>The recent disclosures about the involvement of the Central Intelligence
                            Agency in international educational and cultural programs came as a
                            surprise and shock to the members of this Commission, as indeed they did
                            to large numbers of the academic community and the general public.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief that incalculable damage was done by the concealed
                            subsidies of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to American
                            participants in these programs. Questions have now been raised in the
                            minds of foreign scholars, intellectuals, and artists about the
                            objectivity, integrity, and independence of American foundations and the
                            role of any U.S. citizen abroad. Even persons connected with private
                            institutions, to say nothing of those having overt government grants,
                            have been tainted as possible agents of the American intelligence
                            community.</p>
                        <p>It is ironic that an intelligence agency, working covertly, found it in
                            the national interest to engage in programs which this Commission has
                            always underscored as a vital instrument of foreign policy. In our
                            annual and special reports we have long urged an increase in the size
                            and an improvement in the quality of the U.S. government’s international
                            educational and cultural programs. We have stated repeatedly, however
                            that only programs of academic validity and unquestioned <pb n="462" facs="0503" xml:id="pg_462"/>integrity can achieve the purpose for
                            which they are intended, namely, the promotion of mutual understanding
                            and the elimination of national stereotypes.</p>
                        <p>The Commission is pleased to note that many people in and out of
                            government have recognized that, as a result of the revelations of
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s activities, the time is now
                            ripe for decisive action and a great step forward toward the proper
                            support of present and ongoing programs.</p>
                        <p>We write to you in your capacity as chairman of the committee set up by
                            the President to consider the implications of the reports of the panel

                            quasi-public organization to become the main vehicle of educational and
                            cultural exchange of this government is surely a stride in the right
                            direction. In addition to the models proposed by the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> panel we suggest that
                            consideration also be given to the admirable Canada Council,<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">Reference is to the institution, also referred to

                                organizations. Although established by the Canadian Government, the

                            crucial tasks before you, please call on us.<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">In a July 12 letter to <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>, the new Chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission

                                agencies. The fundamental purpose of such an arrangement would be to
                                make the clearest possible distinction between cultural and
                                educational efforts as such and information or propaganda functions.
                                It is our thought that such a mechanism would take care of at least
                                some of the so-called ‘<gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> orphans’
                                and that the educational programs of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (for example, libraries as contrasted with reading

                        <p>On May 1, 1967, an extra-legal, unofficial tribunal, known as the
                            “International War Crimes Tribunal” and the “<persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> Tribunal,” initiated by the
                            British philosopher and political activist Bertrand Russell, was
                            convened in Stockholm, Sweden, to conduct an inquiry into possible
                            United States culpability in war crimes in Vietnam. Members of the
                            tribunal included French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, American
                            political activist Stokely <persName corresp="#p_CL_1">Carmichael</persName>, and American author James Baldwin. (Dana

                            tribunal and a transcript of remarks by the prominent American

                            Eric Severeid, both of which <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> received. According to the media reaction
                            analysis, “The world press generally have given only minor news
                            treatment to Bertrand Russell’s so-called ‘international tribunal on war
                            crimes,’ which opened in Stockholm this week.” (Johnson Library, White

                        <p>On May 8, both the United States Information Agency and the Department of
                            State sent reaction guidance in joint circular telegram 190249, in which
                            both agencies stressed to posts around the world: “The biased and
                            propagandistic nature of this project has been fully documented in the
                            press, so there is no reason for statements to this effect to be
                            attributed to U.S. officials, either for the record or on background. We
                            hope to avoid focusing attention on the tribunal, or raising its
                            stature, by making it the subject of official U.S. notice.” (Johnson

                                summarizing the May 5 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_SRS_2">Shriver</persName>. In it, <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> was “distressed to find so little knowledge
                                of American domestic activities by otherwise well-informed
                                Europeans.” <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>
                                suggested several ways to correct this, including expanding the
                                “leader grant program” to attract more young people; encouraging
                                U.S. Government officials “to travel abroad and attend meetings,
                                make speeches and be interviewed on radio and television”; and
                                “describing the work that we are now undertaking in relieving
                                poverty, improving education, controlling water pollution, traffic,
                                crime control, etc.” According to <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> called the meeting in order “to stimulate
                                activities in this field and that he would periodically request
                                reports on the progress being made.” A copy of <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>’ memorandum summarizing the
                                meeting is in the same file as his May 8 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>.</note></head>

                        <p>On Friday,<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">May 5.</note> Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> scheduled a meeting
                            with me, <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Nick Katzenbach</persName>, and
                            Sargent <persName corresp="#p_SRS_2">Shriver</persName> to discuss an
                            expansion of the information program in Western Europe and the need for
                            more speakers representing the Administration on “Great Society”
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting I suggested the following:</p>
                        <p>1. That Cabinet officials and Agency heads cooperate with me in meeting
                            the foreign press in New York at our Foreign Correspondents Center. Over
                            400 foreign correspondents are registered in New York and we have been
                            able to attract a substantial number when top-name speakers are
                            scheduled. The Vice President agreed to meet with this <pb n="465" facs="0506" xml:id="pg_465"/>group within the next two weeks, as did
                            Sargent <persName corresp="#p_SRS_2">Shriver</persName>. I will keep the
                            pressure on other Administration spokesmen to do likewise.</p>
                        <p>2. Our Public Affairs Officers in Western Europe will be instructed to
                            stimulate radio and television producers in their countries to visit the
                            United States in order to prepare documentaries on subjects such as
                            water pollution, urban renewal, low-cost housing, city planning and
                            traffic control. As an inducement, we will offer the cooperation of the
                            affected governmental agency in providing the necessary information and
                            guidance, as well as top-level spokesmen.</p>
                        <p>3. When Administration officials travel abroad, if they will give me
                            advance notice of their plans we will schedule them for interviews by
                            press, radio and television and conferences with significant local
                            groups. In the past we have not had advance notice and have been unable
                            to make the most desirable arrangements of this nature.</p>
                        <p>I am planning a two-day meeting with our Public Affairs Officers from all
                            of Western Europe on June 19–20 at Brussels.<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3"><persName corresp="#p_WWE_1">Weld</persName> summarized the

                            domestic programs when they return to Washington for home leave or
                            consultation. We now schedule intensive courses on the legislative

                            <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Among the many responsibilities of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, none challenges us more than communicating to foreign
                            audiences the American spirit and ideals, the reality of our people and
                            institutions. Selecting the most significant in the vast panorama of our
                            society requires a high order of knowledge and skill.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that understanding of our nation abroad must underlie the
                            successful conduct of U.S. foreign policy today.</p>
                        <p>The picture is richly varied and rapidly changing. Those of you who
                            return home after several years abroad note the dramatic pace of change
                            in twentieth century America. Just to cite two examples: our educational
                            system from Head Start<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">Reference is to the
                                educational program established by the Johnson administration
                                through the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1965. In remarks he
                                made on May 18, 1965, at the White House announcing the program,
                                President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> stated:
                                “Today we are able to announce that we will have open, and we
                                believe operating this summer, coast-to-coast, some 2,000 child
                                development centers serving as many as possibly a half million
                                children.” He noted: “These children will receive preschool training
                                to prepare them for regular school in September. They will get
                                medical and dental attention that they badly need, and parents will
                                receive counseling on improving the home environment.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, 1965</hi>, Book I, pp. 556–557)</note>
                            and pre-school through post-graduate study, is undergoing profound
                            transformations; the whole complex of programs, public and private, that
                            make up the war on poverty form a very different picture today from what
                            they did only two years ago.</p>
                        <p>In my March 6 letter<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">See <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> I divided <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> objectives into three broad categories, one of which
                            was building understanding of the United States as a nation. Let me
                            stress here a few points for your special attention.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Planning</hi>. Each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> has the responsibility to build into his country plan,
                            as the local situation demands, an appropriate objective on projecting
                            the United States. I consider this essential for two reasons. First, it
                            should ensure proper attention in programming. This is especially
                            important in the case of long-range activities that run the risk of <pb n="467" facs="0508" xml:id="pg_467"/>being swept aside by the more
                            immediate, unless they are given due weight in the country plan.</p>
                        <p>The second reason is selectivity. The panorama of the United States is
                            broad. With limited resources we must concentrate on those aspects that
                            are most significant and relevant. The starting point is the country
                            plan, with careful wording of objectives and themes.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Quality</hi>. As you know, the quality of all <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> work remains one of my chief
                            concerns. Here in Washington we have done much to raise our media
                            products to a higher standard of excellence. I have also given
                            considerable thought to the quality of our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> centers abroad—their physical appearance and the ways
                            in which they represent the cultural heritage of the United States. I
                            would like to feel that every visitor to a <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> center senses the spirit of our country and glimpses
                            something of the best that America has to offer.</p>
                        <p>We have taken important steps to improve the quarter’s of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> centers and binational centers; to
                            display in them fine examples of contemporary American graphic arts; and
                            to improve the holdings of our library collections. I also have in mind
                            other steps about which you will be hearing shortly.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Our human resources</hi>. Programs, media products,
                            buildings—all play a part, but none are so important as the human beings
                            who serve <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> abroad. How can we help
                            them to be well-rounded, knowledgeable representatives of America?</p>
                        <p>I realize that keeping abreast of developments in the United States is no
                            simple task, especially for our field officers who frequently work under
                            keen pressure. Nevertheless I am sure you agree that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should set and maintain the highest
                            standards for its personnel.</p>
                        <p>Part of this responsibility, of course, falls upon the Agency. We have
                            just completed a two-week field officers’ seminar on “Problem Areas of
                            Contemporary America.” We plan more such seminars in the coming months,
                            and have other projects in mind for training in Washington and at the
                            post. We welcome any suggestions you care to make.</p>
                        <p>While the Agency can help, however—and will increasingly in the
                            future—there is no substitute for the individual’s motivation and
                            determination. The chief responsibility must lie with each officer,
                            whether his sphere of operations is in exchanges, radio, press, or the
                            other media. It is up to him to take advantage of the many materials
                            that are available, from the wireless file to cultural packets,
                            newspapers, magazines and books.</p>
                        <p>You as Public Affairs Officer have a heavy responsibility to set an
                            example by your own efforts, and through your leadership to encourage
                            others.</p>
                        <p><pb n="468" facs="0509" xml:id="pg_468"/>I know I can count on you to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                                charged language, rhetorical adjectives, or an indignant tone in
                                refuting Arab charges. Refutation of those charges, however, will
                                continue.</p>
                            <p>(3) <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> will follow the lead of the
                                official U.S. position on rupture of relations. We regret the break

                        <p>We agreed that a prime problem will be Arab preoccupation with the

                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_UPI_1">UPI</gloss> despatch yesterday reported the

                        <quote><p>“Already their big propaganda guns were blasting away at the U.S.,
                                Britain and Israel in what London diplomats said would become one of

                        <p>There are other indications that this prediction will be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p>During the past week, Arab propaganda organs such as Radio Cairo and
                            Radio Damascus have engaged in a vituperative and vicious campaign to
                            discredit the United States. In addition to originating the “big lie”

                            name-calling and tactics reminiscent of Nazi Germany.</p>
                        <p>As I have previously reported, we have attempted to meet this challenge
                            by expanding all of our information services and concentrating on the
                            Middle East problem.</p>
                        <p>Since the press of the Arab world will not print our statements, the
                            Voice of America is the only effective tool available to us. We have
                            doubled the hours of broadcasting in Arabic and increased the French
                            language broadcasting to North Africa. We have emphasized and repeated
                            over-and-over our answers to the Arabic charges and to Soviet
                            accusations. Reports from the affected posts indicate a measure of
                            success.</p>
                        <p><pb n="471" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_471"/>In evaluating this situation, I
                            call your attention to the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Emotionally, the Arab world wants to believe the truth of the charges
                            and it is very difficult to overcome their historic deep-seated
                            bias.</p>
                        <p>2. Because the Arab world today is frustrated by the stunning defeat
                            administered to it by a handful of Israeli forces, they accept the “big
                            lie” and have made the United States a scape goat. U.S. officials
                            engaged in foreign policy matters may become frustrated because the “big
                            lie” will not be completely repudiated despite our most vigorous and
                            intensive efforts. In this frustration, they must not assume that the
                            media are inadequate—radio and press are merely tools, they are not
                            substitute for effective deeds, nor will they overcome historic
                            animosities, or emotional bias.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. <hi rend="italic">actions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi>
                            will speak louder than the words in a shortwave program. Accordingly, it
                            is vital that during the coming months our actions with reference to
                            Middle East problems be presented for the maximum impact on the Arab
                            world. These actions should be announced in such a fashion as to create
                            the greatest attention.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> does not make policy—it
                            reports it. However, unless we are fully informed during the time that

                        <p>The full Committee has not yet definitively expressed its views. But on
                            the basis of discussions to date, my assessment of what may emerge as
                            recommendations to you is summarized below.</p>
                        <p><pb n="473" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_473"/>1. We believe that the
                            Committee’s concern should not be limited to the so-called <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> orphans.<note n="5" xml:id="d156fn5">Reference is to what <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>, in its May 19
                                issue, called “the orphans”. “In current capital usage, the orphans
                                are the nearly 100 private agencies that had been getting <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> money and were left high and dry
                                by the White House order that all such undercover support must
                                cease—preferably by year’s end.” (“How to Care for the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Orphans,” <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>, May 19, 1967, pp. 42–43)</note> We have examined the
                            work of the three dozen voluntary organizations formerly funded by
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> (annual cost of about $15
                            million) and found some excellent work which deserved support. We have
                            also become aware of a much larger number (100–150) of private voluntary
                            organizations doing similar worthy work overseas.</p>
                        <p>2. The most interesting activities of voluntary organizations involve
                            institution building—helping to build overseas the kind of local
                            communities and private groups necessary to free and economically
                            successful societies. Private organizations have played an important,
                            and perhaps underestimated, role in our own national development. They
                            can be even more important in a number of developing countries. The
                            kinds of private organizations we are thinking about include: rural
                            cooperatives; adult literacy and family planning groups; labor groups;
                            youth and student organizations; credit unions and locally-run savings
                            and loan associations; businessmen’s organizations; and women’s
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>Since U.S. private organizations can work directly with like-minded
                            groups in other countries without having to go through official
                            government channels, they can often run experimental projects which deal
                            with sensitive activities—like fostering political literacy and birth
                            control, changing outmoded economic practices, and developing civic
                            attitudes. A few agencies, primarily <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and State, already contract with some private
                            organizations for specific projects programmed by the agencies. However,
                            it appears that we lose a great deal by not supporting work which the
                            organizations themselves initiate through their own channels.</p>
                        <p>3. Our examination indicates that the private organizations can make
                            small grants go a long way (most <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            grants were less than $250,000). Thus, a reasonable annual program might
                            run $20–30 million.</p>
                        <p>4. While we cannot be definitive at this point (only Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> of the eight
                            congressional members has taken an active part in the Committee’s work),
                            we believe that there could be significant political and congressional
                            support for the kind of initiative that reaches people and private
                            groups in other countries through U.S. private organizations, many of
                            which have large and influential memberships.</p>
                        <p><pb n="474" facs="0515" xml:id="pg_474"/>5. Organizationally, there would
                            be substantial advantage to separating such grant-making from existing
                            agencies and foreign policy considerations and placing it in a
                            bipartisan Commission of distinguished private citizens. This would
                            emphasize the private nature of the activities and permit support of
                            more sensitive and experimental activities. We envision a Commission
                            whose members and chairman would be appointed by the President and
                            confirmed by the Senate, with a staff of about 300. It would derive most
                            of its funds by appropriation and some from private donations, although
                            the latter would probably not be large.</p>
                        <p>6. We are also exploring transfer to such a commission of certain
                            existing academic and cultural exchange programs. Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> believes that such a shift
                            would benefit the exchange programs. This alternative would involve
                            transfer of about $60 million from existing agency budgets (primarily
                            State), in addition to the $20–30 million of new funds for “institution
                            building.”</p>
                        <p>I would be happy to discuss the matter with you if you believe it would
                            be helpful, and I will in any event keep you informed of further
                            developments in the Committee. We are proceeding to develop a final
                            report to you and a draft bill to embody our recommendations.</p>

                        <p>We are facing today the most serious problem in dealing with the press
                            stationed in Viet-Nam. Pessimism and criticism about the course of the
                            war is more pronounced today than at any time in the past two years.
                            There is a growing vocal doubt about the Presidential campaign,<note n="4" xml:id="d157fn4">The Presidential election in South Vietnam

                        <p>Correspondents are more critical in private conversations than in their
                            written dispatches, although the latter are sufficiently critical.</p>
                        <p>This situation has been brought about by complex reasons, including the
                            following:</p>
                        <p><pb n="476" facs="0517" xml:id="pg_476"/>A. The loss through reassignment
                            and summer vacations of the more experienced and mature correspondents
                            who have been replaced by a relatively new and young press corps in
                            Saigon.</p>

                                need for discrimination and evaluation of the many factors involved
                                in this conflict. Many of these correspondents have built-in doubts
                                and reservations which they brought with them from the United
                                States. Many are here on their first “big assignment” and have a
                                tendency to search for the critical story which might lead to a
                                Pulitzer Prize. Such stories are easy to find if reliance is placed
                                upon selfish interests and dissidents who seek
                            publicity.</p></quote>

                                inefficiency, a belief that the Presidential campaign will be little

                                the Vietnamese lack motivation.</p></quote>
                        <p>When I met with Prime Minister Ky and commended him on his patriotic
                            attitude in accepting the Vice Presidency to avoid a conflict within the
                            military, he thanked me but became quite indignant at a report filed by
                            R.W. Apple of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> which called
                            this move “a stunning defeat” for Ky.<note n="5" xml:id="d157fn5">See R.

                            done everything possible to keep Mr. Apple informed, had taken him
                            aboard his personal helicopter on trips so that he might have an
                            opportunity for a firsthand review of the war and political
                            situation—and yet Apple persisted in attempting to “bring him down.” He
                            threatened to throw Apple and other correspondents of that nature out of
                            the country. Prime Minister Ky repeated this accusation later that night
                            to a group of correspondents.</p>

                        <p>There are at the present time, 14,000 persons employed by the Vietnamese
                            Government to carry on an information program within Viet-Nam. I am
                            informed that funds for this operation are being provided by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>During the past year, I have stressed the importance of having <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> take over many of the functions which
                                <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> is currently providing in the
                            provinces and throughout Viet-Nam. Our efforts have been
                            unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p>When I met with General Tri, Minister of Information in charge of <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss>, I reminded him of the promises made
                            by him and by his predecessor, Minister Chinh, to fulfill this
                            responsibility and complained that no progress had been made. I told him
                            that it was apparent that relatively few of the 14,000 employees were
                            performing a valuable function and earning their salary. When I asked
                            him to give me his opinion of how many were doing their job, he replied
                            “about <hi rend="italic">50</hi>.” He frankly confessed that the others
                            were doing little or nothing, that they were incompetent, that he was
                            powerless to change the situation.</p>
                        <p>Despite his pessimism, on two previous occasions the <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> had responded to the challenge—during
                            the TET campaign and during the elections for the Constituent

                            received strong orders “from the top” and they carried out their
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>I raised the subject with Prime Minister Ky and Chairman Thieu and
                            received the polite promises to investigate the matter and do something.

                        <p>It is apparent that there is an ever-growing need for an expanded
                            information service within Viet-Nam, yet an inability or a reluctance by

                        <p>I raised the subject with Chairman Thieu who recalled our discussions in
                            Manila and reiterated his willingness to assist. He readily agreed that
                            there were “a dozen” competent Vietnamese who could be assigned to fill
                            this function and then asked if we would provide the funds for the
                            salaries and expenses required—about $500,000. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and I explained that the amount
                            was small and certainly within the resources of the Vietnamese
                            Government; however, we urged him to secure the personnel as soon as
                            possible and that if funds had to be provided, we would see what
                            arrangements could be made.</p>

                        <p>A. My investigation revealed that we are using our press, radio and
                            television facilities to good advantage. However, I am not satisfied
                            that we have done everything possible to carry out an information
                            program in <hi rend="italic">North Viet-Nam</hi>. Our intelligence
                            reveals that there are relatively few shortwave receivers in North
                            Viet-Nam and that most people listen only to their local stations and
                            that many are served by a central broadcasting service over which they
                            have no choice of programs.</p>
                        <p>B. The Voice of Freedom, operated by the Vietnamese with U.S. assistance,
                            is currently broadcasting about 12 hours per day. I have ordered an
                            increase to 24 hours per day. To enable the North Vietnamese to listen
                            to this station which has an excellent signal throughout the area, I
                            propose to have fixed-frequency radio receivers dropped in North
                            Viet-Nam. These sets will cost about $3.00 a piece and should provide
                            means of reaching a substantial audience.</p>
                        <p>C. The Voice of America is currently broadcasting to North Viet-Nam from
                            Hue about 12 hours a day. This schedule is being increased to 24 hours a
                            day effective next month.</p>
                        <p>D. Good progress is being made on the construction of land-based
                            television stations and the entire country will have this service before
                            the end of the year.</p>
                        <p>I am informed that there are in excess of 100,000 television receivers in
                            the hands of the public. I visited radio and television stores which
                            displayed Japanese, German and other sets. There is a brisk sale of
                            these receivers. However, I found, to my dismay, that no licenses had
                            been granted by the Viet-Nam Government for the assembly or manufacture
                            of television receivers in Viet-Nam. On my last visit to Saigon, this
                            subject was discussed with Prime Minister Ky and others who readily
                            agreed that these licenses should be issued to stimulate <pb n="479" facs="0520" xml:id="pg_479"/>local industry and to siphon off excess
                            purchasing power in the hands of the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>I raised the subject again with General Ky and Chairman Thieu who have
                            again promised to do something.</p>

                            little improvement in European reaction to the U.S. position in
                            Viet-Nam. Accordingly, I intend to continue the program of bringing
                            European journalists to Viet-Nam for firsthand study of the war and
                            non-military aspects.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I will send our <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss> to

                            committees and working groups. As a result, many of our officers are
                            devoting a great deal of time to meetings and liaison work which could
                            better be spent in carrying out their informational activity. I would
                            hope that there could be a simplification of the structure which now
                            houses <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_OCO_1">OCO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CORDS_1">CORDS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LEM_1">Locke</persName> is aware of this situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>There is an acute need for an expanded information service in Viet-Nam
                            between now and the September elections and continuing thereafter during
                            the transitional period to constitutional government. Despite this need,
                            little effort is being directed toward this end by the <gloss target="#t_VIS_1">VIS</gloss> and there is an apathy towards
                            correcting the situation. Similarly, there is a desperate urgency for
                            the Vietnamese story to be told by the Vietnamese in world capitals—and
                            yet little is being done. I have brought these matters to the attention
                            of the highest authorities and will continue to remind them of their
                            responsibilities in these areas.</p>

                                Several commentators stress the irony of the situation—because the

                                improve Negro welfare. Radio Moscow, predictably, has highlighted
                                news reports on the riots—and editorialized extensively on economic
                                weaknesses and class distinction as roots of disorder.”

                        <p>Editorial comment, moderate in volume, reported from widely separated
                            parts of the non-Communist world has reflected sympathetic understanding
                            of the complexities. The primary lines of thought emphasized most
                            frequently in the past ten days were:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. U.S. race relations are very serious and dangerous. Any
                                one-sided condemnation would be wrong because they are also very
                                complex.</p>
                            <p><pb n="481" facs="0522" xml:id="pg_481"/>2. The tragic situation is
                                “paradoxical” and “ironic” because the Johnson administration has
                                done far more than any other to improve the welfare of the
                                Negroes.</p>
                            <p>3. But much more progress is needed to give the Negroes equality.
                                What has been done is “like sprinkling water on thirsty soil.”</p>
                            <p>4. Therefore, the Negro extremists are, “unfortunately,” taking over
                                from the moderates.</p>
                            <p>5. Extremists such as Stokely <persName corresp="#p_CL_1">Carmichael</persName><note n="4" xml:id="d158fn4">Reference is
                                    to the American social activist, civil rights advocate, and
                                    member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Commitee, to whom
                                    the term “Black Power” is attributed.</note> believe that the
                                force of riots is necessary to stimulate faster progress for the
                                impatient Negroes. This is not surprising and they may be
                            right.</p></quote>
                        <p>Less conspicuous has been the view expressed in some commentaries that
                            the riots have little or nothing to do with the civil rights movement
                            but are created by lawless, hooligan elements that exist in every city
                            ready to destroy and loot whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>Mexico City papers told the U.S. riot story in banner headlines, detailed
                            dispatches, pictures, editorials and cartoons.</p>
                        <p>Conservative <hi rend="italic">El Sol</hi> said a “civil war that could
                            destroy the U.S. may be in the offing. Newark is a warning that cannot
                            go unheeded.” It said “irresponsible” Negro leaders were to blame for
                            the events, naming Stokely Carmichael.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">“Summer Madness Undiagnosed”</hi></p>
                        <p>Radical Liberal <hi rend="italic">Politiken</hi>, Copenhagen, observed
                            that “a diagnosis of the reasons for the summer madness in the big
                            cities of the U.S. would probably be more useful” than exploring the
                            moon. It said that “the world should be careful not to condemn the
                            phenomenon one-sidedly.”</p>
                        <p>In Sweden, liberal <hi rend="italic">Expressen</hi> of Stockholm found
                            the Newark events “not astonishing” considering “how little is being
                            done to eliminate the causes of dissatisfaction.” It contended that
                            “what is astonishing is that the riots have not occurred more often and
                            reached even more destructive scope.”</p>

                        <p>Indian editors deplored the “paradox” of riots in a period of social
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Free Press Journal</hi> of Bombay said:</p>
                        <quote><p>“The claim is perhaps not without justification that no previous
                                American Administration in living memory has done as much for the

                                administration. Yet, paradoxically enough, even as official efforts

                            increased.”</p></quote>
                        <p>The paper said “basic inequality” would continue, “and it will not be
                            surprising, meanwhile, if Negro discontent expresses itself in violent
                            forms, however much this violence may be deplored.”</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Times of India</hi> wrote:</p>

                                Negroes . . . . The general attitude of the police towards Negroes
                                is not helpful.”</p></quote>
                        <p>The conservative London <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> said that,
                            except in housing, “progress in removing discrimination against Negroes
                            has been much faster than ever before on all fronts . . . . Much that
                            could otherwise be done in the way of material improvements has had to
                            be postponed because of the drain of the Vietnam war.”</p>
                        <p>The paper feared that “the growing influence of agitators preaching
                            violence in a campaign for black power” could mean “an excuse for an
                            orgy of looting and anti-white violence.” It urged Administration and
                            community efforts to “remove the underlying causes of discontent, thus
                            supporting the moderate Negro leaders.”</p>

                            the time when Negroes have more chances than ever to find their place in
                            a fairer and more fraternal American society.”</p>
                        <p>The paper said that the “rebellion” was started by Negro extremists of

                            “not intended to accelerate the integration of colored people, but to
                            prevent it.” <persName corresp="#p_CL_1">Carmichael</persName>, the
                            paper declared, refused cooperation with whites and sought

                            <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I want to discuss with you two issues that concern me deeply—the need for
                            change in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> programs, <hi rend="italic">when circumstances so require;</hi> and the need to
                            address ourselves to fundamental problems.</p>
                        <p>Most of us, in varying degrees, resist change. All of us like the
                            familiar and at times face the untried with trepidation. We find it more
                            comfortable to continue in established patterns than to question them.
                            From conversations and previous <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>
                            letters, you know my concern that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            can become too comfortable in familiar routines that may have outlived
                            their usefulness. Media products and activities tend to become ends in
                            themselves rather than means toward ends.</p>
                        <p>The second issue, closely related, is the need to analyze the fundamental
                            problems that face the United States country by country—not simply the
                            superficial manifestations of these problems. We then must <pb n="485" facs="0526" xml:id="pg_485"/>judge how <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, using the tools of modern communications, can
                            contribute toward their solution. Since many of these problems are
                            long-range in nature, so our programs must be geared to long-term needs.
                            Progress may require years, not weeks or months; yet we must set our
                            sights clearly and realistically, shaping programs so that each day’s
                            efforts contribute toward our goals. And as circumstances change, our
                            programs must change with them.</p>
                        <p>In all frankness, I do not believe that today all programs measure up to
                            these standards. We often attack the superficial symptoms, not the
                            fundamental illness. We frequently apply band-aids where the requirement
                            is for penicillin. And at times we continue with old remedies that may
                            no longer be effective.</p>
                        <p>I can think of no profession where such constant re-examination and
                            questioning is more necessary than in <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>To shape meaningful goals and realistic programs, I am sure you will
                            agree, we need a sound understanding of the psychology of the peoples
                            with whom we communicate—their hopes and frustrations, their basic
                            motivations, outlook and attitudes. Each post should cull the best from
                            writings and studies that cast light on these questions, adding to them
                            the expert first-hand knowledge of local employees and American staff.
                            The resulting analysis should serve as a basis for the country program
                            in shaping objectives and in guiding the approaches for media products
                            and activities.</p>
                        <p>I call to your attention the attached analysis of the psychology of Arab
                            peoples, “Arabia Decepta: A People Self-Deluded,” in the July 14 issue
                            of <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">Attached but
                                not printed.</note> I know that you as <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>’s are capable of producing such expert analyses of your
                            own target audiences. I would like to challenge each <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss> who has not written such a document to
                            do so within the next two months.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East, we now face the question, “Where do we go from here?”
                            In several countries, we must start afresh. We are forced to re-think
                            the circumstances under which we shall operate, the fundamental problems
                            we face, what our objectives should be and how we can best achieve
                            them.</p>
                        <p>We need not, however, await an unfortunate debacle such as that in the
                            Middle East in order to take the same searching view of our programs
                            elsewhere. We should take a fresh look, in terms of current
                            circumstances and the foreseeable future, with no necessity to
                            perpetuate operations in their old forms. Where these serve we should
                            continue them; where they do not, we should find new formulas.</p>
                        <p><pb n="486" facs="0527" xml:id="pg_486"/>I am aware that much fine
                            analytical work has gone into the preparation of the <gloss target="#t_CPPM_1">CPPM</gloss>’s; we must build on this but move
                            still further. I have accordingly asked the Area Assistant Directors to
                            review <gloss target="#t_CPPM_1">CPPM</gloss>’s and Country Plans to see
                            whether they contain, in the opening “Situation” section, an analysis
                            along the lines mentioned above; whether objectives are responsible to
                            the fundamental problems as outlined; and whether programs are
                            imaginatively framed to accomplish objectives. I have also asked each to
                            give me an analytical paper dealing with the psychological situation,
                            objectives and programs on an area basis.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this review, some of you will be asked by your Area
                            Assistant Directors to re-think certain aspects of your program before
                            preparing your new <gloss target="#t_CPPM_1">CPPM</gloss> or Country
                            Plan later this year. But for all <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAOs</gloss>,
                            re-examination and revision are continuing processes. I hope that each
                            of you will be challenged by these concepts and will give your best
                            thought to putting them into practice.</p>

                        <p>It has become apparent that the Russians have started a campaign directed
                            against the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, accusing it of
                            attempting to undermine the 50th Anniversary celebration of the founding
                            of the Soviet Union, scheduled for October 1967.</p>
                        <p>There have been a series of articles in <hi rend="italic">Pravda,
                                Izvestiya</hi> and various youth publications which follow a similar

                            were amply predicted; yet when Newark, Detroit and other cities erupted
                            in recent days they left the country shocked and dismayed by their
                            nature and magnitude.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">See <ref target="#d158fn2">footnote 2, Document 158</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>A variety of explanations of the events is being offered. Theories are
                            manifold, and sometimes conflicting. Several Congressional hearings have
                            been scheduled, and from these undoubtedly will emerge a wide range of
                            ideas and proposals.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">Between August 2 and
                                August 30, Senate committees held hearings addressing the riots in

                            associated with racial unrest are likely to remain prominent in the
                            coming weeks. These are major news stories, and <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media must continue to report them
                            in some detail in order to maintain credibility.</p>
                        <p>Guidelines:</p>
                        <p>—Focus sharply on President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s two-pronged response (7/27/67) to the
                            challenge: (1) measures aimed at a quick, final and <pb n="489" facs="0530" xml:id="pg_489"/>permanent end to the violence and
                            punishment of law-breakers, and (2) “an attack—mounted at every
                            level—upon the conditions that breed despair and violence . . .
                            ignorance, discrimination, slums, disease, and not enough jobs.”<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s July 27 “Address to the Nation on Civil

                        <p>—Stress that only a tiny minority of the Negro population has taken part
                            in the violence; that the great majority of Negroes, as well as whites,
                            utterly deplore such tactics.</p>
                        <p>—Call particular attention to the July 26 joint statement by Negro
                            leaders <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">Martin Luther King</persName>,

                            Young, Jr., condemning the criminal violence and those who incite it.
                            They stated: “We who have fought so long and so hard to achieve justice
                            for all Americans have consistently opposed violence as a means of
                            redress. Riots have proved ineffective, disruptive and highly damaging
                            to the Negro population, to the civil rights cause, and to the entire
                                nation.”<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">For full text of the statement,
                                see “Top Negro Leaders Call for an End to Rioting,” <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, July 27, 1967, p.
                            A1.</note></p>
                        <p>—To the extent possible, place the urban violence in socio-economic
                            perspective. Rapid industrialization in the South, especially in
                            agriculture where mechanization displaced human labor in recent years,
                            as well as other factors, resulted in mass migrations to the cities.
                            Cities were not prepared to cope with the massive influxes, and
                            overcrowding, inadequate housing and schooling, and unemployment
                            followed. Most Negroes from rural areas lacked technical skills, and
                            were thus unemployable until trained. All these complex problems are
                            being tackled, but by their nature are solvable only over the long
                            term.</p>
                        <p>—While the U.S. as a whole has been enjoying unprecedented affluence,
                            there has remained a hard core of disadvantaged persons who, for lack of
                            education or the technical skills required by a modern nation, have not
                            benefited. Results of the War on Poverty and a variety of other Great
                            Society programs, such as massive Federal aid to education, will be felt
                            in time.</p>
                        <p>—While these long-range programs are gaining momentum—and many will take
                            years to produce large-scale results—a number of intermediate measures
                            are also in progress—by municipalities, volunteer groups, states, and
                            the Federal Government. The Federal Government’s Office of Economic
                            Opportunity directs such diverse programs as Job Corps, Head Start,
                            Neighborhood Youth Corps, Upward Bound, and others.</p>
                        <p><pb n="490" facs="0531" xml:id="pg_490"/>—Many of these programs have
                            stirred interest and hope among the underprivileged where previously
                            there had been only passivity and despair. Thus, paradoxically, the
                            improvement in the Negroes’ condition in recent years has contributed to
                            the bringing about of violence, in the opinion of some observers.
                            “Nothing is so unstable as a bad situation that is beginning to
                            improve,” writes William V. Shannon (New York Times, 7/27/67).<note n="6" xml:id="d161fn6">For full text of Shannon’s commentary, see
                                William V. Shannon, “Negro Violence vs. the American Dream,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, July 27, 1967, p. 34.</note>
                            Sociologists point out that progress in its initial stages tends to
                            generate expectations faster than they can be fulfilled; people who
                            harbor frustrated hopes are more likely to rebel than those with no hope
                            at all.</p>
                        <p>When violence takes over, obviously the story of quiet, steady progress
                            of the Negro American cannot command comparable attention. But we must
                            continue to plug away at that story, as we have over the years. That it
                            has produced results is evident in the generally sympathetic and
                            knowledgeable way many foreign editors have been handling the story of
                            the Negro American and the current situation. The progress has been
                            dramatic in civil rights legislation, voter registration and other
                            political gains, economic benefits deriving from various Great Society
                            and other programs.</p>
                        <p>You should screen the Negro press in the U.S. for constructive editorial
                            comment which will make clear that most of America’s 20 million Negroes
                            are opposed to extremism and law-breaking, that the vast majority seek
                            ways of working with their white fellow-Americans toward racial and
                            economic equality.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cautions:</p>
                        <p>Only to the minimum extent consistent with credibility should you report
                            extreme, partisan statements seeking to place blame for the violence on
                            one political group or another. On the other hand, statements which
                            demonstrate widespread recognition of the need to do more for the
                            underprivileged are useful.</p>
                        <p>Do not espouse any one theory, or any “pat” interpretation, of the cause
                            or causes of the urban unrest. Many of the so-called experts are baffled
                            by seeming inconsistencies and conflicting facts.</p>
                        <p>Avoid such inflammatory reports as those describing the situation as “a
                            conspiracy,” “civil war,” “revolution,” etc.</p>

                        <p>The riots in Newark, Detroit, and half a dozen other cities have drawn
                            increasingly sensational headlines and heavy coverage in most news
                            centers around the world.</p>
                        <p>As the riots in Detroit rose to a new level of violence, newspapers
                            abroad generally raised the pitch of their headlines from “riots” to
                            “rebellion” or, in some extreme cases, to “revolution” and even “civil
                            war.”</p>

                            non-Communist world has reflected great concern but also sympathetic
                            understanding of the complexities. The primary lines of thought
                            emphasized most frequently were:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. U.S. race relations are very serious and dangerous. Any
                                one-sided condemnation would be wrong because they are also very

                            <p>2. The tragic situation is “paradoxical” and “ironic” because the

                                the welfare of the Negroes.</p>
                            <p>3. But much more progress is needed to give the Negroes equality.
                                What has been done is “like sprinkling water on thirsty soil.”</p>
                            <p>4. Therefore, the Negro extremists are, “unfortunately,” taking over
                                from the moderates.</p>
                            <p>5. Extremists such as Stokely Carmichael<note n="8" xml:id="d161fn8">See <ref target="#d158fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    158</ref>.</note> believe that the force of riots is necessary
                                to stimulate faster progress for the impatient Negroes. This is not
                                surprising and they may be right.</p></quote>
                        <p>Less conspicuous has been the view expressed in some commentaries that
                            the riots have little or nothing to do with the civil rights movement
                            but are created by lawless, hooligan elements that exist in every city
                            ready to destroy and loot whenever possible.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am delighted to be able to respond in detail to your letter of July 12
                            regarding the distribution of our English-language publications in
                            non-English-speaking countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">In his
                                letter to <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName> commented: “In recent
                                months other publications in English, supporting the
                                administration’s position in Vietnam, have come to my attention.
                                These are not marked as to source but I understand that they were
                                published by your agency. I am unable to see the justification for
                                publication and distribution of booklets of this nature in
                                non-English speaking nations.” He requested that <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> “provide the [Senate
                                Committee on Foreign Relations] with the reasons for distributing
                                such publications in non-English speaking countries.” (Ibid.)</note>
                            We maintain a continuing review of requests from all of our <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts for printed media materials in
                            all languages.</p>
                        <p>Basic to the question of distribution of pamphlets in English is the
                            number of people around the world who have an English-speaking
                            capability. At present, they total almost a half-billion persons.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the world, 285 million people speak English as their first
                            language making it second only to Chinese among the world’s living
                            languages. At least 200 million more people use English as an acquired
                            idiom. It is our only international language, with one-sixth of the
                            world’s population having a working knowledge of it.</p>
                        <p>Its importance to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> cannot be
                            underestimated in terms of its universality in reaching world opinion
                            leaders. Although the Agency’s pamphlet program emphasizes production in
                            languages native to recipients worldwide, there is a continuing need at
                            all <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts for modest quantities
                            of pamphlets in English. Eighteen of these countries, with a total
                            population of nearly 95 million people, use English as an official or
                            co-official language. These figures include eight countries in Africa,
                            five in East Asia and the Pacific, one in Europe, two in Latin America,
                            one in the Near East, plus Canada. Thus, the importance of English in
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s efforts in international
                            communication cannot be overemphasized.</p>
                        <p>The pamphlet you enclosed with your letter—“Viet Cong Use of Terror
                            Against the Vietnamese People”—was produced by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> in Saigon for distribution in
                            limited copies in English to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            posts <pb n="493" facs="0534" xml:id="pg_493"/>requesting copies. Sample
                            copies were sent by <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts worldwide with a mimeographed
                            order form containing a coupon to be returned to Saigon indicating
                            number of copies requested. To date, 17 posts have responded and orders
                            totaling 10,924 copies have been shipped. Of these orders, 7,300 were
                            from countries where English either is the official or co-official
                            language. The remaining 3,624 pamphlets were sent to
                            non-English-speaking countries. The largest order—3,600—came from
                            Canberra. Kuala Lumpur, where English is a co-official language, was
                            second with an order for 2,000 copies. The remaining 15 orders were for
                            comparatively small quantities.</p>
                        <p>Both the Agency and <gloss target="#t_JUSPAO_1">JUSPAO</gloss> usually
                            print a small number of pamphlets in English and send sample copies to
                            all principal <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts with an offer
                            to fill reasonable requests for additional copies. Non-English-speaking
                            posts generally respond with requests for small numbers of pamphlets in
                            English for distribution to the following groups: government officials,
                            professors and students, editors and publishers, business leaders, and
                            similar opinion leaders whose sophistication includes a knowledge of
                            English. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>
                            students and teachers who have studied in America are always eager to
                            receive publications in English, as are members of the foreign
                            diplomatic corps, many of whom are fluent in English. <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Libraries, Information Centers,
                            Cultural Centers and Binational Centers all maintain English reading
                            rooms frequented by scholars and students where these pamphlets are
                            available for the asking.</p>
                        <p>Distribution of English-language pamphlets in Viet-Nam seldom exceeds
                            10,000 copies of any one of them. Approximately 7,000 copies are
                            distributed to our Abraham Lincoln Library in Saigon and to the three
                            other American Cultural Centers in Dalat, Can Tho and Da Nang. In each
                            of these centers, there is a continuing demand for pamphlets in English
                            since monthly attendance averages 18,000 patrons. Additional pamphlets
                            are made available to the six Vietnamese-American Associations in
                            Saigon/Cholon, Can Tho, Nha Trang, Dalat and Da Nang which conduct
                            English-teaching programs with a total enrollment of 14,000 students.
                            The other 3,000 pamphlets are sent to the Mission Press Center for
                            distribution to more than 500 foreign correspondents, to diplomatic
                            missions, to all official visitors, and to Vietnamese who have asked to
                            receive these publications on a continuing basis. In some instances, as
                            in the case of a pamphlet explaining USAID’s activities (“The View
                            Beyond the Battle”), these publications are used by USAID and <gloss target="#t_MACV_1">MACV</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CORDS_1">CORDS</gloss> for briefing visitors to Viet-Nam and copies are made
                            available to them for permanent reference.</p>
                        <p>As you requested, a copy of each of the Agency’s English-language
                            pamphlets on Viet-Nam produced in Washington and Saigon is <pb n="494" facs="0535" xml:id="pg_494"/>enclosed.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">Not found.</note> Each pamphlet contains an insert showing

                        <p>(1) QUESTION: Why has the United States always supported Israel against
                            the Arab states?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: It has never been U.S. policy to support Israel against the Arab
                            states. Like the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and a majority of the
                            members of the United Nations, the U.S. favored the establishment of
                            Israel as a state in 1948.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">For further

                        <p>But the U.S. certainly did not support the Israeli use of force against
                            Egypt in 1956.<note n="3" xml:id="d163fn3">Reference is to the Suez

                        <p>ANSWER: In this crisis, as before, the U.S. has opposed acts of hostility
                            and acts likely to lead to war—the infiltration of terrorists, the
                            closing of the Strait of Tiran, the menace of mobilization, the
                            encouragement and support of an arms race in the area.<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">On May 22, President <persName corresp="#p_NGA_1">Nasser</persName> announced that Israeli vessels would not be

                            everything in its power to find a peaceful solution to the crisis before
                            fighting broke out. It used its influence with all involved in an effort
                            to prevent the outbreak of fighting.</p>
                        <p>When the fighting started, the U.S. made every effort to obtain a
                            cease-fire, and then to move toward a more durable peace. That course is
                            in the equal interest of the Arab states as well as Israel.</p>
                        <p>(3) QUESTION: What about the widespread reports that American and British
                            warplanes helped the Israelis in the fighting?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In the first hours of the war, the Israelis destroyed most of the
                            Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian Air Forces. Arab leaders, particularly in
                            Cairo, were unwilling or unable to admit this great loss. So the story
                            of U.S. intervention was invented as an excuse.</p>
                        <p>Jordanian leaders have admitted there was no evidence of foreign
                            intervention, and other Arab leaders are gradually coming around to
                            making the same admission.</p>
                        <p>It is noteworthy that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>,

                        <p>(4) QUESTION: What about the USS Liberty,<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">Reference is to the June 8 attack on the USS <hi rend="italic">Liberty</hi> by Israeli boats and planes. For additional

                            photographs? Didn’t the U.S. use its highly sophisticated scientific and
                            electronic equipment to spy for Israel, and to disrupt Arab military
                            communications?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: These stories grew out of the first tales of intervention by U.S.
                            aircraft. They are equally untrue.</p>
                        <p>As for the USS Liberty, it seems likely that if the Liberty had been
                            helping the Israelis, the latter would have been aware of its presence
                            and would not have attacked it.</p>
                        <p>There were no U–2s involved. There was no U.S. jamming of communications.

                        <p>(5) QUESTION: Even if there was no direct U.S. military intervention,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> did help
                            Israel. He urged President <persName corresp="#p_NGA_1">Nasser</persName> not to start the fighting. Then the Israelis
                            struck first. Wasn’t this an American-Israeli plot?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The United States, both publicly and privately, urged <hi rend="italic">all</hi> parties to keep from starting hostilities. As
                            to who actually fired the first shot, we have only the claims of the two
                            sides. Each says the other started it.</p>
                        <p>The staff of the U.N. Emergency Force, as impartial observers, might have
                            been able to determine who was the aggressor. But the U.N.E.F. had been
                            removed from the border at Egyptian request.</p>
                        <p>(6) QUESTION: You will admit, though, that the United States gave Israel
                            large amounts of military equipment—especially in the period just before
                            the fighting started—and encouraged Israeli aggression in that way?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In the past few years, seventy-five per cent of all arms flowing
                            into the Middle East have come from the Soviet Union. The United States
                            and Europe have each supplied about one-eighth of the region’s
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>Soviet arms, worth over $2,000 million, have gone entirely to Arab
                            states. U.S. and West European arms went to <hi rend="italic">both</hi>
                            Israel and the Arab states.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has always urged a limitation on arms shipments to the Middle
                            East, and has provided arms only to prevent an imbalance in military
                            capabilities. Over half of U.S. weaponry in the Middle East has gone to
                            Arab states.</p>
                        <p>There were, incidentally, no significant U.S. shipments to Israel just
                            before the outbreak of hostilities. In fact, the bulk of U.S. arms sold
                            to Israel has been surplus World War II equipment.</p>
                        <p>(7) QUESTION: What about economic assistance to Israel?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. has provided economic assistance totalling over $1
                            billion to Israel. In recent years the level of assistance has declined
                            as the Israeli economy grew stronger.</p>
                        <p>During the same period the U.S. provided economic aid to Arab states as
                            well. For example, our economic aid to the U.A.R.—over $1.1 billion—was
                            greater than to Israel. Other Arab states: Algeria $202 million, Iraq
                            $59 million, Jordan $562 million, Libya $208 million, <pb n="497" facs="0538" xml:id="pg_497"/>Morocco $591 million, Lebanon $103
                            million, Saudi Arabia $47 million, Sudan $127 million, Syria $80
                            million, Tunisia $516 million, Yemen $43 million. These figures
                            emphatically refute a notion of partiality in giving aid.</p>
                        <p>(8) QUESTION: The U.S. may be able to deny its military and economic
                            collaboration with Israel, but there is no disguising U.S. championship
                            of Israel in the U.N. Why has the U.S. led the effort to defeat U.N.
                            resolutions demanding immediate Israel withdrawal from the territory
                            Israel has gained by its aggression?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. believes that withdrawal of Israeli forces is an
                            essential element in any Middle Eastern settlement. But, as a practical
                            matter, such withdrawal can hardly be expected in the absence of
                            arrangements which would assure a more stable situation in the area than
                            existed before June 5, 1967. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goldberg</persName>, chief U.S. representative at the U.N., spoke
                            of what the situation would be if such an unconditional withdrawal took
                            place:</p>
                        <quote><p>“Once again opposing forces would stand in direct confrontation,
                                poised for combat. Once again, no international machinery would be
                                present to hold them apart. Once again, innocent maritime passage
                                would be denied. Once again there would be no bar to belligerent
                                acts and acts of force. Once again there would be no acceptance of
                                Israel by her neighbors as a sovereign state, no action to solve the
                                tragic refugee problem, no effective security against terrorism and
                                violence.</p>

                        <p>(9) QUESTION: What about the much-proclaimed U.S. policy of guaranteeing
                            the territorial integrity of all nations in the Middle East? Or does
                            that guarantee really only apply to Israel?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: It applies to all nations in the Middle East. But territorial
                            integrity is best guaranteed by a genuine peace. The U.S. hopes there
                            will be found the basis for a just and durable peace in the Middle East.
                            That can only be a peace which rests on respect for the territorial
                            integrity and political independence of all the states in the area,
                            justice for the refugees, a status for Jerusalem which protects the deep
                            religious interests of the whole world, the assurance of maritime
                            rights, and an end of the arms race in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>(10) QUESTION: How can you expect the Arab states to recognize
                            Israel?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The fact is that Israel does exist. It would be extremely
                            difficult for the Arab states to assume normal diplomatic relations in
                                <pb n="498" facs="0539" xml:id="pg_498"/>the light of all that has
                            happened. But a start must be made, and it can best be made at the root
                            of the problem. That is the claim of some Arab states that a state of
                            war continues with Israel, and that they have the right to the status of
                            belligerents under international law with respect to Israel.</p>
                        <p>The claim of belligerent rights works both ways. If Egypt claims
                            belligerent rights, it can hardly deny belligerent rights to Israel.
                            Egypt cannot claim the right to mass overwhelming military forces on
                            Israel’s borders, issue threats of liquidation, exclude Israel from the
                            Suez Canal, blockade the Gulf of Aqaba—and then deny Israel the right of
                            countermeasures. Surely, the time has come to see if better ways to
                            resolve these differences can be found.</p>
                        <p>(11) QUESTION: How can you urge the Arab states to recognize Israel when
                            you refuse to recognize the People’s Republic of China?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The two cases are not the same. Israel’s existence has been
                            recognized by the United Nations from the first. With Communist China,
                            it has been quite another case. The regime has been branded an aggressor
                            by the United Nations for its part in the Korean war. Communist China
                            has shown little inclination to change its bellicose ways since then.
                            And Peking outspokenly defies and denounces the U.N.</p>
                        <p>(12) QUESTION: Isn’t it true that Jewish voters in the United States
                            dictate American policy toward the Middle East?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: There is no doubt that many Jewish Americans have an interest in
                            the welfare of Israel. And, like any other interest group, they try to
                            see that U.S. Government policy takes their views into account. For that
                            matter, so do the large oil companies which have investments in Arab
                            states. But American foreign policy represents a national consensus, not
                            just the wishes of a single interest group.</p>
                        <p>(13) QUESTION: Isn’t the United States trying to keep the Middle East in
                            a state of neocolonialism? Isn’t it U.S. policy to retard Arabs’
                            progress for the sake of U.S. business interests, especially oil
                            interests?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: It doesn’t seem reasonable that the United States would spend
                            over $3 billion in economic aid to the Arab nations if it wanted to keep
                            them in an underdeveloped condition.</p>
                        <p>As for American business interests, it would be more profitable for them
                            if the Middle East progressed more rapidly. American business invests
                            more money, and earns greater profits, in developed areas. For example,
                            the U.S. business investment in Europe now runs to over $13.5 billion.
                            The American investment in the Middle East, oil and all, is slightly
                            over $1 billion.</p>
                        <p>(14) QUESTION: If that is so, then why does the United States always
                            support feudal and reactionary Arab states against the progressive
                            ones?</p>
                        <p><pb n="499" facs="0540" xml:id="pg_499"/>ANSWER: First, the United States
                            cannot dictate the system of government for any other state.</p>
                        <p>Second, some of the so-called progressive Arab states have allowed
                            doctrinaire, and often out-dated, political theory to obstruct
                            development of fruitful relations with the United States. When these
                            artificial barriers have not been raised by the Arab states themselves,
                            the U.S. has always been willing to enter into a mutually beneficial
                            relationship. U.S. economic assistance to the area shows this. So do
                            U.S. commercial relations. Proceeds from the sale of oil can be the
                            basis of economic development—as is the case in Kuwait, for example.</p>
                        <p>(15) QUESTION: Actually, isn’t the U.S. merely using the Arab states as
                            pawns in the “cold war”?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: One of the eventualities the United States hoped to avoid was the
                            splitting of the Middle East into two camps, along East-West lines. For
                            one thing, the big powers cannot decide the dispute between Israel and
                            the Arab states. Both President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN_1">Kosygin</persName> have stated this clearly.</p>
                        <p>For another, when the nations of the Middle East look to the big powers
                            for war materials and political backing in their military adventures,
                            they are merely putting off the time when a peaceful settlement must be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the intrusion of big-power considerations into regional disputes
                            can seriously jeopardize world peace.</p>
                        <p>(16) QUESTION: Nonetheless, the United States is a big power, and does
                            have responsibilities in the Middle East. How does the U.S. propose to
                            carry out those responsibilities?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: If you mean that the big powers have a special responsibility to
                            see the peace is preserved, then the United States is carrying out its
                            responsibilities in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>The United States has consistently supported the kind of peace settlement
                            to which both sides could find it possible to subscribe. This program
                            has been listed in many ways. Perhaps these ten points cover it as well
                            as any:</p>

                        <p><pb n="500" facs="0541" xml:id="pg_500"/>(17) QUESTION: When the U.S.
                            advocates limitations on arms, it really wants to keep the Arab states
                            in a permanent condition of military inferiority to Israel—isn’t that
                            right?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The basic position of the United States is that arms and arms
                            races have no place in the settlement of Middle East problems. The U.S.
                            hopes that the major suppliers of arms could cooperate in a program of
                            arms limitation, and public registration of arms shipments, which would
                            permit the allocation of scarce resources now spent on arms to the vital
                            requirements of technological and economic development of the area.</p>
                        <p>Then there is also the danger that Arab leaders will find they have
                            bargained away a sizable part of their independence in exchange for
                            Soviet arms.</p>
                        <p>(18) QUESTION: What about the Arab refugees from Palestine?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>
                            proposed that the refugees have a free and private choice of their
                            future. The U.S. is firmly opposed to permanent eviction of the
                            refugees, and to barring their return.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that not all would want to return to the Palestine
                            area—especially if they were offered an opportunity for resettlement,
                            with the required financial backing, in other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>It should be remembered that the United States has contributed over a
                            third of a billion dollars to Palestinian refugee relief since 1950.
                            This is about 70 per cent of the total funds made available for this
                            purpose. So it cannot be said that the U.S. is not interested in the
                            welfare of the refugees, or in a permanent solution of their
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>(19) QUESTION: The U.S. didn’t vote for condemnation of the Israeli
                            annexation of Jerusalem by the U.N. General Assembly. Does this mean the
                            U.S. concurs in the Israeli annexation?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The United States has made it clear that the U.S. will not accept
                            Israel’s unilateral action as a determinant of the future of
                                Jerusalem.<note n="8" xml:id="d163fn8">See Robert Young, “U.S.

                        <p>The Israeli Government has said that its arrangements for the
                            administration of Jerusalem were not an annexation. It seemed to the
                            United States that the proposed U.N.G.A. resolution, which condemned
                            annexation and called for its recision, was not directed to the
                            situation on the ground.<note n="9" xml:id="d163fn9">For further

                        <p>(20) QUESTION: How do you feel about what happened in the June–July 1967
                            emergency session of the U.N. General Assembly, then?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. didn’t seek the emergency session. The U.S. didn’t think
                            that the U.N. Security Council had exhausted all its possibilities for
                            action in the Middle East crisis. It seemed doubtful the General
                            Assembly could make a helpful contribution. Once the session was called,
                            however, the U.S. sought to encourage resolutions which had a realistic
                            prospect of helping to bring lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>The General Assembly, in its capacity as a “town meeting” of the world,
                            did crystallize a certain state of world opinion. The General Assembly
                            refused to name a single aggressor. In effect, it expressed opposition
                            to territorial change achieved by force. It demonstrated the strong
                            international interest in the holy places of Jerusalem. The General
                            Assembly couldn’t agree on the way peace should be achieved—but it did
                            indicate that peace was a more desirable goal than the mere return to
                            the armistice situation.</p>
                        <p>On balance, the emergency session was not the failure some see it to
                            be.</p>
                        <p>(21) QUESTION: The United States has never been more unpopular in the
                            Middle East. What are you going to do about it?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. doesn’t consider popularity per se as its most important
                            goal in the Middle East. Naturally the people of the United States
                            resent the false allegations that the U.S. was in collusion with Israel
                            during the hostilities. The U.S. regrets the decision of some Arab
                            countries to break off relations on the basis of these charges. These
                            factors necessarily influence American attitudes toward the states
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. hopes that the adverse effects will be redressed quickly, so
                            that normal relations may be re-established. Boycotts and other forms of
                            retaliation are only self-defeating.</p>
                        <p>What is needed is the realization throughout the Middle East that peace
                            and regional economic cooperation are vital to the area now.</p>
                        <p><pb n="502" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_502"/>(22) QUESTION: Will the U.S. be
                            willing to supply economic aid to the Middle East again?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. interest in economic development of the region, and of
                            all the states in it, has not been affected by what has happened in the
                            1967 crisis. The U.S. will not be vindictive in its approach to those
                            who have broken relations, nor will the U.S. engage in any
                            reprisals.</p>
                        <p>The American hope is that conditions of amity and security may soon
                            enable the U.S. to resume the types of peaceful, constructive assistance
                            it has rendered in the past. The U.S. would join with others in
                            international programs of regional development for the Middle East as
                            soon as political conditions permit such efforts.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>During the past several months, I have given considerable attention to
                            the recommendations in the Twenty-second Report of the United States
                            Advisory Commission on Information.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">Reference is to <hi rend="italic">The Twenty-Second Report of the
                                    United States Advisory Commission on Information to the Congress
                                    of the United States</hi>, January 26, 1967.</note> Each of the
                            recommendations made by the Commission has been studied in detail by the
                            sections affected and reviewed by me.</p>
                        <p>At the outset, I want the Commission to know that I am heartened by your
                            praise of our efforts and gratified at your recognition of the need for
                            an expansion of the existing program service. I want to assure you that
                            we are aware of the importance of our mission and the heavy
                            responsibility which we bear in attempting to relate American domestic
                            and foreign policy to overseas audiences.</p>
                        <p>Now, I would like to offer the following comments on the specific points
                            made by your Commission:</p>
                        <p><pb n="503" facs="0544" xml:id="pg_503"/>1. You recommend the appointment
                            of a permanent Deputy Director chosen from within the career Civil
                            Service or Foreign Service to provide a continuity of management as
                            high-level personnel change periodically.</p>
                        <p>In 1964 Congress provided for two Deputy Directors—one appointed by the
                            President and the other a career officer. These are permanent positions
                            and have been filled by the type of individual which you describe.</p>
                        <p>From the time the legislation was passed in 1964 to date, there have been
                            only two Deputy Directors—one held the position for four and one-half
                            years and the present incumbent for two years.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">Presumably a reference to <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Donald Wilson</persName>, who was Deputy
                                Director from 1961 to 1965, and to <persName corresp="#p_ARW_1">Robert Akers</persName>, who was the Deputy Director at the
                                time.</note></p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Deputy for Policy and Plans has always been a career
                            officer and incumbents have held the position for substantial periods of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that these two positions meet your objectives.
                            Accordingly, I do not share your view that there should be any
                            additional officer assigned for management responsibility.</p>
                        <p>2. You also refer to the past practice of assigning Foreign Service
                            Officers to geographic areas with which they have limited knowledge.
                            During my term of office, I have attempted to build up a corps who would
                            specialize in particular areas such as you describe—an Arabic corps, a
                            Slavik corps, an African corps, an Asian corps, a European corps, a
                            Latin American corps. Wherever possible we are now assigning officers to
                            those areas in which they have developed a particular expertise and
                            where their language aptitudes can be used profitably. Because of the
                            need for rotation of officers and transfer to the United States at
                            periodic intervals, it is not always possible to assign personnel to
                            areas in which they have developed particular expertise. Nevertheless, I
                            agree with your concept, support your objectives and am attempting to
                            fulfill them.</p>
                        <p>3. You recommend the production of information materials tailored to fit
                            local needs. This is a concept with which I thoroughly agree. We strive
                            to meet this requirement and have made great progress in this
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>Currently, we are publishing 66 magazines for specific countries. For
                            example, in India <hi rend="italic">Span</hi> has a circulation of
                            approximately 100,000 and the <hi rend="italic">American Reporter</hi>
                            has a circulation of 400,000 solely within that country. We also produce
                                <hi rend="italic">American Review</hi> directed to the Indian
                            cultural and intellectual community. Similarly in Russia, we publish <hi rend="italic">America</hi> Magazine directed to the Russian
                            audience, and another edition <pb n="504" facs="0545" xml:id="pg_504"/>of that publication for the Polish audience. Our activities in other
                            countries are directed along the same lines; the effort to meet local
                            needs will be continued.</p>
                        <p>4. I share your enthusiasm for our program of English Teaching. Last
                            year, about 300,000 persons studied English through <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>-sponsored programs. In addition, a
                            large audience had the opportunity to study the English language through
                            radio programs broadcast by the Voice of America or over local stations
                            through <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>-supplied tapes. Three
                            series of television programs, “Let’s Learn English,” “Let’s Speak
                            English,” and “Adventures in English” have been distributed in 63
                            countries. It is my objective to emphasize this aspect of our activity
                            in all under-developed areas of the world.</p>
                        <p>5. Similarly, I share your enthusiasm for recruiting and training Women’s
                            Affairs Officers to serve in countries where women’s groups are actively
                            participating in society or in emerging societies where this trend is
                            now evident. We have under consideration at this time the addition of a
                            Women’s Affairs Officer in several countries.</p>
                        <p>6. I note you suggest that we consider a publication which would “deal
                            with democracy, modernization and nation building” as a companion
                            publication to <hi rend="italic">Problems of Communism</hi> which you
                            commend so highly.</p>
                        <p>It is my view that these subjects are treated constantly in various
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> publications and that a
                            single publication devoted to these subjects would not be as effective
                            as the placement of specific articles in many publications which would
                            reach a much larger audience. A specialized publication would have a
                            very restricted appeal and could only reach a limited audience. You can
                            see that our present system enables us to reach many more people with
                            significant information on these vital topics.</p>
                        <p>7. You point out the necessity of providing opinion-forming groups with
                            information on the free labor movement in the United States and on the
                            progress of free labor organizations around the world. I support this
                            objective.</p>
                        <p>We have at present a full-time Labor Information Officer in the Office of
                            Policy, and similar officers in our posts in Japan, Argentina, Brazil,
                            Bolivia, Bogota, Montevideo and Caracas. I have stressed the importance
                            of disseminating labor information and the need for highly-trained
                            officers to carry out the mission. Currently, I am in the process of
                            recruiting an additional Labor Information Officer and will seek others
                            as opportunities arise and our budget permits.</p>
                        <p>8. I share your enthusiasm for the work being carried on by the
                            Binational Centers, particularly in Latin America as referred to by
                            Ambassador Charles W. Cole in his report to me from which you
                                quote.<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">Not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                        <p><pb n="505" facs="0546" xml:id="pg_505"/>To encourage the development of
                            these institutions, last year I authorized the expenditure of $332,000
                            to assist in the improvement of physical facilities in seven countries.
                            This year I have requested an authorization of $1 million for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>To assist in the recruitment of qualified persons as directors of these
                            centers, I am converting these positions from contract status to that of
                            regular employees. I believe that this action will attract more able
                            young people and will keep in our service those who have recently been
                            recruited and who have performed so admirably.</p>
                        <p>9. You comment on our libraries and recommend that the percentage of
                            books in the language of the host country be at least 50% and preferably
                            75%. It has not been possible in the past to reach this level but we are
                            currently adding to our library shelves more books in the languages of
                            the country. Progress is slow since there are not enough suitable books
                            available in translation. For the most part we are dependent upon the
                            translations we sponsor ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I have recently created a committee of distinguished scholars
                            to recommend 250 or more titles of “Great American Classics” so that all
                            of our libraries and reading rooms may have this basic collection. I am
                            confident that it will prove of great value throughout the world and
                            will lift the level of reading material for those scholars who are
                            seeking a wider knowledge of American history, social and political
                            science, culture, drama and scientific accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>During the past year we have also completed a program of displaying
                            classic American art in all of our libraries through the use of high
                            quality lithographs. At this date, approximately 100 libraries in 76
                            countries have participated in the program.</p>
                        <p>10. I note your comments about the need for a vigorous information
                            program in Western Europe and for an expansion of our European programs
                            for youth which should be centered around libraries.</p>
                        <p>I have previously reported to your Commission my desire to expand our
                            information effort in Western Europe. In a recent appearance before the
                            Senate Appropriations Committee, I placed these views in the <hi rend="italic">Record</hi> and testified to the need. In our budget
                            request for Fiscal 1969 an expansion of this program will be sought.</p>
                        <p>11. You advocate the installation of equipment which would become “a
                            corporate memory.” A program of this nature has been started and a
                            computer has been installed for our administrative records. We plan on
                            an expansion of this computer service to include substantive material
                            such as you describe.</p>
                        <p>12. I concur in your suggestion that our training program is basic to the
                            Agency’s operations. You note that I have appointed a new Director of
                            Training and have given him full support for a drastic <pb n="506" facs="0547" xml:id="pg_506"/>revision in this effort.<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">Presumably a reference to <persName corresp="#p_HJJ_1">James J. Halsema</persName>, who was
                                appointed Chief of the Training Division of the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Office of Personal and Training
                                in September 1966.</note> Although insufficient time has elapsed to
                            note the full effect of such changes, I am heartened by the progress
                            which has been made.</p>
                        <p>13. You recommend that the Agency “renew its contacts with the academic
                            community, rekindle its interest and invite its suggestions, reviews and
                            commentaries.” I subscribe to this philosophy and have constantly
                            endeavored to achieve this result.</p>
                        <p>14. You suggest that the inspection program be broadened to include
                            civilian review of Agency operations. Towards this end, I have appointed
                            prominent private individuals as Public Members of inspection teams.
                            Between now and the end of the year, five additional Public Members will
                            be assigned to inspection teams. We have received numerous benefits from
                            such individual appraisals. The program will be expanded as conditions
                            permit.</p>
                        <p>15. You suggest a formulation of a ten-year program culminating in the
                            celebration of the American Bicentennial in 1976. I have not yet done so
                            because of more urgent and immediate problems. Hopefully, I can give
                            serious consideration to this suggestion next year.</p>
                        <p>The above comments on the principal suggestions made in the chapters of
                            your report entitled, “<hi rend="italic">Recommendations for Action by
                                the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>In addition, you propose to Congress that legislation be adopted for a
                            career service for the U.S. Information Agency. I continue to advocate
                            such legislation and am currently awaiting hearings on
                            Administration-sponsored legislation for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you also suggest that Public Law 402 be amended so that the
                            “American taxpayer should no longer be prohibited from seeing and
                            studying the product a government agency produces with public funds for
                            overseas audiences.” I have testified before congressional committees
                            that:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. I have no objection to making any of our products available for
                                inspection. We have nothing to hide and are indeed proud of our
                                efforts.</p>
                            <p>2. However, I do not wish to take the initiative in requesting any
                                funds for the dissemination to <hi rend="italic">United States
                                    citizens</hi> of books, pamphlets, films or radio broadcasts
                                prepared under our auspices. If Congress should authorize such, we
                                shall gladly cooperate.</p></quote>
                        <p>In the concluding portion of your report you recommend to Congress and
                            the President that additional funds be allocated for future Agency
                            operations. I concur and as previously stated will request such in our
                            submission to the Bureau of the Budget for Fiscal 1969.</p>
                        <p><pb n="507" facs="0548" xml:id="pg_507"/>These comments are designed to

                            past two months cannot be recited in any catalogue of events.</p>
                        <p>The Agency performed its functions in operating the Voice of America in
                            38 languages, in producing approximately 80 separate magazines monthly,

                        <p>BIWEEKLY REPORT</p>
                        <p>In my recent visits to overseas posts I regularly inquire about the
                            content of textbooks in secondary schools. My particular concern rises
                            from the manner in which they describe the United States, its
                            government, its political institutions and its culture.</p>
                        <p><pb n="512" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_512"/>From my observations, it
                            appeared that the textbooks of many countries contained misinformation
                            or inadequate information which was being given to children at very
                            impressionable ages. As a result, misconceptions and prejudices were
                            being developed which are difficult to eradicate.</p>
                        <p>To confirm this view, I recently conducted a survey in all areas of the
                            world and found that preliminary impressions were accurate and that in
                            some countries the teachers had a prejudice against American cultural or
                            political institutions which resulted in a serious bias being
                            disseminated to the student bodies.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">Not
                                further identified.</note> In only a few countries did we find that
                            the textbooks devoted adequate attention to the United States and its
                            role in world affairs.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this survey, I have proposed a cooperative program with
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, the Peace Corps and other
                            agencies which play a role in overseas education to enable us to:</p>
                        <quote><p>1. Assist school authorities in foreign countries in the
                                preparation of textbooks relating to the geography, history,

                                United States.</p>
                            <p>2. Provide grants through public or private foundations to local

                                are germane to these topics.</p>

                            <p>5. Hold seminars on American studies for significant groups of
                                secondary school teachers.</p></quote>
                        <p>In addition to these steps, I propose to stress the greater use of our
                            “Ladder Edition” books which are simplified English versions of American
                            books for foreigners who have a limited vocabulary in English. These
                            books are reduced in vocabulary to 1,000 to 5,000 words, simplified in
                            structure to permit rapid reading and appreciation to hold the attention
                            of people to whom English is a second language.</p>
                        <p>The “Ladder” series encompasses a wide selection of program themes
                            ranging from communism and international relations to nation-building,
                            the American social and cultural activities and significant
                            literature.</p>
                        <p>The series is now being sold throughout the world except in
                            English-speaking countries. Currently, approximately 30 new titles are
                            published each year in editions of 20–30,000 copies. The books sell for
                            15ȼ retail but many copies are distributed free of charge. To date, 192
                            titles have been published and approximately 4 million copies have <pb n="513" facs="0554" xml:id="pg_513"/>been sold. For your reference,
                            I am attaching “Building a New Country” which was reduced to a

                        <p>The future of Radio Free Europe has been under consideration for several
                            years. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> convened a
                            special study group in 1966 which consisted of Professor <persName corresp="#p_BZ_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_GWE_1">William Griffith</persName> of <gloss target="#t_MIT_1">MIT</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SRS_1">Richard
                                Salant</persName> of <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss>, and the
                            current Ambassador to Switzerland, <persName corresp="#p_HJS_1">John S.
                                Hayes</persName>. This paper, among other tasks, reviewed the work
                            of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and found that the value of these
                            assets had not diminished and would continue to have a role in an era
                            beyond the cold war. This opinion was unanimous.</p>
                        <p>The matter became more critical after the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> Committee was forced to reach some decisions
                            regarding covert support to various U.S. voluntary educational,
                            philanthropic and cultural endeavours. This committee and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> recommended that the
                            303 Committee examine this problem because of its unique
                                complexities.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">See <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> Since that time, Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_RWW_1">Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NPH_1">Nitze</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KFD_1">Kohler</persName>,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HRM_1">Helms</persName>, as well as <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SCL_1">Schultze</persName>, have given considerable time to looking at
                            this problem from all angles.</p>
                        <p>Some nine possible solutions were examined; these included the status
                            quo, conversion from non-profit to profit-making corporations, <pb n="514" facs="0555" xml:id="pg_514"/>reincorporation abroad,
                            relocation abroad, support by a public private mechanism, support from a
                            public private mechanism specifically designed to foster private
                            international broadcasting and other communications, overt funding by
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> (or another agency of the
                            Executive Branch), transfer to <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and
                            termination. All were eliminated in 303 discussions except for the three
                            possibilities:</p>
                        <quote><p>a. continued financing by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>;</p>
                            <p>b. financing through a public private mechanism to be established by

                            <p>c. transfer to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p></quote>
                        <p>It was these three approaches that were tackled on a priority basis by
                                <persName corresp="#p_TWC_1">William Trueheart</persName> of State
                            and an interagency group.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">Neither the

                                its report was found.</note> The conclusion reached in this solid
                            study was that there were really but two realistic choices: either
                            continuation as now constituted or termination. Some basic conclusions
                            from this report are quoted:</p>
                        <p>“A special Radio Study Group (RSG), with representatives from State
                            (Chairman), White House, Bureau of the Budget, Defense, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, was directed to conduct this further study and make
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <p>“The RSG has concluded that <hi rend="italic">RFE operations should be
                                continued on substantially the present scale</hi>. RFE broadcasts
                            make and can continue to make a significant contribution to U.S.
                            objectives in Eastern Europe in promoting and encouraging internal
                            pressures for reform and political liberalization (de-Stalinization) and
                            for the attenuation of Soviet influence and control. Further, we believe
                            that the broadcasts are not incompatible with a policy of
                            bridge-building; indeed, meaningful improvement in East-West relations
                            is probably dependent in the long run on the kind of internal changes
                            which RFE seeks to foster. The unique element of RFE broadcasts—detailed
                            reporting and comment on internal developments—could not be duplicated
                            by <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> without substantial changes in
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> operating principles and the
                            risk of unacceptable diplomatic consequences. Nor do we believe that
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> could realistically be
                            expected, partly but not wholly for budgetary reasons, to maintain the
                            massive news-gathering and research operations on which effective
                            programming of the RFE sort depends.</p>
                        <p>“The case for continuing RL is less clear because it is impossible to
                            obtain relatively reliable data, such as we have for RFE, on the size
                            and make-up of the RL audience. We do know that the massive Soviet
                            jamming operation makes listening difficult at best. As against this,
                            the RL target is incomparably more important than that of RFE, audi<pb n="515" facs="0556" xml:id="pg_515"/>ence access to foreign
                            information other than by radio is very much less, and developments in
                            the Soviet Union could make retention of RL’s capability of substantial
                            importance. The Soviet jamming effort (at least 160 jamming centers)
                            itself attests to the effectiveness, at least potentially, of the
                            broadcasts and argues against according the windfall which termination
                            would represent. <hi rend="italic">On balance, we believe that RL
                                operations should also be continued on substantially the present
                                scale</hi>.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Both RFE and RL represent important U.S. assets, in
                                terms of rare talent, specialized organization and base facilities,
                                which it has taken over 15 years and some $350 million to
                                develop</hi>. Once dispersed, they could be recreated only with
                            immense difficulty, if at all. We believe that this in itself is a
                            powerful argument for continuing the operations for the time being.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">On the other hand, RFE and RL should not be regarded
                                as permanent enterprises</hi>. The situation in the target countries
                            may over time so develop as to make the broadcasts superfluous.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">If the radios are to be continued, we see no
                                satisfactory alternative to continued <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> financing</hi>. Our judgment and that of those we
                            have consulted—including some who have earlier advocated other
                            solutions—is that normal Congressional appropriation procedures would

                            might suffer as well. Even if this were not so, the extensive and annual

                            appropriation procedure, in short, would firmly fix the image of the
                            radios as official instruments of the U.S. Government and, in our view,
                            this image would not be significantly blurred by the device of the

                        <p>“The third approach to the ‘enriched <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’ alternative was technical. . . The subgroup report brings
                            out that ‘the entire shortwave system of the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> is being used at maximum capacity for broadcasting to
                            the European area at the present time during reasonable listening
                            hours.’ Hence additional broadcasting during such hours would require
                            additional transmitters.</p>
                        <p>“A fourth consideration is that enrichment of <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> programs would also require <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> to absorb at least some substantial part of the <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> news-gathering, research, and
                            program personnel and facilities. Embassy Bonn believes that ‘if the
                                <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> executive and professional
                            staffs became U.S. Government employees, the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> would certainly view the status of the organizations as
                            having basically changed.’</p>
                        <p>“More basic than any of the foregoing is the question whether <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> world-wide broadcasting policies,
                            evolved over the years, <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be changed—quite
                            apart from the practicality of doing so. The Study Group thought this
                            question went well beyond its mandate.</p>
                        <p>“Apart from the question of the ‘enriched, country-oriented <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss>’, the <gloss target="#t_BOB_1">BOB</gloss> dissent boils down to a questioning of the majority
                            view on the public reaction to acknowledging U.S. Government support and
                            Congressional reaction to continued <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            funding. The former is a matter of judgment; the latter can only be
                            assessed by consultation with the Congress—which the Study Group assumed
                            would be the first order of business if the basic recommendation is
                            approved.”</p>
                        <p>However, Budget Director <persName corresp="#p_SCL_1">Schultze</persName>
                            has expressed serious doubts, both orally at the 303 Committee meeting
                            on 20 September 1967 and later on paper, about the proposal to
                            acknowledge government support <pb n="520" facs="0561" xml:id="pg_520"/>and continue <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> financing of both
                            RFE and RL, with or without a public exception to the policy developed
                            by the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> Committee. He
                            believes the principal disadvantages of this course of action are:</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding will be obvious; it is
                            the only source of covert funding for this type of activity.</p>
                        <p>—Continued <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding of an
                            acknowledged activity will create serious problems in Congress:</p>
                        <quote><p>—Congress has already eliminated all funding for RFE and RL after
                                December 31, 1967, except termination costs.</p>
                            <p>—<persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> are strongly opposed to
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding of activities that
                                are not wholly covert. (On these grounds, Congress cut out <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding of the Vietnam
                                Revolutionary Development Worker program.)</p>
                            <p>—We should be very careful not to start the practice of having <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> finance activities simply because
                                Congress won’t provide funds otherwise.</p></quote>
                        <p>—Public acknowledgement of continued covert U.S. Government financing
                            will cast doubt on the credibility of the whole <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> policy.</p>
                        <p>—Though there has been considerable speculation about <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding, the acknowledgement of
                            support would be given a big play in the press and will provide
                            ammunition to attack the Administration.</p>
                        <p>There are two alternatives to the proposed course of action which would
                            avoid the dangers cited above and keep open our options on Radio Free
                            Europe. The options are:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Terminate Radio Liberty and, before December 31,
                                prefund RFE for an 18–21 month period</hi>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCL_1">Schultze</persName> believes the case for RL is
                            weak and termination would simplify the problem. Pre-funding RFE would
                            require the approval of <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName>, but they are more
                            likely to agree to this one-shot action than to continued <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding. No exception to the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> policy would be required.
                            We would have time to develop a plan either to provide alternative means
                            of overt support or to fold the valuable RFE activities into <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in connection with the 1970
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Terminate RL and seek an open appropriation to
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> to support RFE</hi>. The
                            main disadvantages of this lie in the risk of congressional turndown,
                            the inevitable congressional comparisons between <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> and RFE and the effect of open support
                            on the target countries and the countries where the transmitters are
                            located.</p>
                        <p>The 303 Committee, in discussing these opinions on 20 September 1967,
                            recommended that Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName>’s views be sought and the matter brought to
                            your attention.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, this is basically a political decision with some far-ranging
                            repercussions regardless of the way the issue is decided. We have built
                                <pb n="521" facs="0562" xml:id="pg_521"/>up a $350,000,000 asset; it
                            has been and is a useful instrument; by terminating, we will indeed lose
                            something. By continuing as is, with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> funding, certain credibility risks exist.</p>
                        <p>As we see it, the risks of termination are as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. We would be surrendering without any <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                quo</hi> a proven instrument for affecting the rate of change in
                            Soviet and Eastern European societies.</p>
                        <p>b. We would, in other words, be making a unilateral concession to the
                            other side.</p>
                        <p>c. There could be a Western European reaction in which they could
                            construe the termination of <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> as
                            an acceptance of Communist domination of Eastern Europe after 17 years
                            of opposition.</p>
                        <p>d. Within the United States, certain blocs within both Democratic and
                            Republican parties would consider the termination as outright
                            appeasement. Certain ethnic minority groups of Eastern European origin
                            with powerful regional strength in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit,
                            etc., and a political voice through such congressmen as Pucinski and
                            Zablocki could be both vociferous and intemperate.</p>
                        <p>e. There is more than a possibility that <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName> or another Republican candidate, in
                            casting about for issues, could go flat-out against bridge-building. The
                            liquidation of <gloss target="#t_RFERL_1">RFE/RL</gloss> could provide
                            some gunpowder for such an attack.</p>
                        <p>f. Last but not least, a decision to liquidate might well be taken quite
                            personally by such individuals as <persName corresp="#p_HML_1">Michael
                                Haider</persName> of Standard Oil, Crawford Greenwalt, <persName corresp="#p_SF_1">Frank Stanton</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LRE_1">Roy Larsen</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_BRM_1">Roger Blough</persName>. These men have had long
                            association with this effort and, we have reason to believe, feel
                            strongly about it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Continuation</hi> as recommended with continued <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> financing entails the following
                            hazards:</p>
                        <p>a. If the State Department scenario is followed in which the United
                            States government admits covert funding, it is definitely open to the
                            charge: How can you call this an open subsidy if you won’t reveal how
                            much and from where? Both the press and Congress may find this
                            unpalatable.</p>
                        <p>b. If it is claimed by the government that, yes, this is an exception to
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> ruling, the press
                            could lean heavily on this and the only truthful answer is that no other
                            solution has been found.</p>
                        <p>c. Any large-scale press play—something very difficult to forecast—may
                            directly affect the present satisfactory attitudes of the Portuguese,
                            Spanish and Germans, who control as host governments the leasing and
                            transmitting site facilities. An open disclosure by itself could
                            adversely affect the attitudes of these governments.</p>
                        <p><pb n="522" facs="0563" xml:id="pg_522"/>We have desisted from initial
                            feelers among members of Congress because we felt this issue was
                            sufficiently subtle so that you would prefer to design the strategy and
                            name the strategists yourself.</p>
                        <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> have been briefed on this

                            OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <p>Much of our Western European program—indeed, much of U.S. policy toward
                            Europe—is based on the assumption that similarities of civilization,
                            ethnic composition and socio-economic development make the basic
                            interests of Europeans and Americans similar. The results of this
                            survey, following upon and confirming a similar survey in February, show
                            that the psychological foundation for this approach to Western Europeans
                            is growing shaky.<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> We are thus faced with a fundamental problem.
                            Some of the questions we need to answer are:</p>
                        <p>1.<hi rend="italic"> What is the nature of the problem?</hi></p>
                        <p>Are Europeans correct in thinking that their interests are less close to
                            those of the United States than was the case a few years ago? Or are
                            they deluded? To what extent is the change one of mind on the part of
                            individual Europeans? To what extent does it reflect the fact that
                            unlike a few years ago the younger members of our samples are people who
                            did not directly experience as adults the conditions that <pb n="523" facs="0564" xml:id="pg_523"/>brought about an Atlantic

                                with a united Europe the ways and means of forming a concrete
                                Atlantic partnership, a mutually beneficial partnership between the

                        <p>To counter the barrage of misinformation presented by the world press on
                            Viet-Nam, we have increased our output on Viet-Nam subjects through
                            television and films as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> was interviewed
                            on television by five European journalists.<note n="2" xml:id="d169fn2">On October 16, <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> was
                                interviewed at the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> television
                                studio in Washington by five journalists from West Germany, Italy,
                                Australia, France, and the Netherlands. For a transcript of the
                                interview, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                November 6, 1967, pp. 595–602.</note> Before undertaking the
                            program, we received commitments from television organizations in
                            approximately 25 countries that they would carry such a program.</p>
                        <p>A previous appearance of this nature by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> was very successful and was
                            carried in about 60 countries, and also shown repeatedly at <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> auditoriums and in private Embassy

                            which he will review “Where we are in Viet-Nam.”</p>
                        <p>3. A documentary film using newsclips dating back to the French
                            involvement in Viet-Nam will be prepared explaining, “Why the United
                            States is involved in the present controversy.”</p>
                        <p>4. Based upon recent conversations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGC_2">George McGhee</persName> and other European
                            Ambassadors, I am inaugurating a series of five or ten-minute news clips
                            that can be sent to European capitals for inclusion in regular news
                            programs over their television facilities.</p>
                        <p>During my recent visit to London, Madrid and Lisbon, I was told
                            repeatedly by journalists in those capitals that public opinion in
                            Europe is based upon fragmentary, erroneous and frequently distorted
                            reports emanating from U.S. news services, magazines and television
                            newsreels. It is difficult, if not impossible, to counter these reports
                            without <pb n="525" facs="0566" xml:id="pg_525"/>a world-wide news
                            gathering and film clip service. The efforts recited above will at best
                            be a limited response to this daily barrage.</p>
                        <p>Despite repeated and continuing efforts with the Information Ministry of
                            the Government of Viet-Nam, there has been little progress in supplying
                            press officers with assistance in the embassies located in principal
                            world capitals. In London, I was informed that the Government of
                            Viet-Nam Embassy receives “virtually no logistical support from its
                            government” and as a result <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> must
                            bear the principal burden of supplying press and pamphlet materials and
                            advising on press relations. A similar report was received from Rome.
                            Good cooperation exists at these embassies but the program would be far
                            more effective if Saigon were able to supply the necessary
                                assistance.<note n="4" xml:id="d169fn4"><persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> echoed the same observation he shared with

                                July trip to Vietnam: “There is a desperate urgency for the

                        <p>On September 23 a bitter anti-U.S. attack was shown on Soviet television
                            during prime time. Our post reports that the program featured our
                            involvement in Viet-Nam, the “brutalization of western civilization” and
                            the “threat of foreign tourism in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.” The following is an excerpt from that report:</p>

                                disgust for the barbaric aggressors, explained that U.S. policy is
                                bankrupt. The North Vietnamese will soon hang their wash on the
                                McNamarra wall, a barrier created as an election gimmick to dupe
                                Americans that the war is not futile. The commentator asks with
                                barbed hostility: “Americans, what do you think of your war in
                                Vietnam? We are listening to you!”</p>

                            <p>The commentator interrupts: “Thanks, Mister President, for your clear

                            willingness for me to consult those leaders of Congress <pb n="527" facs="0568" xml:id="pg_527"/>having to do with appropriations in an
                            effort to establish whether or not they would be willing to continue
                            appropriating money for these radios on the understanding that this
                            would not constitute a request by you for this money or a charge against
                            your congressional program.</p>
                        <p>2. As a result, I visited individually with five members of Congress:
                            Representatives <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> of Texas,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BFT_1">Bow</persName> of Ohio, <persName corresp="#p_LGP_1">Lipscomb</persName> of California, and Senators
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> of Georgia and
                                <persName corresp="#p_YMR_1">Milton Young</persName> of North
                            Dakota. All five of these individuals expressed a willingness to support
                            the radios financially in the round amount of $30,000,000 per annum for
                            at least the next fiscal year and possibly longer.</p>
                        <p>3. At my visit with each of those five individuals, I explained in detail
                            the problem we have had in finding alternative means of financing those
                            radios. I made it clear that a public relations problem still exists in
                            terms of how the Administration explains the continuance of the present
                            financial arrangements. On the other hand, if there is no firm assurance
                            of congressional support for the radios, there is no need to waste time
                            on devising the right tactical approach to the press. I carefully
                            underlined that I was there on my own since you wanted it clearly
                            understood that you did not want to make a personal appeal for the money
                            involved nor did you feel that you should be asked to plead for these
                            radios as against other projects which you felt to be more essential. It
                            was my distinct impression that each individual understood the terms of
                            the discussion quite clearly.</p>
                        <p>4. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> reacted to
                            my presentation by saying that he had felt it had been a mistake to
                            include the radios in the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName> report<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">See <ref target="#d144fn3">footnote 3, Document 144</ref>.</note> and
                            that he had always preferred to have them continue to operate as they
                            had in the past.<note n="4" xml:id="d170fn4">An unknown hand highlighted
                                this sentence in yellow.</note> He recognized the public relations
                            problems but stated that it did not concern him unduly even if there
                            were some criticism. (At this point, he made a disparaging reference to
                            the influence of THE NEW YORK TIMES and told me “I never read <persName corresp="#p_RJB_1">Reston</persName>.”) He then remarked that he
                            thought the radios should be continued and that he was prepared to help
                            provide the necessary funds. He pointed out, however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFT_1">Bow</persName> would have to agree and asked me
                            to see both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BFT_1">Bow</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGP_1">Lipscomb</persName>, the two Republican
                            members of his <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Appropriations

                        <p>5. Representative <persName corresp="#p_BFT_1">Bow</persName> told me
                            that he thought the radios were doing a good job and that they should be
                                continued.<note n="6" xml:id="d170fn6">An unknown hand highlighted
                                this sentence in yellow.</note> He promised to <pb n="528" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_528"/>help provide the money. In the course
                            of our conversation, he pointed out that he was on the Appropriations
                            Subcommittee which deals with <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> and
                            that in his opinion it would make no sense to try to meld Radio Free
                            Europe and/or Radio Liberty into the Voice of America organization. He
                            indicated that he clearly understood the difference in the program
                            content of the Voice of America on the one hand and the two “private”
                            radios on the other. He concluded by opining that this was no time in
                            history to reduce our efforts to bring about change behind the Iron
                                Curtain.<note n="7" xml:id="d170fn7">An unknown hand highlighted

                        <p>6. Representative <persName corresp="#p_LGP_1">Lipscomb</persName> said
                            that he was in favor of the radios and did not want to see them
                                terminated.<note n="8" xml:id="d170fn8">An unknown hand highlighted
                                this sentence in yellow.</note> He volunteered to do what he could
                            to have the money appropriated and asked a few questions about the
                            amounts involved and how they were allocated. He accepted the fact that
                            some admission of government support might have to be made. He stated
                            that this would present “a tricky problem” in dealing with the press but
                            did not anticipate widespread newspaper criticism.<note n="9" xml:id="d170fn9">An unknown hand highlighted from “this would
                                present” through the end of this paragraph in yellow.</note></p>
                        <p>7. Senator <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName> expressed his
                            support of the radios and said that he thought they ought to be
                            continued at least for a time.<note n="10" xml:id="d170fn10">An unknown
                                hand highlighted this sentence in yellow.</note> He repeated what he
                            has said before that he never could understand what all the ruckus had
                            been about. He pointed out that criticism over these subsidies had died
                            out quickly after the initial flurry last winter. He indicated his
                            willingness to help secure the money involved and asked me to go see
                            Senator <persName corresp="#p_YMR_1">Young</persName> and put the matter
                            to him.<note n="11" xml:id="d170fn11">An unknown hand highlighted from
                                “asked me to” through the end of this sentence in yellow.</note> He
                            authorized me to tell Senator <persName corresp="#p_YMR_1">Young</persName> that he favored continuing the radios.</p>
                        <p>8. When I met with Senator <persName corresp="#p_YMR_1">Young</persName>,
                            I told him that Senator <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName>
                            had asked me to see him, but I did not attempt to influence his decision
                            by telling him in advance what Senator <persName corresp="#p_RRB_1">Russell</persName>’s position was. He did not even inquire. He
                            simply stated that he thought the radios should continue to operate and
                            that he would do what he could to help as far as appropriations are
                                concerned.<note n="12" xml:id="d170fn12">An unknown hand highlighted

                                in yellow.</note> He expressed the opinion that the state of the
                            world being what it was, no useful efforts to deal with <pb n="529" facs="0570" xml:id="pg_529"/>Communism or Communist ideology should

                        <p>9. I have reported the above to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>. We will again raise with you shortly how we should

                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName> offered the
                            President only television receivers: no “stations,” transmitters,
                            studios, technicians, or advisors were mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sato</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The transmitters presently in operation or scheduled for operation within
                            Viet-Nam are sufficient to support whatever educational television
                            projects we could reasonably envisage.</p>
                        <p><pb n="530" facs="0571" xml:id="pg_530"/>The present studios probably can
                            suffice, depending on how efficiently we can schedule them and the
                            degree of austerity the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> is willing
                            to assign to the projects (obviously, an ambitious television producer
                            working toward highest U.S. operational standards could recommend new,
                            separate, complex, and expensive studios: I believe we should try to get
                            along without them).</p>
                        <p>Some additional technical assistance will be necessary to establish
                            production standards, and we are in contact with such persons already
                            (at least one of them, Loren Stone from the University of Washington,
                            has been working with us on television in Viet-Nam for some time now and
                            is well known and respected by <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>
                            officials now engaged in television projects). Too, we will need some
                            first-class educational specialists who can devise reasonable methods
                            for integrating television instruction into the present and developing
                            educational plant of the country (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> is very familiar with what is required and will
                            make some recommendations soon). In any case, both the limited technical
                            assistance and the educational advisors to consult on the proper
                            introduction of television into the school system of Viet-Nam should be
                            funded by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>. I hope that when Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> meets with the

                                techniques.” They further agreed to form a joint committee, which
                                would also include South Vietnam, to work out the details of the

                        <p>We should hope for a realistic, modest plan by the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> to use television as a supplementary

                            can be improved. On the basis of what I know now, it would appear that
                            educational television could be begun most meaningfully in the Saigon

                        <p rend="center">VIET-NAM IN PERSPECTIVE</p>
                        <p>(1) QUESTION: Why is the United States fighting in Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In the most basic terms: The U.S. is in Viet-Nam because (a) the
                            peace and security of Southeast Asia are vital to the U.S. national
                            interest; (b) the U.S. has solemn commitments to aid South Viet-Nam
                            (SVN) against aggression; we will keep our pledge to assist SVN, as we
                            would assist other nations with whom we have similar commitments through
                            agreements and treaties; (c) we believe that nations, large and small,
                            have the right to chart their own destinies without the threat of
                            external force and interference.</p>
                        <p>Because we have a vital interest in the peace and security of Southeast
                            Asia, we joined other powers in signing the Southeast Asia Collective
                            Defense Treaty (<gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss>) of 1954, which
                            the U.S. Senate approved by an 82-to-1 vote.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">See <ref target="#d124fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            124</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>One of the most important provisions of that treaty states that “each
                            party recognizes that aggression by means of armed attack in the treaty
                            area . . . would endanger its own peace and safety,” and, in that event,
                            would “act to meet the common danger.” A protocol, signed and approved
                            with the treaty, extended this provision to the non-Communist states of
                            former French Indo-China (Viet-Nam, Laos, Cambodia).<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">For text of the Protocol, see 6 U.S.T.
                            81.</note></p>
                        <p>At the request of the Government of SVN, and in keeping with our <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> obligations, we went to the aid of
                            South Viet-Nam when that country was subjected to “aggression by means
                            of armed attack” from the north. We are helping the people of South
                            Viet-Nam and their government to defend themselves against aggression
                            directed, politically and militarily, and largely supplied by North
                            Viet-Nam. The <pb n="533" facs="0574" xml:id="pg_533"/>so-called “war of
                            national liberation” in Viet-Nam is nothing more than a new form of
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>We seek only to help the South Vietnamese people control their own
                            destiny, determine their own future, lead their own lives as they choose
                            and not as imposed by Hanoi. We do not seek to overthrow or destroy the
                            Government of North Viet-Nam. We are determined to prevent its
                            aggression from succeeding.</p>
                        <p>(2) QUESTION: Is there really any legal basis for U.S. military aid to
                            South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: U.S. actions are justified under the <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty, the Geneva Accords of 1954, and Article 51 of
                            the United Nations Charter.</p>
                        <p>The right of self-defense against armed attack is recognized in Article
                            51 of the U.N. Charter (“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the
                            inherent right of individual or collective self-defense . . .”).</p>
                        <p>North Viet-Nam violated the Geneva accords in instigating, directing and
                            sustaining armed attack against South Viet-Nam.<note n="4" xml:id="d172fn4">For further information about the Geneva Accords,
                                see <ref target="#d71fn2">footnote 2, Document 71</ref>.</note> As
                            the victim of armed attack, South Viet-Nam has the right of
                            self-defense, and to have the assistance of others in that defense.
                            South Viet-Nam asked for such assistance. In line with Article IV of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty, the U.S. and four
                            other <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> members have undertaken
                            to “act to meet the common danger in accordance with [their]
                            constitutional processes.”</p>
                        <p>In addition, on August 10, 1964, the U.S. Congress—with only two
                            dissenting votes—authorized U.S. participation in the collective defense
                            of South Viet-Nam.<note n="5" xml:id="d172fn5">Reference is to the Gulf
                                of Tonkin Resolution or Joint Resolution 1145, “To Promote the
                                Maintenance of International Peace and Security in Southeast Asia.”

                        <p>(3) QUESTION: If the war in Viet-Nam is such a threat to Asia, why have
                            so few <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> members joined the U.S.
                            in Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: France, Pakistan and the United Kingdom have not contributed
                            militarily to Viet-Nam. All the other <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> signatories—the U.S., Thailand, the Philippines,
                            Australia, and New Zealand—have troops in South Viet-Nam. Thus, all five
                            Asian-Pacific members of <gloss target="#t_SEATO_1">SEATO</gloss> are
                            fighting side by side with South Vietnamese troops.</p>
                        <p>South Korea, with some 48,000 front-line troops, is making a major
                            contribution in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Other Asian nations—Japan, the Republic of China, and Malaysia—have
                            supplied medical teams, technicians, advisers, and economic and
                            educational assistance to South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p><pb n="534" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_534"/>In all, more than 30 countries
                            are providing South Viet-Nam with non-military assistance in one form or
                            another. More than two dozen medical and surgical teams from various
                            countries are working in South Viet-Nam, caring for civilian needs as
                            well as military casualties.</p>
                        <p>Among the non-Asian contributors of assistance are Canada, the German
                            Federal Republic, Iran, Italy, and the Netherlands. These countries have
                            sent doctors, nurses, teachers, agricultural advisers, engineers and
                            other technical personnel to help bring a better life to all the South
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>(4) QUESTION: Why is the U.S. reluctant to bring the question of peace in
                            Viet-Nam before the United Nations?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: There is no reluctance on the part of the U.S. We have repeatedly

                        <p>Since the summer of 1964 Hanoi has taken the position that (a) the U.N.

                            consider null and void any Security Council resolution on the Viet-Nam
                            question. During the February 1–2, 1966, Security Council discussions of

                            possible peace negotiations?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. would welcome the reconvening of such a conference to
                            discuss Viet-Nam and the future of Southeast Asia. The United States has
                            made this clear on numerous occasions.</p>

                            to be rebuffed in this endeavor by the other co-chairman, the Soviet
                            Union. Like the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, Hanoi has

                            considerable segment of the population of South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> itself claims to be the
                                <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> legitimate representative of all the
                            South Vietnamese, not just a portion of them.</p>
                        <p>But the South Vietnamese do not accept the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> as their “sole representative” or “only legitimate
                            voice.” South Viet-Nam has many groups with different religious and
                            ethnic origins, including Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, Cambodians, and Montagnards.
                            These groups, and certainly the almost one million refugees who fled
                            from North Viet-Nam to the south in 1954–55, do not recognize the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> as their “sole” spokesman.</p>
                        <p>(8) QUESTION: What evidence is there that the Saigon government has any
                            better claim than the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> to be the
                            “sole” representative of the people of South Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p><pb n="536" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_536"/>ANSWER: In the summer of 1967,
                            83 per cent of 5.8 million registered South Vietnamese voters elected a
                            government of their own choice.</p>
                        <p>Of course those South Vietnamese in areas under Viet Cong control were
                            unable either to register or to vote. But of those who were free of Viet
                            Cong control and eligible to register, some 70 per cent did register.
                            And 83 per cent of the registered electorate cast ballots for leaders of
                            their choice.</p>
                        <p>That choice was a clear rejection of the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>’s claim to represent the South Vietnamese people.
                            Through assassinations, kidnapping, and other forms of intimidation, the
                            Viet Cong tried to disrupt the elections in areas they did not control.
                            Most of the eligible voters were not deterred from making their choice.
                            The turnout at the polls shows that the Viet Cong not only failed in
                            their objective but do not have the popular support they claim.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, the elections were almost a miracle in politics.
                            In the midst of a cruel, mean guerrilla war, under constant Viet Cong
                            terror and threat, it took courage to vote. Nevertheless the elections
                            took place, and provided an example of free choice in democratic
                            diversity.</p>
                        <p>There was ample diversity, a wide range of choice, in those elections.
                            There were “peace” candidates, and “hawks” as well. In both the
                            presidential and assembly elections there were many issues, many
                            proposals, many candidates. The new Saigon government and its leaders
                            represent the outcome—the product of the determined exercise of free
                            choice by the South Vietnamese who were free to choose.</p>
                        <p>(9) QUESTION: Hanoi termed the elections a “farce,” and denounced the
                            victors—Generals Thieu and Ky—as “puppets.” Isn’t there some basis for
                            such charges?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: One can understand why Hanoi resorted to such bitter
                            denunciations, for it failed completely in its objective of disrupting
                            the elections.</p>
                        <p>Surely, if the elections were rigged, General Thieu would have far
                            outdistanced all opposition. As it was, he drew only 35 per cent of the
                            total vote for president. He was one of 11 candidates for the post, and
                            the people naturally scattered their votes. But the fact that the voters
                            gave him 35 per cent of the total—twice the vote for his nearest
                            rival—can be considered a very substantial demonstration of popular
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi and the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> are quick to criticize
                            elections in South Viet-Nam. The fact remains that there have never been
                            free elections either in North Viet-Nam or in areas under Viet Cong
                            military control. Some 500 foreign newsmen and observers who witnessed
                            the elections in South Viet-Nam concluded that these were generally fair
                            and free. This <pb n="537" facs="0578" xml:id="pg_537"/>means that
                            irregularities which occurred were certainly no more serious than those
                            which figure in elections in highly developed democratic countries with
                            long histories of free elections.</p>
                        <p>(10) QUESTION: Didn’t the election of Generals Thieu and Ky merely
                            perpetuate military rule?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The South Vietnamese people have civilian constitutional
                            government now. The Constituent Assembly worked hard and long to evolve
                            a strong constitution. South Viet-Nam’s elected bicameral legislature is
                            a guarantee against one-man rule or rule by any one group, including the
                            military.</p>
                        <p>The members of the Senate and House represent many different elements of
                            Vietnamese society. There is no single “military” bloc. Those military
                            men who were elected could not have won without civilian support. Eleven
                            out of sixty elected senators are military or former military men; 30 of
                            the 137 elected representatives have a military background.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that neither President Thieu nor Vice-President Ky controls a
                            dominant bloc in either the Senate or House. And in selecting his
                            cabinet, President Thieu gave ministries to only three military men; 24
                            to civilians. The Prime Minister is a Southern Buddhist civilian,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NVT_1">Nguyen Van</persName> Loc. Other
                            civilians head the key ministries of foreign affairs, of justice, and of
                            all the ministries controlling the economic and educational life of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>The cabinet is representative of the varied religious, regional and
                            ethnic groupings in Viet-Nam. There are twelve southerners, ten
                            northerners, and seven central Vietnamese. There is a rough balance
                            between Buddhist and Catholic representation. Ethnic Montagnards and
                            Chinese also are represented.</p>
                        <p>(11) QUESTION: Why are you bombing North Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The primary purpose of the bombing is to make infiltration from
                            north to south more difficult and costly for the North Vietnamese army.
                            The targets are bridges, supply depots, munitions factories, roads
                            leading south, and truck convoys and trains moving in the same
                            direction. Every possible precaution is taken to prevent bombs from
                            falling on nonmilitary targets.</p>
                        <p>(12) QUESTION: Hanoi claims the U.S. has a deliberate policy of hitting
                            targets that are not even remotely connected with the war effort, and
                            that hospitals have been a prime U.S. target. Isn’t that true?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: It is entirely possible and most regrettable that some civilian
                            targets may have been inadvertently hit, either by stray bombs or by NVN
                            anti-aircraft ordnance which comes to earth after failing to hit its
                            targets. It is not true that U.S. bombing is aimed at civilian targets.
                            None of the foreign diplomats and news correspondents from <pb n="538" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_538"/>neutral countries in Hanoi has accused
                            the U.S. of <hi rend="italic">deliberately</hi> bombing civilian
                            targets.</p>
                        <p>While there have been mistakes, for no airmen are infallible, these
                            errors hardly compare with the deliberate Viet Cong policy of terrorism
                            against civilians in South Viet-Nam. Since 1958, 58,000 civilians have
                            been killed or kidnapped in the course of the Viet Cong’s continuing,
                            systematic, premeditated program of assassination and intimidation.</p>
                        <p>(13) QUESTION: You say the U.S. is bombing North Viet-Nam to halt the
                            flow of men and supplies to the south, but you acknowledge that such
                            infiltration continues. Doesn’t this show that the policy of bombing has
                            failed?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. has never claimed that its aircraft could or would halt
                            infiltration entirely. Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName> has said repeatedly that the primary objective
                            of U.S. air action over North Viet-Nam is to reduce the flow of
                            continued infiltration of men and supplies from the north to South
                            Viet-Nam, and to increase the cost of such infiltration. The bombing
                            makes it clear to the North Vietnamese leaders that, so long as they
                            continue their aggression against the South, they have to pay a price in
                            the north.</p>
                        <p>Weighed against its stated objectives, the bombing campaign has been
                            successful. The North Vietnamese have paid, and will continue to pay, a
                            high price for their continued aggression. It has been made abundantly
                            clear to Hanoi’s leaders that they cannot expect North Viet-Nam to
                            remain a sanctuary while North Vietnamese forces conduct operations
                            freely outside their own territory.</p>
                        <p>Complete interdiction of the flow of men and supplies from north to south
                            has never been considered possible by U.S. military leaders. The air
                            assaults, however, have made North Vietnamese infiltration increasingly
                            difficult and costly.</p>
                        <p>(14) QUESTION: Many countries have urged the U.S. to stop bombing North
                            Viet-Nam. Why do you ignore such pleas?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> has
                            said the U.S. is willing to stop all aerial and naval bombardment of
                            North Viet-Nam when this will lead promptly to productive
                            discussions—provided that, while the discussions proceed, North Viet-Nam
                            would not take advantage of the bombing cessation or limitation. The
                            U.S. and many other countries consider this a reasonable and fair
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p>If Hanoi is interested in peace, all it would have to say is “Yes,”
                            publicly or privately, to the President’s offer. Unfortunately, Hanoi
                            has not responded affirmatively to this or any other proposals made by
                            the Vietnamese Government, the U.S., the U.N. Secretary General, Pope
                                <persName corresp="#p_PIBM_1">Paul</persName>, and other governments
                            and groups—all striving for peace in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p><pb n="539" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_539"/>(15) QUESTION: The leaders in
                            Hanoi and some other capitals have said talks could start when you stop
                            bombing. You ignore this signal, and insist that Hanoi accept your
                            conditions. Why are you so adamant about demanding a specific concession
                            from Hanoi to stop bombing?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: There has been considerable misunderstanding of what Hanoi has
                            said, or is supposed to have said, on the question of bombing and
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>Hanoi insists that the U.S. stop bombing, permanently and
                            unconditionally. Hanoi has said this over and over. In responding on
                            February 15, 1967, to a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> proposing the start of
                            discussions toward peace, Ho Chi Minh demanded unconditional cessation
                            of U.S. bombing and all other military activity of the U.S. troops and
                            the other allies of South Viet-Nam.<note n="12" xml:id="d172fn12">For an

                            “has merely indicated that there ‘could’ be negotiations if the bombing
                            stopped.” Some governments and individuals had expressed their belief or
                            assumption that negotiations “would” begin if bombings were halted.

                        <p>In fact, the U.S. has stopped bombing on five occasions, ranging from two
                            days in one period to 37 days in another, without any positive response
                            from Hanoi.</p>

                            will happen if the bombing stops. There is no word from Hanoi, however,
                            nor from any power which has Hanoi’s confidence.</p>
                        <p>(16) QUESTION: You claim you would do anything possible to promote peace,
                            yet you won’t halt the bombing of North Viet-Nam. How do you reconcile
                            these views?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: You can’t expect the U.S. to stop the bombing permanently without
                            some reciprocity to relieve the beleaguered South Vietnamese. This is
                            not likely to contribute toward peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>’s explanation of the
                            U.S. view on this aspect of the situation:</p>
                        <quote><p>“For us to say, ‘We will stop, you go right ahead with your war;
                                you live there safely and comfortably, without being disturbed,
                                while you send men and arms into South Viet-Nam for the next 50
                                years’—where would be the incentive for peace?</p>
                            <p>“Now, we are interested in peace; we are not interested in a
                                sanctuary which will let them carry on these operations against
                                South Viet-Nam and Laos for eternity, while they sit there in a
                                sanctuary taking their own time, paying no price, trying to seize
                                their neighbors by force.”<note n="15" xml:id="d172fn15">The quote

                        <p>That is why the U.S. needs something more than a vague indication from
                            Hanoi that talks could possibly start if the bombing stopped. Cessation
                            of bombing, without any concrete reciprocal action from the other side,
                            does not appear to be a fruitful way to move toward peace.</p>
                        <p>(17) QUESTION: It seems to me that you talk a lot about peace and
                            continue to escalate the war. Thus, you make the prospect of peace
                            increasingly difficult. How sincere can your peace gestures really
                            be?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The U.S. proposals for peace negotiations have been openly, fully
                            and clearly spelled out by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">Goldberg</persName>, and other top U.S. officials.</p>

                            been proposed more than 30 times by the U.S. itself and, collectively

                            countries. Some Communist countries have sought to bring the Viet-Nam
                            issue to the conference table. World leaders, among them Pope <persName corresp="#p_PIBM_1">Paul VI</persName> and U.N. Secretary General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU_1">U Thant</persName>, have exerted their

                        <p>The U.S. welcomed all such initiatives but Hanoi rejected them.</p>
                        <p>All Hanoi has to do to test U.S. sincerity is to agree to discuss, with

                            Viet-Nam. Doesn’t this commitment increase the risk of world war?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: We believe the possibility of world conflict would increase if
                            the U.S. abandoned its commitments in Asia, Europe or elsewhere. The
                            U.S. has allies around the world. It cannot consider some of its
                            commitments less firm or less important than others.</p>

                            war could have resulted. In the same way, it is important that North
                            Viet-Nam, Communist China, and the Soviet Union place equal credence in
                            the determination of the U.S. to fulfill its commitments in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it is clearly in the interest of world peace that the U.S. live up

                            ever signed the Geneva Accords of 1954? Does this account for the
                            failure of the U.S. in 1956 to support free elections in Viet-Nam,
                            although the Accords called for such elections?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The powers represented at the Geneva Conference of 1954 were
                            Cambodia, North Viet-Nam, South Viet-Nam, Laos, Communist China, the

                            representatives of Canada, India, and Poland—to supervise the execu<pb n="542" facs="0583" xml:id="pg_542"/>tion of the agreements. The
                            Final Declaration of the conference called for free elections in 1956 to
                            bring about unification of Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>At that time South Viet-Nam not only protested the partitioning of the
                            country, but also emphasized the impossibility of holding free elections
                            in the Communist-controlled north. Therefore SVN did not accept the
                            Final Declaration. The United States did not join in the Final
                            Declaration because of reservations about certain features of the
                            Accords—in particular, their failure to include United Nations
                            supervision of the proposed 1956 elections. The United States, however,
                            issued a unilateral declaration<note n="18" xml:id="d172fn18">Reference
                                is to the July 21, 1954, declaration made by Under Secretary of
                                State Walter Bedell Smith on behalf of the United States at the
                                conclusion of the Geneva Conference. For a text, see <ref target="frus1952-54v13p2#d1073"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            U.S. would (a) refrain from the threat or use of force to disturb the
                            Geneva Agreements, but (b) view any renewal of aggression in violation
                            of the accords as seriously threatening international peace and
                            security.</p>
                        <p>By 1956, when the elections were to be held, the situation in North
                            Viet-Nam showed that free elections were in fact not possible in the
                            north. Under such conditions, the RVN did not consider itself obliged to
                            take part in elections which (a) could not be free, (b) would greatly
                            favor more populous North Viet-Nam, and (c) could only result in the
                            takeover of South Viet-Nam by the Hanoi regime.</p>

                        <p>(20) QUESTION: Aren’t the Viet Cong, in reality, revolutionaries engaged
                            in a war of national liberation?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In Communist terminology, a “war of national liberation” means a
                            war to achieve eventual Communist control. This clearly applies to the
                            Viet-Nam war.</p>
                        <p>In an article written for <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> on the 50th
                            anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, <persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Ho
                                Chi Minh</persName> said that victory in a “war of national
                            liberation” can be won only when it has developed into a Communist
                            revolution. <persName corresp="#p_HCM_1">Ho</persName> wrote:</p>
                        <quote><p>“Only with the leadership of a party that knows how to apply
                                Marxism-Leninism in a creative manner to the practical conditions of

                                the socialist revolution to success.”</p></quote>
                        <p>A war of national liberation, therefore, is the form of aggression which
                            stimulates and exploits dissidence and violence within a non-Communist
                            state in order to subvert that state. It uses the tactics of terror and
                            sabotage, of stealth and subversion. It readily serves the purposes of a
                            disciplined minority, particularly in countries where the physical
                            terrain makes clandestine infiltration relatively easy.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the conflict in South Viet-Nam is very clear. The
                            “liberation” proposed by Hanoi and the so-called “National Front for the
                            Liberation of South Viet-Nam” means a Communist takeover of SVN by
                            force, and an end to the free choice of the South Vietnamese in
                            determining how they will live and govern themselves.</p>
                        <p>(21) QUESTION: Who, then, are the Viet Cong?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: Viet Cong means Vietnamese Communist. It refers to the military
                            forces and political cadres of the National Liberation Front. The <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> is the invention and instrument of the
                            Lao Dong—the Communist Party of North Viet-Nam. The <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> is designed to cloak Hanoi’s
                            continuing efforts to overthrow the government in the south, establish a
                            Communist regime, and unify the country under the government in
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>(22) QUESTION: What proof have you that Hanoi invented the NLP and now
                            controls it? Many people believe that the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> is a genuine South Vietnamese indigenous nationalist
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In 1959, Hanoi openly called for “national liberation” of the
                            south, using (a) an estimated 5,000 Communist cadre left in South
                            Viet-Nam after the 1954 division, and (b) additional cadre infiltrated
                            from the north. This 1959 decision was best described by North
                            Viet-Nam’s military leader, General Vo Nguyen Giap, who said:</p>
                        <quote><p>“The north is the revolutionary base for the whole
                            country.”</p></quote>
                        <p>In establishing the National Liberation Front in 1960, Hanoi sought to
                            create the fiction that the north was not directing the effort in the
                            south. The <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> attracted a following by
                            skillful organization and propaganda, selectively reinforced by the use
                            of terrorism; and by exploiting the theme of social injustice, with
                            promises of a variety of economic and government “reforms.” Much of the
                            following of the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> has been
                            involuntary. Thousands of former Viet Cong have testified that they were
                            driven to cooperate by fear of reprisals against them or their families.
                            Viet Cong claims of widespread popular support also are tellingly
                            refuted by the absence in the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>’s
                            leadership of any Vietnamese of national stature.</p>
                        <p>In 1961, Hanoi sought to convince the world that the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> was a genuinely indigenous southern,
                            nationalist movement. It did this by <pb n="544" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_544"/>creating the name “People’s Revolutionary Party”
                            (PRP) for the principal element of the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>, which until then had been the southern branch of the
                            Lao Dong Party of NVN. A captured secret document of the Lao Dong Party,
                            the North Vietnamese Communist Party, disclosed the facts. The document
                            revealed that in November, 1961, the Party’s Central Committee passed a
                            resolution which makes clear that the PRP differed only in name from the
                            Lao Dong Party:</p>

                        <p>(23) QUESTION: You insist that Hanoi controls the <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> and directs the war in the south; yet
                            Hanoi does not admit it has troops in South Viet-Nam. How can Hanoi
                            control the war without the use of its own regulars?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: From prisoners, documents, films and numerous defectors, we have
                            solid proof of the presence in South Viet-Nam of about 55,000 North
                            Vietnamese army regulars. We know the numbers of their divisions and
                            regiments, and even the dates when they entered the south. We know that
                            other regulars from NVN—in addition to the 55,000—serve in Viet Cong
                            ranks. We have photos and films of North Vietnamese generals, including
                            the late General Nguyen Chi Thanh, directing North Vietnamese troops in
                            the south. We have orders and various memoranda sent to these troops and
                            to the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> from Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Since the 1959 decision in Hanoi to launch a major military campaign in
                            the south, more than 100,000 fighting men and tons of military equipment
                            and supplies have been moved into the south from the north.</p>
                        <p>In June, 1962, the Indian and Canadian members of the International
                            Control Commission—with the Poles dissenting—investigated South
                            Vietnamese charges of North Vietnamese activities in the south.<note n="20" xml:id="d172fn20">See “Saigon Hails Report,” <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, June 26, 1962, p. 8.</note>
                            The Indians and Canadians concluded:</p>
                        <quote><p>“In specific instances there is evidence to show that armed and
                                unarmed personnel, arms, munitions, and other supplies have been
                                sent from the Zone in the north to the Zone in the south, with the
                                object of carrying out hostile activities, including armed attacks
                                directed against the Armed Forces and Administration of the Zone in
                                the south. These acts are in violation of Articles 10, 19, 24 and 27
                                of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in
                            Viet-Nam.”</p></quote>
                        <p><pb n="545" facs="0586" xml:id="pg_545"/>Since 1962, more evidence has
                            rapidly accumulated. We can now reconstruct the chain of events that led
                            to the current presence in the south of more than 55,000 North
                            Vietnamese regulars.</p>
                        <p>Early in 1964, the Communists believed that an <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss> victory in the south was imminent. South Viet-Nam was
                            in a state of grave political unrest. The Diem regime had fallen, the
                            Viet Cong had stepped up subversion and terror, and the South Vietnamese
                            army had suffered numerous setbacks. Sensing that victory was possible,
                            Hanoi committed regular troops and vast new resources for a final blow.
                            Documents prove that this decision was made early in 1964—well before
                            the first U.S. combat units arrived in South Viet-Nam in May, 1965.</p>
                        <p>Prisoners from the 95th Regiment and 325th Division of the regular North
                            Vietnamese Army (NVA) have revealed they were being prepared for
                            infiltration in April, 1964. The first regular NVA units began arriving
                            in the south in November, 1964. The first complete tactical unit of the
                            NVA—the 808th Battalion, with cadre drawn largely from the 325th
                            Division—reached the south in November, 1964; it was joined the
                            following month by other elements of the 325th Division, including the
                            95th Regiment.</p>
                        <p>The trickle soon became a steady flow. By the end of 1965, there were
                            some 26,000 North Vietnamese Army regulars in the south; in 1966, more
                            than 40,000. In 1965, NVA regulars comprised about one-fourth of the
                            total main-force Communist strength in the south. By the end of 1966,
                            there were 63 NVA battalions and 83 Viet Cong battalions. In all, the
                            NVA regulars then constituted almost 43 per cent of the Communist main
                            force. And this proportion rose to 45 per cent by mid-1967.</p>
                        <p>(24) QUESTION: Still, the number of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces
                            does not approach the total of South Vietnamese, U.S. and other forces
                            in South Viet-Nam. Doesn’t this indicate that the Viet Cong have been
                            able to continue their operations because, unlike the Saigon government,
                            they have the support of the masses?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: There is little evidence of popular support for the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>. Why should the peasants support the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>, who have killed or kidnapped
                            58,000 South Vietnamese peasants, village officials and local government
                            workers since 1958? Why support the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss>,
                            who are now levying taxes at a rate higher than Saigon’s rate, and who
                            are even now forcing South Vietnamese youth to join their forces?</p>
                        <p>The Viet Cong today control at best some 17 per cent of the population in
                            SVN. The <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> method of control remains,
                            basically, the use and threat of terror. It is not surprising that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> are now losing the support of the

                            Cong defections have increased. In 1964 there were 5,417 Viet Cong

                        <p>In 1966, the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> controlled areas
                            inhabited by about 55 per cent of the population. By November, 1967, it
                            controlled about 67 per cent, with the Viet Cong holding only 17 per
                            cent, and the remainder in contested areas.</p>
                        <p>(25) QUESTION: The U.S. has repeatedly said this war must be won by the
                            South Vietnamese. Yet it has became an American war, with many more
                            Americans dying in the war now than Vietnamese. How can you say it is
                            not a U.S. war?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: During the first six months of 1967, the weekly average of South
                            Vietnamese killed in action was 213; of Americans, 188.</p>
                        <p>From June through September, 1967, the weekly average of South Vietnamese
                            killed in action was 172; of Americans, 162.</p>
                        <p>In 1966 a total of 8,679 South Vietnamese were killed in action. During
                            the same period, 7,901 Americans were killed in action.</p>
                        <p>The primary task of the U.S. forces has been to oppose the Viet Cong and
                            North Vietnamese in major military engagements, and to search out and
                            destroy the enemy in his camps and bases. The U.S. has air power to
                            concentrate on this aspect of the war.</p>
                        <p>The South Vietnamese army is concentrating on the defense of villages and
                            hamlets, a task which includes clearing areas of the enemy and holding
                            areas from the enemy. Such engagements are just as deadly, just as
                            bloody as major operations, and perhaps even more difficult than major
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>Some South Vietnamese units are not so tough as they should be, and the
                            South Vietnamese leaders themselves know this. But other units are
                            showing courage and determination. The South Vietnamese soldier’s morale
                            is mounting. Desertions from the South Vietnamese army, once a problem,
                            have greatly decreased. The South Vietnamese soldier has improved
                            markedly since early 1965, when the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese
                            were making military gains. And the South Vietnamese soldier is
                            continuing to show increasing promise as a skillful, effective
                            fighter.</p>
                        <p>(26) QUESTION: What is being done to improve the life of the average
                            South Vietnamese, especially of the peasants?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In the midst of a brutal war, with its demand for tremendous
                            sacrifices and great drain of manpower, the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has been moving ahead—slowly, but with great
                            determination and increasing success—to improve social conditions. The
                            United States and many other nations are giving the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> considerable support in re-building
                            and developing the country.</p>
                        <p><pb n="547" facs="0588" xml:id="pg_547"/>In the past two years, 42,000
                            peasants have been trained in improved farming techniques and animal
                            husbandry. Almost 2,000 new hamlets have been built, providing a haven
                            for some three and one-half million peasants to work the land. The
                            farmers have greatly benefited from the building of 400 kilometers of
                            canals, 100 dikes, 1,200 kilometers of roads. There have been noteworthy
                            improvements in education, with 4,777 classrooms added in 1966 and 1967.
                            Hamlet school teachers are being trained at the rate of 3,500 a year,
                            and a massive textbook program is under way. By mid-1967, more than
                            eight million school books were distributed.</p>
                        <p>Life in secured hamlets is being revitalized by trained teams of South
                            Vietnamese Revolutionary Development (<gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss>) workers who seek to advance the process of nation-building.
                            More than 600 <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss> teams of 59 men each
                            joined the program in 1967, as compared with 450 in 1966, and another
                            800 to 1,000 teams are expected to be added in 1968.</p>
                        <p>(27) QUESTION: Doesn’t the system of land tenure in South Viet-Nam
                            continue to benefit rich landlords, not the poor peasants?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: In the first six months of 1967, under a <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> program of redistributing state-held land, some 12,000
                            farm families had received such land. The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has given 93,000 families permanent titles to some
                            500,000 acres of other land—including squatter lands, former
                            French-owned rice lands, and lands expropriated from landlords. Over
                            900,000 acres remain to be distributed, and the transfer of titles is
                            continuing.</p>
                        <p>Actually, the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> had already begun an
                            enlightened land reform program earlier in the late 1950’s. All
                            French-owned rice lands were expropriated; land holdings were limited to
                            250 acres, and rents to 25 per cent of the principal crop; tenant
                            farmers were given substantial security of tenure. By 1961 a majority of
                            farm families owned at least part of the land they farmed, and rented
                            lands belonged to the small local farmer, not to absentee landlords.
                            Unfortunately, the widespread insecurity of war made it difficult to
                            enforce and re-establish effective administration in various areas.</p>
                        <p>Since 1965, the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> has issued several
                            decrees prohibiting the military from assisting in the collection of
                            back rent, and exempting tenants from paying back rents for periods when
                            the land was under Viet Cong control. There are provisions for providing
                            land for tenants who had been given title illegally by the Viet Cong. In
                            the richest rice-growing area of South Viet-Nam—the Mekong Delta—an
                            aerial survey is under way to clarify the present pattern of land
                            ownership. The survey will enable the government to grant permanent
                            titles much more quickly to farmers who otherwise would have to wait
                            years for a formal ground survey. Meanwhile, data on present land
                            holdings are being collected systematically. The new data will help the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> develop new land policies and
                            to improve existing programs.</p>
                        <p><pb n="548" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_548"/>The <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss>, therefore, fully recognizes that land tenure practices
                            constitute a major rural issue, and is giving high priority to steps to
                            improve the situation.</p>
                        <p>No one denies there are land problems in South Viet-Nam. But they are
                            problems largely caused by the dislocation of war—lack of adequate rural
                            administration, failure to implement existing legislation, inadequate
                            data on land holdings.</p>
                        <p>(28) QUESTION: Are the small farmers gaining any benefit from the various
                            programs?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The farmers themselves, with the help of <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> and U.S. experts, have established their own
                            organizations—the Agricultural Cooperatives, the Farmers’ Association,
                            and the Tenant Farmers Union.</p>
                        <p>These organizations are actively supporting fertilizer and corn-hog
                            programs made possible by the creation of the Agricultural Development
                            Bank, a public institution providing low-interest credits to enable the
                            farmers to use fertilizers and other products to increase their
                            productivity. In 1967 the supply of fertilizers was expected to increase
                            by 50 per cent. The U.S. is supplying 300,000 tons of fertilizer, valued
                            at over $35 million, to this effort. And the <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> is importing over 60,000 tons of feed corn to promote
                            hog production.</p>
                        <p>As hostilities abate, these programs will spread, and the farmers will
                            benefit more and more.</p>
                        <p>(29) QUESTION: How can you justify the deliberate destruction of rice
                            fields and other crops by herbicide spraying? Isn’t this taking food
                            from the mouths of poor farmers and their families, and gaining nothing
                            but hostility?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The destruction of rice fields and other crops impedes the Viet
                            Cong. Crop destruction has taken place only in areas fully controlled by
                            the Viet Cong for a considerable period of time. There the harvested
                            foodstuffs, used solely by the Viet Cong, sustain the attackers in their
                            military operations and their acts of terrorism against innocent
                            civilians. Farmers in areas where crops are to be destroyed are warned
                            in advance and given assistance if they leave such areas and come under
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN_1">GVN</gloss> protection as refugees.</p>
                        <p>(30) QUESTION: In addition to destroying crops, aren’t you also using
                            defoliants over the jungle in Viet-Nam?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The heavy vegetation of many of the jungle and swamp areas in
                            South Viet-Nam provides natural shelter for the Viet Cong guerrillas,
                            and makes it easier for them to move without detection. The RVN has used
                            chemicals against the shelter of natural growth, not against people;
                            against the crops which the Viet Cong grow, not against the guerrillas
                            themselves. The defoliant exposes the lurking marauder—it does not harm
                            him, but makes it harder for him to carry out his destructive
                            mission.</p>
                        <p><pb n="549" facs="0590" xml:id="pg_549"/>Chemical defoliants have been
                            widely used as herbicides, or weed-killers, all over the world for more
                            than 15 years. They are in regular use in such other Asian countries as
                            Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, the Republic of China, Japan, India,
                            Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>Use of herbicides is also widespread in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. On March 5, 1962, then Premier <persName corresp="#p_KNS_1">Khrushchev</persName>, in a report to the Soviet
                            Central Committee, urged that “herbicide production be placed on a wide
                            industrial basis.”</p>
                        <p>(31) QUESTION: Why do you use poison gas against the other side? Don’t
                            you adhere to the Geneva Conventions which prohibit this kind of
                            warfare?</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: Neither the RVN nor any of its allies has used poison gas. Tear
                            gas, which has been used on occasions against the Viet Cong, is neither
                            lethal nor toxic.</p>
                        <p>To force the <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> from tunnels and other
                            hiding places, tear gas is sometimes used. Tear gas is a nontoxic agent
                            which police forces use for riot control in almost every country of the
                            world as a means of limiting violence and casualties. It causes tears
                            and sneezing only; it produces no pain, burn or other harm; its effects
                            last only a few minutes and leave no aftereffects. Its use is not
                            contrary to any Geneva convention.</p>
                        <p>(32) QUESTION: Why are South Vietnamese and American soldiers so brutal
                            or callous toward civilians? I have seen shocking films and photos of
                            their behavior.</p>
                        <p>ANSWER: The task of South Vietnamese troops and their allies is to
                            protect civilians, not brutalize them; to deter the terrorists, not
                            emulate them. But, most regrettably, innocent civilians are sometimes
                            caught in the crossfire and passions of any war.</p>
                        <p>Covering the South Vietnamese side of the war, newsmen and cameramen tend
                            to focus on incidents involving civilians. Such incidents, because they
                            are so infrequent, are especially newsworthy. Viet Cong brutality is
                            less easily covered by foreign correspondents. The <gloss target="#t_VC_1">VC</gloss> make sure that newsmen are not around to
                            witness the terror killing of a <gloss target="#t_RD_2">RD</gloss>
                            worker, or of a district chief and his family. Viet Cong attacks are so
                            numerous that they no longer make dramatic news.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that the South Vietnamese and their allies have provided some
                            two million refugees from the Viet Cong with food, housing, education,
                            training, and medical care. Of those two million, an estimated 1.2
                            million have been successfully resettled within South Viet-Nam even
                            while that country fights for its national life.</p>

                        <p>The Interagency Book Committee has just completed a review of the
                            overseas posts’ responses to the national policy statement on
                            international book and library activities approved by the President last
                                January.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">For text of the national policy
                                statement approved by <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, see the first attachment to <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>One point that recurs in responses from all areas of the world raises a
                            basic policy question which has long been a matter of concern to me.
                            That is the policy which governs the operation of the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries overseas. I recognize that
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has a special mission to
                            perform. I suspect, however, that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s objectives would be better served in the long-run by a
                            broader and less propagandistically oriented library policy. I believe
                            that it is in our national interest to support libraries overseas which
                            give a very broad view of the United States and of its connections to
                            and roots in Western and world civilization.</p>
                        <p>I reiterate this belief at this time because, quite independently of what
                            I think myself, it has been stated by a number of our foreign service
                            officers responsible for book and library programs overseas in their
                            responses to the President’s policy statement. All of them have had a
                            much greater opportunity than I to observe at first-hand the effects of
                            the present narrow and restrictive policy.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy in Laos, for example, suggests that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries should “serve as showcases of the diversity
                            of ideas and of the role of critical commentary in a democratic and free
                            society. It believes that the national policy statement underlines the
                            necessity for eliminating polarized, doctrinaire book-shelf content
                            which robs libraries of their credibility and casts doubt on America’s
                            confidence in free inquiry.”</p>
                        <p><pb n="551" facs="0592" xml:id="pg_551"/>The post in Niger recommends
                            broadening the book selection policy of <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries. Pointing out that the French, British and
                            Italian libraries offer a much broader selection of literary, scientific
                            and other works, it offers this difference in library content as one
                            reason for the notion that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss>
                            peddles propaganda. It suggests that we should stock <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries with the best in American
                            and world literature, and in Africa, furnish a generous supply of books
                            on Africa.</p>
                        <p>The post in Gabon suggests that we would “increase our readership if we
                            were able to offer a higher quantity and quality of books of a purely
                            cultural as opposed to a political ‘propagandistic’ character. This is
                            the policy pursued in the local French Cultural Center where the reader
                            can even find translations of American authors.”</p>
                        <p>The Embassy in Brazil believes that “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries should be showcases of the American library
                            system”, while the Embassy in Belgium states that the most vital service
                            the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> library provides is “the
                            demonstration it offers daily to Belgians in all walks of life, that a
                            free society needs free access to ‘recorded knowledge in all fields of
                            human endeavor’.”</p>
                        <p>One further related point I should like to bring to your attention is the
                            general agreement in the responses of the European posts on the value of
                            having American libraries overseas, the importance of maintaining those
                            now in existence, and the desirability of opening new ones to replace
                            some of those that have been closed.</p>

                                SHOULD BE</p>
                            <p>LAOS: [The post] “suggests that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> should study how <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries can serve as showcases of the diversity

                                libraries of their credibility and casts doubt on America’s
                                confidence in free inquiry. It believes this can be done without
                                endangering our national position vis-à-vis those totalitarian
                                contenders who practice a monolitic approach to libraries. It
                                suggests that the policy <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> now
                                follows in its choice of periodicals, which expose American thought
                                on issues of the day, can serve as a model for book selection
                                policies.”</p>
                            <p>NIGER: “The post recommends broadening the book selection policy of
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries. These
                                libraries are now stocked with certain kinds of books, generally
                                those which are “approved” and which are not controversial.
                                Comparing <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries with
                                libraries supported by France, Great Britain or Italy, many readers
                                are likely to find there a broader selection of literary, scientific
                                and other works of the country which supports the library as well as
                                noteworthy works of other countries, either in translation or in the
                                original. This difference in library content may be one reason for
                                the notion that <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> peddles
                                propaganda. One may well ask whether in most African countries there
                                is a reason to have such comprehensive libraries, since only a
                                fraction of the population reads and writes. One answer could be
                                that this fraction contains the intellectual elite on whom political
                                leaders, some of whom may also be intellectuals, will rely to do the
                                work in the government, in education, in economic planning, etc.
                                Since these are primary target audiences, we should want them to
                                find books of real interest to them in our libraries. Once people
                                find in a library the things for which they are looking, they
                                eventually may get around to the books which we would like them to
                                read. Therefore, we should stock <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries with the best in American and world
                                literature. In Africa we should furnish our libraries with a
                                generous supply of books on Africa. . . .”</p>
                            <p>KENYA: “If [<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries] are to
                                be models of today’s library service, emphasis will have to be
                                placed on having an American library staff. Reference collections
                                should be stressed, book collections widened and made more balanced,
                                up-to-date techniques employed and appearances modernized. These
                                factors are important for . . . our country continues to be regarded
                                as the most modern in the world, and our libraries should reflect
                                the modern concept of library service.”</p>
                            <p>GABON: “Even if one aim of our international book and library
                                program, namely the promotion of readership in England, can hope to
                                have only very limited success, this should not discourage us from
                                pursuing our main objective, which should be the development in
                                francophone areas of a readership for American authors and an
                                appreciation for American values and techniques. . . . Important
                                [for this] is the provision of adequate French translations of the
                                latest publications in the world of American fiction and
                                non-fiction. We would increase our readership if we were able to
                                offer a higher quantity and quality <pb n="553" facs="0594" xml:id="pg_553"/>of books of a purely cultural as opposed to a
                                political “propagandistic” character. This is the policy pursued in
                                the local French Cultural Center where the reader can even find
                                translations of American authors.”</p>
                            <p>BRAZIL: “<gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> libraries should be
                                showcases of the American library system and should provide the best
                                of reference and technical service.”</p>
                            <p>BELGIUM: “The <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> Lincoln
                                Library’s most important contribution to [national book and library
                                policy] objectives lies in the fact of its existence, as an example
                                of American library science on foreign soil. For, in functioning as
                                an American library, it has something profound to say about
                                democracy and about the free access to information in a democratic
                                society. . . . The most vital service [it] provides in terms of the
                                [policy] objectives is the demonstration it offers daily to Belgians
                                of all walks of life: that a free society needs free access to
                                ‘recorded knowledge in all fields of human endeavor.’”</p>
                            <p>SWEDEN: “It remains our opinion, often expressed through the years,
                                that books are basic to our country’s information program here, and
                                that the American library remains the exemplary and tangible symbol
                                of a free and open society which places value on fact, enlightened
                                opinion and free discussion.”</p>
                            <p>FRANCE: “It is in the area of providing libraries where French
                                students and others could enjoy maximum access to the best books on
                                American civilization . . . that <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> has made a major effort in the past. This effort
                                was substantially curtailed between 1963 and 1966 because of budget
                                cuts, and can only be restored through increased budget allocations.
                                . . . Ideally, there should be an American library in each
                                university center, staffed by American and French personnel. . . .
                                More realistically, depending on funds, one or more such libraries
                                could be established by <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> in
                                the highest priority university cities. . . . Should funds and
                                personnel essential for opening new branch libraries be available,
                                the Post could develop an order of priority . . . and could

                                This is plainly short-sighted, for Spain is at a stage when the flow
                                of current reliable information and contemporary scholarship is
                                essential to the growing, discontented generation. The Post is sadly

                                represented by the study and information centers. It is very
                                difficult to explain to young Spaniards, or to anyone, that the U.S.

                            during my term of office. Instead of the usual complaint of inefficiency
                            and ineffectiveness, the Committee demands that a greater emphasis be
                            placed on the information program through larger appropriations and a
                            more prominent role for the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in
                            determining foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>2. The only serious charge in the document relates to the failure of your
                            Administration to recognize the importance of the Government’s
                            information program in foreign affairs. It states:</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the fact that you were Chairman of the Senate
                            Appropriations Committee in 1957 when the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> budget was drastically reduced “because of a failure

                            that your Administration has not followed the Eisenhower doctrine, has
                            subordinated the role of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> in
                            foreign affairs, and as a result U.S. prestige abroad has declined.</p>

                            the Committee deplores their inability to justify their charge by
                            reference to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> material. However,
                            the Republican National Committee undertook its own private polls last

                            conferences of leaders and experts throughout the world. Since February
                            1966, <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> posts around the world have
                            organized some 590 seminars, bringing together leading American experts
                            with top-ranking leaders in foreign countries. These seminars have all
                            been of at least one day’s duration and many of them have been as long
                            as two weeks. All have been directed to highly specialized groups. In
                            addition to these seminars, many lectures and conferences have been held
                            all over the world.</p>
                        <p>The seminar technique has proved to be a highly useful one to convey our
                            message and also an effective technique to bring together leading
                            educators. In the European area some 150 seminars were organized in
                            1966. This increased to 180 in 1967 and it is contemplated that some 200
                            seminars will be held in 1968.</p>
                        <p>In Africa it has been found that individual lectures and informal
                            discussions are still the most useful techniques and have proved to be
                            effective methods of promoting international education and
                            understanding. Fifty-nine seminars were held in 1966 and 1967, and many
                            lectures and meetings of experts were sponsored.</p>

                            BOOKS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS:</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to the President’s Initiative, the United States Information
                            Agency has taken several steps to increase the flow of books and other
                            educational material abroad. A program to refurbish information centers
                            and to make these centers and libraries more attractive is in process
                            and is serving to increase attendance and use of books and magazines.
                            Exhibits such as “The World of Paperbacks” have been circulated to
                            universities, information centers, book fairs, and binational centers to
                            expand the interest and readership of books. The circulation of these
                            book exhibits has also spurred the commercial market for American
                            publications.</p>
                        <p>There has been a significant increase in the last two years in the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Donated Book Program. In <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1965 <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> sent 1.37 million books abroad under this program.
                            This increased to 1.88 million copies in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1966 and to 1.94 million in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1967. At the present moment there are more than 3.5
                            million titles being processed for shipment overseas.</p>
                        <p>Recently there has been a significant increase in the number of American
                            titles which have been published abroad by commercial publishers. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> encourages foreign publishers to
                            print American books as part of their own commercial activities by
                            suggesting titles, assisting in the obtaining of copyright privileges,
                            advising on distribution and facilitating production. The substantial
                            increase in American Studies at foreign universities, a program which
                            has had an impetus from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>, will
                            create an additional commercial demand for American book titles.</p>
                        <p>The United States is now a member of both the Beirut and the Florence
                            Agreements which grant duty free entry of audio visual and educational
                            materials respectively.<note n="4" xml:id="d175fn4">See <ref target="#d113fn3">footnote 3, Document 113</ref>.</note> Already
                            there has been an increased flow in these items and it is fully expected

                            has significantly increased its efforts to target English teaching

                                offensive would have two more phases in May and August. Although
                                suffering serious casualties, the military forces of the United
                                States and South Vietnam were able to respond to and effectively
                                repel the North Vietnamese and <gloss target="#t_NLF_1">NLF</gloss>
                                forces and regain control of the parts of South Vietnam they had
                                initially lost. According to a <hi rend="italic">Christian Science
                                    Monitor</hi> article published on January 30: “Most Europeans
                                used to consider themselves good friends of the United States, and
                                the feeling was mutual. But recently primarily because of the
                                Vietnam conflict, the American image in Europe has become severely
                                tarnished.” (Barry Edgar, “Opinionmakers Sought: How <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> reaches the Danes,” <hi rend="italic">Christian Science Monitor</hi>, January 30, 1968,
                                p. 4)</note> In reviewing reports from our missions, I came to the
                            following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>1. The demonstrations and public outrages appear to be the work of
                            professional anti-Americans who have been on the European scene for the
                            past two decades. They will continue to hate America, if not for
                            Viet-Nam, then for some other reason. It also appears that they have
                            clear associations with Communist organizations and accept the “line
                            from Moscow.”</p>
                        <p>2. Europeans are generally puzzled as to what is happening in Viet-Nam
                            and show a great anxiety that the war there may have some detrimental
                            effect in our relationships with Europe. They constantly ask, “How and
                            when is the war going to end?”</p>
                        <p>3. As part of this background, I want to quote from a recent report from
                            one of our officers:</p>
                        <quote><p>“European scholars who are sympathetic to the U.S. position in
                                Viet-Nam told me that there is a terrible tyranny being enforced on
                                academics in Europe, especially in Sweden, Italy and Britain. Their
                                    <pb n="562" facs="0603" xml:id="pg_562"/>complaint seemed to be
                                that the anti-Viet-Nam forces control the universities, which means
                                they control faculty appointments, promotions, decisions on
                                publishing, etc., and thus can and do bring great pressures to bear
                                on what they consider the deviants, those not totally hostile to
                                U.S. and Viet-Nam, including scholars who seek simply to maintain
                                scholarly objectivity.</p>
                            <p>“One of the knottiest problems to handle are Europeans of good will
                                and open mind who ask about anti-Viet-Nam statements by prominent
                                Americans, Lippmann, <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KRF_1">Robert
                                    Kennedy</persName>, etc., U.S. television footage. We are
                                undoubtedly our own worst enemy in Europe.”</p></quote>
                        <p>4. One can discuss our participation in Viet-Nam on three levels:</p>
                        <p>A. The factual level—A discussion of the historical background, how we
                            got there and what we are doing there today, militarily and
                            economically.</p>
                        <p>B. The policy level—What the U.S. is trying to do in Viet-Nam and its
                            broader meanings to Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>C. The opinion level—This involves a discussion of moral judgments in
                            abstract terms such as idealism.</p>
                        <p>A discussion on the “factual” or “policy level” can be productive with
                            reasonably fair-minded audiences. A discuss on the “opinion level” is
                            rarely productive and quickly becomes a debate in which “heat” rather
                            than “light” is generated.</p>
                        <p>Our Missions note that the questions most frequently raised are:</p>
                        <p>1. Why can’t the war be brought to a rapid conclusion in view of the
                            great power and strength of the U.S.?</p>
                        <p>2. What are the Viet Cong fighting for? What do they want? Why do they
                            continue to fight? What would they settle for?</p>
                        <p>3. What difference does it make to the U.S. in terms of its national
                            interest? What happens in this small distant country?</p>
                        <p>4. Why is there so much hostility to the war among so many prominent
                            scholars, community and political figures, particularly in the U.S.?</p>
                        <p>5. What would the U.S. actually settle for?</p>
                        <p>6. Is the war in Viet-Nam going to be the principle issue in the 1968
                            Presidential elections?<note n="3" xml:id="d176fn3">The U.S.
                                Presidential election was November 5.</note></p>
                        <p>Our output has addressed itself to these questions and our Missions have
                            been instructed to anticipate these concerns in all seminars and
                            face-to-face meetings. Reasonable progress is being reported.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Finally, throughout the reports from our officers in
                                Europe is the plea that “more Vietnamese ought to be telling the

                                accusations of rather extended corruption in the South Vietnamese
                                government—and that these conditions are a rather important key to
                                the ability of the South Vietnamese government to mould a national
                                society. I was wondering what the U.S. Government has done in the
                                past weeks or so to react to these accusations, and also if this
                                South Vietnamese government is not going to respond to correct these
                                conditions, if we will continue our commitment to that nation?</p>

                                not exactly a monopoly of Southeast Asia, or of Viet-Nam. I don’t
                                want to make any invidious comparisons, but there are a few cities
                                in the United States that could teach the South Vietnamese some
                                lessons in how to operate corrupt government, and I think we might
                                spend a little time cleaning our own stables before we start
                                lecturing, piously lecturing a goodly number of other people.</p>

                                world, picking out people that you’re going to do business with, and
                                with whom you have alliances and allegiance, on the basis of whether
                                or not they meet puritanical standards, you’re going to find
                                yourself with very, very few friends. As a matter of fact, there may
                                be a few of them that’ll leave us, because we have a little problem
                                here every once in a while. We even have to appoint committees in
                                the Congress on ethics.</p>
                            <p>So let’s not try to pretend that corruption is a monopoly of any
                                particular people or country. Now, the next thing. We wanted—for a
                                    <pb n="565" facs="0606" xml:id="pg_565"/>period of time there
                                was a great deal of criticism because the government in South
                                Viet-Nam was a military junta. So we insisted, as an ally, and
                                encouraged as an ally, the development of representative government
                                institutions, and with all if its limitations, the people of South
                                Viet-Nam did elect a Constituent Assembly, and my fellow American,
                                we never did. Our Constitution was not written by elected officials.
                                That Constituent Assembly did write a Constitution, despite the fact
                                that most of the critics said they never would, and it wrote it in
                                the open light of day without any censorship; ours was not.<note n="6" xml:id="d177fn6">The Vietnamese Constitution was
                                    promulgated in April 1967. See <ref target="#d127fn2">footnote

                                were doing in Philadelphia, we never would have had a Constitution;
                                everybody knew that.</p>
                            <p>Now, those of us that are students of history and government ought to
                                start leveling with the American people. A Constitution was written
                                and it was adopted, and elections were held. Now, it’s no small task
                                to have an election in a country that’s beleagured by guerrilla
                                warfare, but they held it.<note n="7" xml:id="d177fn7">The
                                    Presidential election in South Vietnam took place September 3,
                                    1967.</note> There were very few elections in World War II, in
                                the Allied countries that were under attack; I don’t recall any. As
                                a matter of fact, it’s rather unusual. Now, a government has been
                                elected. Now it may not be so good, but some people don’t think ours
                                is so good. There’s a substantial portion of the American public
                                that thinks they ought to change here too. And they accuse us of all
                                kinds of things. Now, that government is their government; it may
                                not be as good as I’d like, but we insisted that they have one that
                                was elected. Now the fact of the matter is that there is a need for
                                progress as we see it in the government in Viet-Nam, and we do press
                                for it. But they are not a satellite. On the one hand, if we took
                                them and bent them to our will, somebody would say “Now, that’s the
                                total Americanization, not only of the war, but of the
                                government.”</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, if we don’t bend them to our will, we’re
                                criticized because we don’t exercise our influence. So what do we
                                try to do? We try to reason; I think one of the most impressive men
                                in American public life, in my lifetime, is Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, and one of the things I’d
                                like to leave with you students is that this man has been respected
                                in university circles, in church circles, in political circles, and
                                professional circles, for at least forty years. He’s a tremendous
                                person. Now when did he get to be so bad? I mean, here is the same
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> that was a
                                United Nations representative, an Ambassador to Italy, an Ambassador

                                    Ambassador to India from November 1956 until March 1961. He

                                he goes to Viet-Nam and all at once you can’t believe him; all at
                                once he’s ineffective. All at once he isn’t telling us the truth,
                                according to some people. I don’t agree with that at all; I think
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> is doing a
                                magnificent job representing the people of the United States, and if
                                any man wants decency in government, if I know him, and I know him
                                well. I served in the U.N. with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>; I know of no more moral man
                                in this world than Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. I know of no more effective man in diplomacy
                                than Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. I
                                think he’s doing everything that can be done to influence people to
                                do what is right. In the meantime, it is an elected government, and
                                that’s some accomplishment. By the way, has anybody made a report on
                                the corruption in North Viet-Nam? When did they have an
                                election?</p>
                            <p>Q. Mr. Vice President, the real question seems to be the—not so much
                                the fact that there is corruption, which I’m willing to agree to,
                                not only in South Viet-Nam but anywhere, but what if, in light of
                                this, the continued problems that the South Vietnamese government
                                continues to face, within its own structure, that it collapses, what
                                will then be our position? Is this not a possibility?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Vice President:</hi> Well, my good friend,
                                there are always possibilities, but there’s been no evidence that
                                it’s going to collapse. As a matter of fact, this is what people
                                have been predicting all along. The predictions about this country
                                have been unbelievable. First of all, some people predicted in the
                                Congress that the elections would be a hoax and a fraud. They
                                weren’t. Some people predicted that the junta would never permit a
                                Constitution to come into being, but they did. Some people said that
                                Thieu and Ky and the Assembly would never respond to constitutional
                                government, but they have. And now we are saying it’ll most likely
                                collapse, and it hasn’t, and it has gone through the most terrible
                                blood bath in recent days that any country could possibly face, and
                                what’s been the result? Thus far, the government is holding its own;
                                thus far, not a single unit of the South Vietnamese Army has
                                defected, not one. Thus far, the National Assembly meets and
                                debates. I haven’t heard of any reports of a National Assembly
                                debating up in Hanoi. I think we are—ought to be praising these
                                people for their efforts in trying to make constitutional government
                                work.</p>
                            <p><pb n="567" facs="0608" xml:id="pg_567"/>It isn’t that it’s perfect;
                                it’s not very perfect here. We’ve been trying to get a tax bill out
                                of committee in this country for a year and a half. Can’t even get
                                it out of subcommittee. I don’t think that we’ve got too much to
                                brag about sometimes, when we’re criticizing others. All I’m saying
                                is, don’t sell them out before the facts. The truth of the matter is
                                that they’ve done better than most of their critics ever thought
                                they would do. We hope they’ll do better; we encourage them to do
                                better. But I learned a long time ago that if you constantly brand a
                                fellow as a failure, if you are suspicious as to whether or not he
                                can ever do anything, you can rest assured that most people will
                                react just about the way you treat them, and if you treat them like
                                losers, they’ll start acting that way. If you treat them as if
                                they’re unwanted, they’ll act that way, but if you give them some
                                sense of confidence, and at the same time encourage and persuade and
                                cajole and try to instruct, you may get a better system. And I think
                                that’s what we’re doing. I think we have a right to be somewhat
                                encouraged at what we’ve seen.</p>
                            <p>Q. Mr. Vice President, positions regarding U.S. involvement in
                                Viet-Nam are widely disparate, even among the most respected public
                                officials and figures in the United States. Do you interpret this as
                                simply misinformation, or maybe differences of opinion, or is it
                                misinterpretation of facts, or just is it misinformation?</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Vice President:</hi> I think it’s a compound of
                                all of those. This is the first—maybe I can be helpful on this.</p>
                            <p>First of all, I don’t think that people that disagree with us are
                                unpatriotic. I want to make that quite clear. This is a very complex
                                situation. This is an entirely different kind of struggle than this
                                country has ever been engaged in before. This is the first war in
                                the nation’s history that has been fought without conditions of
                                censorship. This is the first war in the nation’s history that’s
                                been fought on television, where the actors are real, where, in the
                                quiet of your living room, of your home, or your dormitory, wherever
                                you may be, this cruel, ugly, dirty fact of life and death and war
                                and pain and suffering come right to you, and it isn’t a Hollywood
                                actor. I’ve had letters from mothers that have seen their boys shot
                                down in battle, and let me tell you that I think that television is
                                the most—well, it’s the most dramatic instrument of our time. That
                                tube, for either good or evil, and thank goodness we can use it now
                                at least in dialogue, which I think is the way it ought to be used.
                                At least in part. It can be a great educational instrument.</p>
                            <p>There are so many different views about—even whether we should be
                                there, whether our national interest is involved, whether a treaty
                                ought to be fulfilled. Whether we should have ever signed a treaty;
                                there are a lot of—well, many people feel that we made mistakes, and
                                we really are over-involved. There are people that honestly feel
                                that <pb n="568" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_568"/>way. I happen to be
                                one of those, sir, that believes that you can’t relive the past. I
                                also happen to be one that believes that the greatest protection of
                                peace in this world today is the integrity of the American word or
                                commitment. Now maybe we shouldn’t give our word as often as we do,
                                or our commitment; but when we do, it is imperative that we mean
                                what we say, and I can say for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> and Vice President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>, we signed no
                                new treaties in the years that we’ve been in power. One treaty that

                            <p>But going back to your question, sir. I, as a government official,
                                must place a great deal of reliance upon what we call our
                                intelligence sources. I do not place total reliance upon them; I
                                know there are newsmen in Viet-Nam for whom I have great respect,
                                that differ with these intelligence observations, but might I say
                                that it’s pretty much like the domestic scene. Some of us get a
                                fixation, or get a fixed point of view on a particular development
                                and do not see the totality of it. For example, if you wanted to
                                talk with me about politics, domestic politics, let’s say two or
                                three years ago, I most likely would have concentrated most of my
                                attention upon that area which I knew the better, which is my home
                                state of Minnesota, and I’d get into intricate details about it
                                which would be rather baffling both to the viewer, the listener, and
                                even to the propounder.</p>
                            <p>But when you take a bigger view of the nation, you don’t have time
                                for all of that little detail, and your observations become more
                                generalized, and in a sense, I think, more meaningful. I think this
                                is part of the trouble in Viet-Nam. For example, most of our
                                reporters, and they’re good reporters, they follow American troops.
                                They like to live with the American troops; they speak the language,
                                they like the food, they like the fellows. It’s their life; they
                                don’t go with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss>
                                <pb n="569" facs="0610" xml:id="pg_569"/>troops, only once in a
                                while. And generally the time that they observe the <gloss target="#t_ARVN_1">ARVN</gloss> troops is when they—when they
                                lose, when they’re in trouble.</p>
                            <p>Now, within recent weeks, because of the nature of the Tet offensive
                                from the Viet Cong and North Viet-Nam, and because about ninety
                                percent of the troops that are engaged on the Allies side are South
                                Vietnamese troops, not American but South Vietnamese, the reporters
                                have, by necessity, if they were going to cover anything and because
                                much of the fighting was in Saigon, where the reporters remain, they
                                had to cover South Vietnamese operations. Now the fact of the matter
                                is, the South Vietnamese have fought bravely, very bravely, and they
                                have fought well, and these are the same troops that they were
                                calling no good just a few weeks ago. The fact that the war was
                                brought to Saigon, my friend, I think has changed a great deal of
                                reporting on the war, and I noticed over the weekend that even from
                                Paris, the observers in Paris that have been very critical of us now
                                seem to come pretty much to the conclusion that some of us had about
                                the nature of this recent Tet offensive and what its purpose was.
                                They now agree, all the capitals around the world now seem to agree
                                that the Viet Cong were out to take the cities, to establish what
                                they called revolutionary administrations, to force upon Saigon a
                                coalition government, to depose Thieu and Ky, and to really have a
                                fait accompli, and tell the Americans “If you want to negotiate,
                                you’re going to negotiate with us or get out.” It didn’t work. They
                                didn’t get a popular uprising; they didn’t get mass defection of
                                troops. They don’t hold a single city today; they hold a part of
                                Hue, and a small part of a suburb in Saigon. They had terrific
                                losses. I speak of the enemy. Obviously there have been some
                                negative aspects; the pacification program has been brought to a
                                stand-still. I still think the enemy has the strength to launch a
                                very serious attack; I don’t know what the ultimate outcome of all
                                this is going to be. I think you’ll have to wait for events to speak
                                louder than newspaper reports, but you see, it’s the complexity of a
                                guerrilla war; it’s the complexity, too, of this culture, that we’re
                                so unfamiliar with. And I think that this is why that there’s so
                                much what you call in different interpretations. I think it is
                                wrong, however, for us to assume that there is a kind of malice on
                                the part of some. I think really what happens is people just see it
                                differently.</p>
                            <p>Q. When the bombing was first started, we said it was to bring the
                                Vietnamese to the conference table, and then later we said it was to
                                keep the guerrilla warfare down. Exactly what is the stated policy
                                now for the bombing, since obviously the other two haven’t
                                worked?</p>

                                it will lead to prompt and productive talks, provided that the
                                assumption is that there will be no escalation or no taking
                                advantage of this type of a negotiating stance. We are prepared, my
                                dear lady, right now, to accept immediate cease-fire. We are really
                                prepared to have what we call immediate stand-down, with every bit
                                of the troops standing as they are, and to enter negotiation. The
                                roadblock to peace is not in Washington. I can tell you that my dear
                                lady; the roadblock to peace is not here. The roadblock to peace,
                                regrettably, is in Hanoi. We are prepared as of this moment, I say
                                as Vice President of the United States, to have immediate
                                negotiations for the cessation of this struggle; immediate

                        <p>From previous letters you know my own views on the importance of our
                            long-range cultural programs. Here are some recent initiatives:</p>
                        <p>1. The first issue of the new cultural quarterly, <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi>, is now reaching the field. I hope that you will find
                            it a lively, stimulating presentation of the intellectual vigor and
                            creativity of American society today.</p>
                        <p>2. Now at press is “Creative America” by Howard Taubman, Art and Cultural
                            critic of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times.</hi> It introduces a
                            series of nine pamphlets on the arts.</p>
                        <p>3. In the film medium we are seeking to communicate the spirit, variety
                            and quality of American life through a number of color documentaries for
                            commercial distribution. “Airport” and “The Golden Gate” are the
                            first.</p>
                        <p>4. New initiatives in the book field offer excellent opportunities for
                            strengthening our cultural programs. Post responses to the <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USA_1">USA</gloss> in Books</hi>

                            been developed into a major resource for filling the needs of libraries
                            and institutions abroad. Make sure that your staffs are familiar with

                        <p>You will soon be hearing about <gloss target="#t_ICS_1">ICS</gloss>’ new
                            Educational Support Branch and its plans to strengthen Agency support
                            for your activities with educational institutions abroad. Another new
                            development is the concept of “package programs” for cultural centers,
                            combining the resources of several media to project principal themes
                            about American life. I also call to your attention the Information
                            Center Guidance (<gloss target="#t_CA_1">CA</gloss>–<pb n="572" facs="0613" xml:id="pg_572"/>1747 of February 5, 1968) which
                            outlines the role of the Center in achieving <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s long-range goals.<note n="4" xml:id="d178fn4">Not

                        <p>Obviously, it is essential that we keep abreast of technical changes in
                            the communications field. We must take advantage of new ways to improve
                            our distribution through the printed and electronic media. Accordingly,
                            we have watched carefully the developments in
                            “microforms”—miniaturization of the printed word. For example, one
                            process has reduced the entire Holy Bible to a slide measuring 2 inches
                            by 2 inches. A sample is attached.<note n="5" xml:id="d178fn5">Not found
                                attached.</note> If this process becomes commercially feasible, we
                            may be able vastly to expand our library holdings.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, in the electronic field, there will shortly be introduced
                            “Electronic Video Recording” which will permit the presentation of a
                            film through a television set. We are developing a sample one-hour film
                            for test purposes and hope to have it available before the end of the
                            year.</p>
                        <p>You can see that there are exciting new prospects ahead which will
                            challenge our ingenuity and open vast new horizons for our Information
                            Centers and for local institutions.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the new approaches we are exploring in Washington. They
                            are based as far as possible on our understanding of your needs, through
                            first-hand observation by the Area Assistant Directors and through your
                            reports. But I am eager to hear more of your ideas about how we can
                            strengthen our cultural programs, what we should be saying and how we
                            should be saying it.</p>
                        <p>Each month we are improving the Agency’s world-wide system of
                            communication. Yet no system, no matter how modern, efficient and rapid,
                            is better than the ideas it transmits. We need imaginative thinking from
                            all our staff, and particularly from you in the field who know best what
                            will be most meaningful to our audiences.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy reading your responses to these letters. Please feel free to
                            write whenever you have a suggestion.</p>

                        <p>From now until the summer of 1968 is over we can expect constant
                            headlines about the urban crisis, and the problems arising from
                            Negro-white relations, in the United States.</p>
                        <p>There are at least four focal points of attention which have been, and
                            will continue to be, widely publicized in the United States. The foreign
                            press will probably devote considerable attention to them, especially
                            when they generate events with high dramatic impact. Those focal points
                            are:</p>

                                was also referred to as the “Kerner Commission,” named after its
                                chairman, Illinois Governor Otto Kerner.</note></p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> appointed this
                            Commission on July 29, 1967, to find the causes of urban riots in the
                            U.S., and to recommend solutions. The Commission made public its
                            1,485-page report on March 2, 1968.</p>
                        <p>The hard-hitting report made national headlines, and is receiving
                            international attention, because of its uncompromising language and its
                            concentration on problems that remain unsolved in the Negro centers of
                            American cities where riots occurred in 1967.<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">See, for example, William Kling, “Why, What, When

                        <p>The report emphasized the following basic causes for the riots: white
                            racism, which led to Negro belligerence; pervasive anti-Negro
                            discrimination and segregation; massive and growing concentration of
                            impoverished Negroes in the city centers, caused by a combination of
                            high birth rate among urban Negroes, white exodus from cities, and Negro
                            immigration from the rural American south; frustrated hopes of the poor
                            and the jobless in city slums; the feeling of powerlessness among many
                            Negro Americans, manifested in various “black power” movements.</p>
                        <p>The report contains a long series of recommendations for action, much of

                        <p>Various “black power” groups have been agitating for months among Negro
                            American athletes, urging a boycott of the Olympics in Mexico. This
                            effort will probably be heightened because of the International Olympic
                            Committee’s recent readmission of South Africa to the Olympic Games and
                            the subsequent declaration of many African nations that they intend to
                            withdraw from the games. The campaign will probably intensify as the
                            date of the games draws near. If this coincides with summer rioting, the
                            campaign could have a strong negative effect abroad.</p>

                        <p>There is already considerable speculation in the media, both at home and
                            overseas, about the possibility of riots in the U.S. this summer. The
                            elements which led to riots in 1967 are still present—the crowded slums,
                            high unemployment among Negro youths who are in the forefront of the
                            rioters, Negro resentment of whites fanned by a growing number of “black
                            power” groups, white fear of Negro violence.<note n="9" xml:id="d179fn9">See <ref target="#d158">Document 158</ref>.</note></p>

                        <p>Riots, boycotts and demonstrations in the U.S. make headlines. The
                            steady, day-to-day progress in American race relations on many fronts
                            does not. Without denying the serious situation in American cities, we
                            seek to place the crisis in the context of continuing progress toward
                            eliminating its causes. We must heighten foreign awareness of important
                            constructive development demonstrating the sustained efforts of the
                            President, many members of Congress, and diverse elements of American

                        <p>We should:</p>

                            the Commission on Civil Disorders was personally appointed by the
                            President to make recommendations on America’s greatest item of
                            unfinished domestic business, the racial-urban crisis. He did not ask
                            for a whitewash, or for praise of progress made so far. He asked for the
                            hard facts about the crisis, and the Commission reported them (see ANNEX

                        <quote><p>“Today, America’s cities are in crisis. This clear and urgent
                                warning rises from the decay of decades—and is amplified by the
                                harsh realities of the present.”</p></quote>
                        <p>Draw on the latter message for the specific programs he recommended. In
                            addition to programs already in effect (job training, Job Corps, Head
                            Start, VISTA, Community Action, aid to education, and others), the
                            President is pressing hard for new programs (expanded low-cost housing,
                            model cities) which will improve life in the troubled American cities.
                            The report of the Commission on Civil Disorders supports, repeats, and
                            expands many of the President’s recommendations to Congress on housing,
                            employment and urban development. That report may help to muster support
                            for his programs to ease the urban and racial crisis.</p>
                        <p>(3) Acquaint audiences with the magnitude and complexity of the task of
                            absorbing into the mainstream of American urban life the millions of
                            unprepared, undereducated Negro Americans from the rural south who have
                            migrated to the cities in recent years. Make audiences aware of the
                            crushing demand this migration has made on the cities for housing,
                            education and jobs. The Commission’s report cites the following figures:
                            About 3.5 million Negroes migrated from the south <pb n="577" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_577"/>to northern cities during the past 25
                            years; the percentage of Negroes in the central cities rose from 12 per
                            cent in 1950 to 17 per cent in 1960, to 20 per cent in 1966, and it is
                            still rising; since 1960, Negro population has doubled in six major
                            cites.</p>
                        <p>(4) Point out that Negro protests today are stimulated to a large degree
                            by the revolution of rising expectations which many Negro Americans have
                            experienced; that the successful integration of large numbers of Negroes
                            into the political, economic and cultural life of the nation has
                            intensified the despair and frustration of the millions of untrained,
                            poorly educated Negroes who remain in the urban slums; and that “Great
                            Society” programs—of education, job training and placement, and
                            community action—are designed to give Negroes and others who are below
                            the poverty line increasing opportunity to participate fully in American
                            life.</p>
                        <p>(5) Place in historical and worldwide context the civil rights revolution
                            and the fight against discrimination in the U.S. Minorities exist
                            throughout the world; securing equality for them is a worldwide problem.
                            The U.S., a veritable nation of minorities, has probably made as much
                            progress as any nation in solving the problems of its minorities. It now
                            faces the most critical minority problem in its history—the need to
                            eliminate deep damage caused by centuries of slavery, segregation,
                            discrimination, and prejudice; and to help the Negro minority achieve
                            the higher living standards of the rest of the nation. (See ANNEX for
                            pertinent excerpts from a March 4, 1968, speech by Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>(6) Without denying that racial prejudices and shibboleths exacerbate the
                            problem of adjusting rural and unskilled migrants to American city life,
                            seek to show that the migrants’ difficulties and discontents are
                            comparable to those of new urbanites throughout the world who have
                            migrated to cities faster than jobs have been created there.</p>
                        <p>(7) Remind audiences that the President and the entire Executive Branch
                            are committed, without reservation, to the elimination of discrimination
                            and segregation from American life; that many recent developments show
                            the will of important, diverse segments of the American majority to
                            eliminate slums and improve substandard conditions. Among such
                            developments:</p>

                        <p>The looting and burning in American cities following the assassination of
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">Martin Luther King</persName> drew
                            sensational headlines and lurid press accounts in news centers around
                            the world. Heavy news treatment pictured the U.S. in racial turmoil,
                            with some papers saying the country was on the brink of civil war.</p>
                        <p>Headlines and pictures played up the deployment of Federal troops in
                            “riot-torn cities.”</p>
                        <p>Voluminous editorial comment expressed shock and sorrow at the murder of
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">King</persName> and apprehension that
                            with the loss of his voice of moderation, more militant forces would
                            come to the fore.</p>
                        <p>Typical comments were:</p>
                        <quote><p>“In Moscow, <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> said: ‘The fatal gun

                                was aimed by the same America which is bringing death in Viet-Nam
                                with tens of thousands of bullets. This is the America of the oil
                                magnates, automobile kings, and Pentagon brasshats. . . . But the

                            <p>“Havana radio carried a telephone interview with Stokely Carmichael,
                                quoting him as saying: ‘we’ve gone full swing into the revolution. .
                                . . More people are now beginning to plan seriously a major urban

                        <p>It was quite apparent that the events of the past week have seriously

                        <p>B. That the Negroes and whites cooperated in every community to repair

                        <p>C. Great progress has been made in civil rights during your
                            Administration—you have appointed Negroes to your Cabinet, the Supreme

                            community. These themes will be stressed for a substantial period of

                            <salute>Dear <gloss target="#t_PAO_1">PAO</gloss>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>The kaleidoscopic events of the past two weeks have, I know, placed
                            exceptional demands upon you in the field as they have upon us in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>I want first to reiterate to you what I have told the staff here: that I
                            plan to continue as <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> Director
                            through the President’s term of office.<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">Reference is to the President’s March 31 speech; see <ref target="#d182fn2">footnote 2, Document 182</ref>.</note> I look
                            forward to the coming nine months as a time when we shall move ahead on
                            many important projects already under way and, I hope, initiate some new
                            ones as well.</p>
                        <p>As the election campaign proceeds, it presents both problems and
                            opportunities for us. The problems are evident: we must in our output
                            give a balanced, impartial presentation of the campaign, the issues and
                            the candidates, scrupulously avoiding any impression of partisanship. We
                            must also help our foreign audiences see the campaign in perspective,
                            last they be misled by the traditional campaign oratory to overestimate
                            the divisions in America or to magnify the problems, both domestic and
                            international, that will be thoroughly aired before the world. I am
                            confident that our seasoned staffs will meet both of these
                            challenges.</p>
                        <p>We should remember, too, that the campaign offers us unique
                            opportunities. We canict the processes of the American political system
                            and thereby build confidence in American democracy. We can show that
                            responsible dissent and political conflict in a free society are signs
                            of strength, not weakness; we can stress the grassroots character of
                            U.S. political activity and the manner in which our citizens relate
                            themselves to their government; and we can demonstrate how our nation
                            closes ranks after election day and prepares for the orderly transition
                            of power—the culminating act of the democratic process.</p>
                        <p>The tragic death of <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">Martin Luther
                                King</persName> and the repercussions that followed shocked us all
                            as Americans. They also brought in their wake special problems for the
                            United States abroad. I have followed the <pb n="586" facs="0627" xml:id="pg_586"/>overseas reaction closely and realize the questions
                            and attitudes that your audiences are expressing. I see our task here as
                            an excellent illustration of the role of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. We must give a balanced accounting which involves
                            both a debit and an asset side of the ledger. Since what reaches our
                            foreign audience at a time such as this is apt to be heavily weighted on
                            the negative side, we have a special obligation to present the often
                            overlooked factors that put the situation in full perspective.</p>
                        <p>During the past week, our media fulfilled this obligation admirably.
                            While in no way minimizing the problems that the United States faced in
                            its cities in the days following the death of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KML_1">King</persName>, the media made clear that only a
                            very small proportion of Negro Americans were involved in the disorders;
                            that violence was confined to small pockets of large cities; and that
                            the overwhelming majority of Americans, whatever the color of their
                            skins, demonstrated their respect for law and order.</p>
                        <p>Finally I want to report to you that last week I testified before
                            committees of the House on both our appropriations and our career
                                legislation.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">See <ref target="#d183fn4">footnote 4</ref> below.</note></p>
                        <p>The House Appropriations Committee was extremely courteous and quite
                            considerate in reviewing our budget requests. I am indeed hopeful that
                            we will receive considerable support for maintenance of our current
                            operation and for selective increases.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased that the personnel hearings were scheduled early in the
                            legislative year, and I am hopeful that the Committee will be able to
                            report out the bill within the next thirty days. Nevertheless, I want to
                            emphasize that a number of hurdles lie ahead: action by the
                            sub-committee, by the full Foreign Affairs Committee, by the Rules
                            Committee and finally by the House itself. I want you to know, however,
                            that we will do everything we can to help bring the legislation through
                            to final enactment.<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">Reference is to S. 633,

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s announcement
                            in his March 31 nationwide address on the Viet-Nam war that he would not
                            seek or accept the Democratic Party nomination was generally seen by
                            world media as a remarkable act of political and personal
                                selflessness.<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">See <ref target="#d182fn2">footnote 2, Document 182</ref>.</note> Most observers accepted
                            the decision as a laudable effort to prevent the war from becoming an
                            election issue which would impair peace prospects.</p>
                        <p>Editorialists in many countries expressed admiration for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s “courage” and “statemanship”
                            in withdrawing from the race “in the interest of national unity and
                            peace.” At the same time, papers warned against interpreting the action
                            as resignation or surrender.</p>
                        <p>The President’s accomplishments won considerable praise, especially his
                            “unparalleled” success in bringing about advances in the fields of civil
                            rights, health care, and education. Some papers said the Great Society
                            and the New Deal<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">The New Deal was a series
                                of laws and programs initiated by President <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Franklin Roosevelt</persName> and his
                                administration in the mid-to-late 1930s to help the United States
                                recover from the severe economic crisis, commonly referred to as the
                                Great Depression, into which it had fallen following the stock
                                market crash in October 1929.</note> would be linked together in
                            history as periods of great domestic reform.</p>
                        <p>In several instances papers critical of U.S. actions interpreted the
                            decision not to run as an admission that U.S. Viet-Nam policy had failed
                            to achieve its objectives. However, many critics thought the
                            announcement was a “supreme and noble” effort to bring peace in Viet-Nam
                            and unity on the home front.</p>
                        <p>Foreign media emphasized that the withdrawal from the Presidential race
                            greatly increased Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s
                            freedom of action in the difficult months ahead. A number of observers
                            speculated that a successful conclusion of the Viet-Nam war might set in
                            motion a draft-<persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>

                            it has become quite apparent that world opinion will play a large role
                            in determining the positions of the North Vietnamese negotiators.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">Formal peace negotiation talks between the

                                        were enumerated by <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName> as “areas in which it seems

                                        States and North Vietnam. According to <persName corresp="#p_HWA_1">Harriman</persName>: “First, we both
                                        speak of an independent, democratic, peaceful and prosperous
                                        South Vietnam. You also speak of a neutral South Vietnam. We
                                        have no problem with this if that is South Vietnam’s wish.
                                        Second, we both speak of peace on the basis of respect of
                                        the Geneva accords of 1954—to which we add the 1962
                                        agreements on Laos. Third, we both speak of letting the
                                        internal affairs of South Vietnam be settled by the South
                                        Vietnamese themselves—which we would clarify by adding
                                        ‘without outside interference or coercion.’ Fourth, we both
                                        speak of the reunification of Vietnam by peaceful means. In
                                        our view this must not only be peaceful but also through the
                                        free choice of the people of South Vietnam and of North
                                        Vietnam. Fifth, we both speak of the need for strict respect
                                        of the military provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords.”

                            <p>Meanwhile, in other areas of the world, the press has made some of
                                the same points, emphasizing the President’s efforts to achieve an
                                honorable peace despite Hanoi’s intransigence. However, media in
                                Saigon, Seoul, and Bangkok have reflected deep concern that in
                                pursuing peace, the U.S. might be led to remove its protective

                            process was completed prior to December 31, 1967.</p>

                            which are adjudged deserving, in the national interest, of such
                            support.” This Committee was to review concrete ways of accomplishing
                            this objective.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, we submit for your consideration three basic
                            conclusions:</p>
                        <p>1. Considering only the work of the relatively few voluntary
                            organizations formerly supported by <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, <hi rend="italic">we conclude that no special
                                organizational or funding arrangement for further support is
                                required</hi>. Support to continue essential work of these
                            organizations must come from private sources and regular Federal
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">However, we do see a need for a new program of
                                Federal support for worth-while overseas activities of private,
                                non-profit organizations particularly in developing countries</hi>.
                            We recommend administration of the program by an independent
                            commission.</p>
                        <p>3. To permit adequate consideration of the new program, we believe that
                                <hi rend="italic">legislation should be proposed to the next session
                                of the Congress</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Though we strongly support the termination policy, <hi rend="italic">we
                                were impressed with the worth of the voluntary activities overseas
                                that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> supported</hi>.</p>
                        <quote><p>• The organizations were highly respected on the American
                                scene.</p>
                            <p>• Their leadership was responsible and dedicated.</p>
                            <p>• The work being supported was not covert and was considered
                                worth-while and effective.</p></quote>
                        <p>Of the several hundreds of voluntary organizations doing work overseas,
                                <hi rend="italic">only a few dozen received funds from <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss></hi>. The grants were small—the
                            median annual grant being about $200,000. In the termina<pb n="592" facs="0633" xml:id="pg_592"/>tion process, which was not the
                            responsibility of this Committee, the financial burdens on the
                            organizations were carefully considered. Some organizations received
                            limited contributions to tide them over the period during which they
                            could seek new sources of funds.</p>
                        <p>Early in our deliberations the Committee turned its attention to <hi rend="italic">the important role which all American voluntary
                                organizations are playing overseas</hi>. These organizations have
                            for many years been involved effectively in humanitarian, civic, and
                            technical assistance activities.</p>
                        <p>The Committee believes there is <hi rend="italic">an opportunity to
                                expand this role at small cost</hi> compared to the long-range
                            benefits to the United States and peoples of developing countries. We
                            see a need not now being met adequately by existing U.S. Government
                            programs overseas. We see a way of meeting this need which is strongly
                            in the American tradition—the maximum use of the energies and idealism
                            of private citizens.</p>
                        <p>These conclusions are based upon an extensive review. We started with the
                            conclusions of the <persName corresp="#p_KND_1">Katzenbach</persName>
                            Committee. We reviewed the work and funding of over 100 American
                            voluntary organizations with activities overseas. We have consulted
                            extensively with knowledgeable persons in Government and private life.
                            We examined a large number of organizational possibilities—ranging from
                            a Federally-chartered private corporation to inclusion of the proposed
                            program within various existing Federal agencies.</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>An important but little recognized aspect of national development is <hi rend="italic">the role of private, non-profit groups</hi> involved
                            in civic, cultural, professional, and humanitarian activities. In
                            developed and developing countries alike, <hi rend="italic">governments
                                cannot and should not do everything</hi>. Citizens must undertake on
                            their own initiative important economic, social, and political
                            tasks.</p>
                        <p>In the United States, we take voluntary activities for granted. They are
                            a precious part of the American heritage. We have used them to
                            contribute wholly or partly to a large variety of purposes: fire
                            protection, first aid services, health programs, settlement houses, all
                            levels of education, improvement of professional standards,
                            encouragement of sound agricultural and conservation practices,
                            protection of individual rights, development and maintenance of hosts of
                            cultural activities, and meeting the needs of underprivileged children.
                            Total American philanthropy approaches $10 billion annually.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, comparable voluntary organizations and associations are
                            often lacking in developing countries. This lack is both a symptom and a
                            cause of underdevelopment.</p>
                        <p>The Committee believes that voluntary organizations and associations can
                            and should play a special role in developing countries. They <pb n="593" facs="0634" xml:id="pg_593"/>can help to translate individual
                            energies into effective group action. They can grapple more directly
                            with the ancient and entrenched barriers to progress—the apathy and
                            despair of the poor in many lands; social and community disorganization;
                            and the distrust of outsiders and governments beyond the village.</p>

                            been important to our national development and which can help similar

                            national life has been enriched by private voluntary organizations which
                            originated in other countries. Most notable examples are the Red Cross,
                                <gloss target="#t_YMCA_1">YMCA</gloss>’s, the cooperative movement,

                        <p>We believe it desirable to develop <hi rend="italic">a new program of

                            voluntary organizations tend to teach others and work through them, they
                            can make relatively small sums go a long way. A modest public investment
                            of $25 million a year, <hi rend="italic">aimed at the crucial area of

                        <p>In making this recommendation, our Committee is fully aware of possible
                            pitfalls: (a) with scarce funds relative to demand, the commission could
                            dissipate grants over too many worthy organizations; (b) pressures from
                            voluntary organizations could result in spiraling appropriations; and
                            (c) the new source of public support could dry up private contributions,
                            thus merely shifting private activities to the Federal budget.</p>
                        <p>We believe ample protection against such possibilities lies in the
                            effectiveness of Executive and congressional review in the annual budget
                            and appropriation process, the ability of the commission and <pb n="595" facs="0636" xml:id="pg_595"/>staff within appropriations to select
                            innovative and high impact projects, and the establishment in
                            legislation and practice of strict criteria for making grants.</p>
                        <p>We envision that the <hi rend="italic">commission should operate under
                                such groundrules as these</hi>:</p>
                        <quote><p>—Grants would not be given for work which can obtain adequate
                                private financing.</p>
                            <p>—Voluntary organizations to be eligible for grants could not reduce
                                the scope of activities currently supported by private funds.</p>
                            <p>—In choosing among competing grant proposals, the commission would
                                consider the contributions of the voluntary organizations and local
                                groups abroad.</p>
                            <p>—The proposed work would foster an activity or entity in the
                                developing country <hi rend="italic">which will continue on its own
                                    after the grant is completed</hi>.</p>
                            <p>—The commission would give priority to innovative or experimental
                                projects.</p>
                            <p>—The commission would not finance major construction or long-term
                                capital projects.</p>
                            <p>—All grants would be reviewed at least annually.</p></quote>
                        <p>Support for overseas work of private voluntary groups is too important to
                            be left solely to the commission or the Federal Government. A new
                            initiative must be broadly supported by individuals who contribute money
                            and service to the overseas activities of voluntary organizations; by
                            business organizations; and by private foundations and philanthropic
                            entities. <hi rend="italic">There is much to be gained from increased
                                support from all such sources</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, our Committee believes that voluntary organizations should not
                            have to face unnecessary financial burdens and delay (a) in the long
                            project approval process in Federal agencies, and (b) in meeting
                            reporting and other requirements often more suited to larger contracting
                            operations. We believe that the proposed commission and agencies should
                            evaluate rigorously the work carried out. At the same time, we hope they
                            would attune their procedures to the small grants and projects of
                            voluntary organizations.</p>

                        <p>Early in the Committee’s work, the <hi rend="italic">British Council</hi>
                            was discussed as a possible organizational approach to the proposed
                            program. The thirty-man Council is a royally-chartered body, with an
                            annual budget of $28 million, almost all from government appropriations.
                            Its broad purpose is to represent British life and institutions to the
                            world and to increase understanding between Britain and other nations.
                            It combines within its program functions performed in the U.S. by many
                            agencies—academic and cultural exchanges (State); furnishing of
                            libraries, books, lectures, and exhibits (<gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>); technical assistance (<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>); voluntary ser<pb n="596" facs="0637" xml:id="pg_596"/>vices overseas (Peace Corps); and promotion of English language
                            teaching (many U.S. agencies). It employs 3,700 people, about 2,100
                            overseas.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">We concluded that the British Council offered little in
                                the way of a model</hi>. With its mixture of public and private

                            unique to the British system of government.</p>
                        <p>Our recommendation conceives of a body separated from foreign affairs
                            agencies, but with obvious governmental responsibilities. It places
                            primary emphasis on <hi rend="italic">privately developed relations</hi>
                            through voluntary organizations and in fostering private groups and

                        <p>We have examined the desirability of including within the proposed
                            commission a number of functions now performed by Federal agencies. We
                            believe that activities like the following, totalling $10 million, could
                            appropriately be added to the grants to voluntary organizations

                        <p>Some members of the Committee suggested that cultural presentations and
                            exchanges of students, teachers, and researchers might also be added to
                            the program of the new commission. Such an approach, however desirable,
                            would involve the commission at the outset not merely in the making of
                            grants, but also in direct administration of large programs. Moreover,
                            this Committee did not consider a broad <pb n="597" facs="0638" xml:id="pg_597"/>examination of international educational and

                            private organizations overseas.</p>
                        <p>It is a program to give modest but effective help to those who ask it. It
                            is targeted not to government functions, but to things people can do for
                            themselves. It is a program to enlist and support the creative energies
                            of American voluntarism in meeting a great challenge of our time—the
                            conquest of ignorance, famine, disease, and social backwardness in
                            two-thirds of the world. It will provide greater opportunities for <hi rend="italic">an effective and lasting form of

                            participating in the work of the Committee to the degree necessary for a
                            constructive contribution to this report. Confidence in the other
                            members of the Committee reassures me that the task has been approached
                            objectively and diligently. I do wish to restate my conviction that the
                            support formerly provided by the Central Intelligence Agency to
                            voluntary organizations was not nearly so sinister in its design or
                            effect as some critics would have the public believe.”</p>

                        <p>1. The following guidance has been transmitted to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> media:</p>
                        <p>2. All strata of American society are shocked and horrified by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> shooting. From the
                            President and his official family to the lowliest members of the
                            national community, all share the deepest compassion for the Kennedy
                            family. In the words of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, we all pray for the Senator’s recovery.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> was shot after
                                midnight on June 5 in Los Angeles and died on June 6. The actual
                                quotation from <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>’s
                                official statement released after the shooting was: “All America
                                prays for his recovery.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, 1968–1969</hi>, Book
                                I, p. 691)</note></p>
                        <p>3. It can be expected that once the initial statements of shock, horror
                            and grief have been made, there may be a flurry of extremist and
                            intemperate statements, statements critical of “a sick society” which
                            can generate such assassinations. These should be used only in direct
                            ratio to the importance of their authors.</p>
                        <p>4. As in the death of <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John
                                Kennedy</persName>, many in the world again will regard today’s
                            tragic shooting in terms of a conspiracy. We cannot and should not be in
                            a position of adding to, or assessing in any way, this kind of
                            theorizing. We should stick strictly with official comments by the
                            police and other law enforcement agencies. For the time being, avoid
                            picking up non-official comments on this subject from whatever
                            source.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of the events surrounding the killing of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s assassin five years ago, we
                            should watch for and use any details on the legal rights being afforded
                            the man under arrest in today’s shooting. He has been offered the
                            opportunity to have a lawyer, informed of other rights, etc.</p>
                        <p>6. On the basis of descriptions of the alleged assailant, some news items
                            speculate that he might be a Latin American, Mexican-American, Eurasian,
                            etc. We should not use any of these reports pending official
                            confirmation of the man’s identity.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">The
                                individual identified as the man who assassinated <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> was Sirhan Bishara Sirhan,
                                who was born in Jordan, but moved to the United States with his
                                family and grew up in California. He was eventually tried and
                                convicted of the killing. (Ward Just, “The Accused: A Loner Who

                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. Thirty years ago, in 1938, the number of people
                                going from one country to another—from one continent to another—to
                                study, or teach, or do research, or take part in seminars and
                                conferences was a small part of what it is today. The order of
                                increase is so great as to represent almost a new factor in the
                                relations among peoples of the world. Very large numbers of people
                                today know about educational and cultural travel and exchange
                                activities, and the advantages they can open up on both ends of an
                                exchange. More and more people are becoming directly involved in
                                these activities as the growing desire for greater educational and
                                cultural opportunities spreads around the world.</hi></p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Governments of the world have seen the importance of
                                these activities and given them strong encouragement and support.
                                The Government of the United States began organizing to do so 30
                                years ago . . . Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RED_1">Re</persName>, what
                                did happen 30 years ago?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. Well, Mr. Parisi, on July 27, 1938, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Cordell Hull</persName> announced the creation of
                            the first Division of Cultural Relations in our Department of State.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Hull</persName>, you recall, was a
                            vigorous advocate of the Good Neighbor Policy toward our neighbors to
                            the South, and a vigorous proponent of constructive trade and other
                            relations with other parts of the world as well.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. Are we the first nation, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RED_1">Re</persName>, to establish a government
                                program of educational and cultural relations with other
                                countries?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. No, not at all. A number of other governments had already done so. In
                            our country, private organizations had been engaged in such activities
                            for a long time before—foundations, churches, universities, the
                            Institute of International Education, and others.</p>
                        <p><pb n="600" facs="0641" xml:id="pg_600"/>“I might just add that travel
                            for study and related purposes is an old and almost universal world
                            phenomenon. There were the wandering scholars of the Middle Ages in
                            Europe, for example—scholars who clustered at many places, such as
                            Bologna, Paris, and at Oxford, among others. Various waves of
                            civilization carried their cultures with them to other areas.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. Since the United States wasn’t in any sense first,
                                was there anything distinctive about the way we approached these
                                activities?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. I would say that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Hull</persName> planned very well, because his basic ideas continue
                            in today’s broad range of activities. The Cultural Division he created
                            is a direct ancestor of our present Bureau of Educational and Cultural
                            Affairs, though there have of course been many new programs added along
                            the way. Perhaps the <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>
                            Program of academic exchanges, which came a few years later, is the
                            best-known example to most people. Nearly 100,000 people, about
                            two-thirds from other countries, have now been a part of that program
                            since it began a little over 20 years ago. But there have been other
                            programs as well which our Congress has authorized, so that Americans
                            and citizens of other countries and territories could travel to gain the
                            benefits of study, observation, consultation, and friendly association
                            in an academic or other field of special interest.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. What were the particular principles that Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Hull</persName> laid down, Dr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RED_1">Re</persName>?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. Well, he and his principal aide, Dr. Ben Cherrington, laid down two
                            central points, and they have marked these programs throughout these 30
                            years. First, the prime role of our government should be to encourage
                            the widest possible initiative and participation by non-governmental
                            organizations—colleges and universities, corporations, foundations,
                            labor unions, women’s organizations, and other national and community
                            groups. The purpose was to build on the broad base of existing activity
                            in this country. In this way the program could involve the participation
                            of people and institutions representing day-to-day activities throughout
                            the country—thus assuring programs that authentically represented this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>“A second guiding principle for these programs—established at the outset
                            and continued to this day—is that educational and cultural relations
                            should be reciprocal to the maximum extent possible. We do, therefore,
                            honor the memory of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HC_1">Hull</persName> for the strong foundations he laid for these
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. You mentioned the Good Neighbor Policy toward our
                                neighbors to the South. Was this new educational and cultural
                                activity a part of the Good Neighbor Policy?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. It was certainly in the spirit of that policy. The first activities
                            the Division of Cultural Relations undertook were with other countries
                                <pb n="601" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_601"/>of the hemisphere that had
                            signed the Convention for the Promotion of Inter-American Cultural
                            Relations, in Buenos Aires two years before.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. Would you know who some of these first grantees
                                were?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. Yes, I have had that looked up. A Peruvian author and educator,
                            Fernando Romero, was the first of many leaders in Latin American life
                            and letters to come to the United States under the program. Pedro
                            Calmon, lawyer and historian, of Brazil, and Domingo Santa Cruz,
                            musician and diplomat of Chile, were others who came early in the
                            program. The first Americans who went to Latin America under these
                            programs included Thornton Wilder, the playwright, and Rene
                            d’Harnoncourt, who retired early this month as Director of the Museum of

                                what would you say are the purposes of the activities in which you
                                are now engaged?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. The charter for the activities we conduct today is a new and very
                            broad authorizing act, The <persName corresp="#p_FJW_1">Fulbright</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName>
                            Act—more formally known as the <hi rend="italic">Mutual</hi> Educational
                            and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. (I emphasize the word ‘mutual’
                            because it is just that.)</p>
                        <p>“When President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> signed
                            the Act, he said Congress had recognized ‘the importance of a more
                            comprehensive program of educational and cultural activities as a
                            component of our foreign relations.’</p>
                        <p>“The statement of purpose in the Act—an eloquent one, I believe—shows the
                            breadth of the program. Let me cite just a few lines:</p>
                        <p>“‘To increase mutual understanding . . .</p>
                        <p>“‘To strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations . . .</p>
                        <p>“‘To promote international cooperation for educational and cultural
                            advancement;</p>
                        <p>“‘And thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic, and
                            peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of
                            the world.’</p>
                        <p>“Surely you agree that these are eloquent and noble aspirations and
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RED_1">Re</persName>,
                                what kinds of activities are you now conducting?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. Well, I cannot of course describe them all in the few minutes we
                            have. But let me say that on any day we would be engaged in mutual
                            exchanges or related arrangements with countries on all the continents.
                            For example, <gloss target="#t_UNESCO_1">UNESCO</gloss> is holding a
                            conference on education in Africa, in Nairobi, Kenya, and we have
                            representatives there; international visitors—many of them distinguished
                            leaders and specialists—are in our country from Latin America, East
                            Asia, the Near East and South Asia, Europe and Africa. American
                            lecturers, consultants, per<pb n="602" facs="0643" xml:id="pg_602"/>forming artists and athletes are traveling in many parts of the world.
                            These are just a few general examples of current exchanges—both
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. Could you give us a more specific example?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. I might do so in terms of a group project, since it covers many
                            countries and is now in the third of its four-month program in the
                            United States. It is a project for youth leaders and social workers,
                            begun a dozen years ago by citizens of Cleveland, Ohio. This is truly an
                                <hi rend="italic">international</hi> program—with 10 from Africa, 29
                            from Latin America, 75 from Europe, 31 from the Near East and South
                            Asia, and 10 from East Asia and the South Pacific. One reason I believe
                            this program has been so successful is that the talented and dedicated
                            people who come here are so keenly aware of the importance of their work
                            in their societies, and because they are keenly aware, too, that the
                            problems with which they deal are <hi rend="italic">common</hi> problems
                            pretty much the world over.</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Q. There doesn’t seem to be much doubt of your belief
                                that programs like these are beneficial to the individuals who
                                participate and to their countries. Would you explain why you
                                believe this?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. Let me give two reasons. First, in addition to my own commitment—my
                            fundamental faith in education, for example—there is well-documented
                            proof. A survey made a few years ago in 20 other countries—of nearly
                            3,000 former grantees—and an additional 1,100 non-grantee leaders in
                            these countries—left no doubt that these programs do increase mutual
                            understanding, do help to dispel misconceptions, do help to establish
                            channels of communication.</p>
                        <p>“My second reason for faith in these programs is that so many other
                            people—including so many other countries—have faith in them too. We now
                            have agreements with some 48 countries for truly bi-national commissions
                            in those countries to administer the programs there. These commissions,
                            or foundations as they are sometimes called, are composed equally of
                            nationals of the host country and of U.S. citizens resident in that
                            country. In addition, some dozen countries have now pledged financial
                            support through cost-sharing agreements. As Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RDD_1">Rusk</persName> has said, ‘Nothing could better
                            express the mutuality of benefit under international-exchange programs
                            than increasing mutuality of support.’ Over the last year and a half,
                            too, teams of American scholars have visited other countries to discuss
                            with scholars of those countries the directions the program with each
                            country could most usefully take over the next 5–10 years. So far the
                            countries in which such reviews and consultations have taken place are
                            Brazil, Colombia, Finland, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand and
                            Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>“So the program is really world-wide. And it has—in all its parts—brought
                            more than 125,000 persons into it over the last 30 years.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RED_1">Re</persName>, how would you
                                compare the promise—the potential—of such programs today as against
                                30 years ago?</hi></p>
                        <p>“A. The promise and potential have of course been there all the time and
                            the rate of growth has been very rapid. The new fact about today is that
                            these activities are more widely recognized—all over the world—to be
                            valuable. Take education, for example. Last October, 150 education
                            leaders from 52 countries met in this country. It was called the
                            International Conference on the World Crisis in Education. The final
                            report of that conference said that ‘. . . education is now a central
                            preoccupation of every nation in the world.’</p>
                        <p>“President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> had discussed
                            the same point, too, in a special message to Congress in 1966.
                            ‘Education,’ said the President, ‘lies at the heart of every nation’s
                            hopes and purposes.’ Then he added: ‘It must be at the heart of our
                            international relations.’</p>
                        <p>And so, cooperative educational relations among nations are taking a more
                            central place in mankind’s hopes and plans for building a more stable
                            world order. Perhaps this is the best indication we have of the greater
                            promise and potential these activities now have as compared with 30
                            years ago.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 306,

                        <p>As I visited our overseas offices, I found that there was no common
                            symbol identifying the <gloss target="#t_USIS_1">USIS</gloss> operation.
                            In some cases local artists had prepared designs which they thought were
                            appropriate, and in others no symbol was employed.</p>
                        <p>In order that we may have a graphic symbol that would universally
                            identify our publications, films and other informational materials, I
                            asked Bob Sivard to submit appropriate designs. After reviewing a
                            number, I have selected the one shown below—the torch in the up-raised
                            hand of the Statue of Liberty. This design will hereafter be the
                            official <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> symbol.</p>

                            should be printed in red, white and blue. If a press notice is made of
                            the adoption of the symbol, reference should be made to the following
                            statement by me:</p>

                            rewarding, the experience has been a unique privilege.</p>
                        <p>While I did not enter <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as a novice
                            in the field of communications, I was aware that I had a lot to learn.
                            One thing I have learned is that the learning process never ceases. The
                            need to be alert continuously to changing world affairs and to technical
                            changes in the art of communication is the unyielding demand of our
                            profession—and its greatest appeal.</p>
                        <p>There is no orientation program for agency directors. My post-graduate
                            education began immediately.</p>
                        <p><pb n="606" facs="0647" xml:id="pg_606"/>When I appeared before the
                            Senate for confirmation, after President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> had appointed me Director, I said, in my opening
                            statement:</p>
                        <p>“I am aware of the vital role which the <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> plays in explaining and interpreting U.S. policies,
                            actions, and culture to the rest of the world. I am aware that there is
                            today a struggle between democracy and totalitarianism, and that the
                            battleground extends over a wide area. I am confident of the strength of
                            our democracy and of the virtues of our way of life, and I have long
                            contended that communications can serve as a vital force in bringing
                            peoples of the world closer together, creating mutual understanding and
                            trust and removing the barriers which currently separate us.”</p>
                        <p>Very soon after assuming office, however, I realized that my awareness
                            did not take in</p>
                        <p>—The full <hi rend="italic">extent</hi> of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s vital role, nor</p>

                            involved.</p>
                        <p>I entered upon my duties within weeks of U.S. military landings in the
                            Dominican Republic and the destructive, tragic riots in the Watts
                            section of Los Angeles.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">On August 11, 1965,
                                riots broke out in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California
                                following the arrest of an African American motorist. The riots
                                continued for approximately a week. An official investigation report
                                suggested that the causes for the riots were deeper and included
                                poverty, inequality, and racial discrimination. (Dave Smith, “Los

                            trying military-political situation. At home, we were experiencing
                            explosive difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Some of the questions I immediately faced were:</p>
                        <p>—What do such events do to our <hi rend="italic">image</hi> abroad?, and
                            to our <hi rend="italic">influence</hi>?</p>
                        <p>—How do they affect our <hi rend="italic">capacity for leadership</hi> in
                            the world?</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Must</hi> we expose our predicaments, and explain
                            them, overseas?</p>
                        <p>—Should <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> mount <hi rend="italic">crash information programs</hi> with each crisis?</p>
                        <p>—In times like these, to what extent can this country draw upon the
                            reservoir of trust and confidence, created in part by <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s long-range programs, among foreign
                            peoples?</p>
                        <p>These questions themselves reflect the scope of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> responsibility, arising out of this decade’s rapid
                            changes—both political and technological. This Agency’s contribution to
                            national security today involves much more than the “cold war”
                            assignments of an earlier and less complex era. It is not likely that we
                            shall again live in a world comprised <pb n="607" facs="0648" xml:id="pg_607"/>mainly of those “for” and those “against” us; a
                            world in which one could, without argument, designate as “against” us
                            anybody who was not “for” us.</p>
                        <p>Communist initiatives, of course, must still be met. But in the overall
                            job of psychological support of American foreign policy, <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must now deal with a rising tide of
                            participation in the modern world by populations whose attitudes can no
                            longer be defined in simple ideological terms.</p>
                        <p>The “revolution of rising expectations” threatens to give way to a
                            “revolution of rising frustrations.”</p>
                        <p>To encourage the first without setting off the second calls for extreme
                            sensitivity and skill. Realities—such as a nation’s resources and its
                            development timetable—must determine the <hi rend="italic">degree</hi>
                            of encouragement. There are new pressures, which leaders must
                            constructively direct, rather than use as tides upon which to be swept
                            to temporary popularity.</p>
                        <p>The new pressures, and opportunities, of awakening public opinion are a
                            result of a modern two-edged development: the worldwide communications
                            and education “explosion.” My official travels abroad confirmed what I
                            had already observed privately—the transistor radio, television, motion
                            pictures, the jet airplane, and a massive assault on illiteracy are
                            transforming the entire world. For the first time, the remotest villages
                            of the most distant lands are figuratively <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                            literally plugging into the modern world. Information, ideas, and
                            opinions are spreading with the speed of light. Now, people discuss
                            subjects which, until recently, they were not even aware existed as
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>In this new environment, trouble or tension in one part of the world
                            travels like a shock wave to every other part. A seemingly minor
                            incident in a small, far-away place can upset a far wider balance.
                            Isolation is no longer possible for any country—neither physical,
                            political, nor moral.</p>
                        <p>For the work of our Agency, this new rising tide of public involvement in
                            the contemporary world has enormous significance. The potential of
                            American influence on the course of the world is without modern
                            precedent. In the words of those who drafted it, the Declaration of
                            Independence was brought forth “out of a decent respect to the opinions
                            of mankind.” As the power of public opinion has increased, that
                            respect—that <hi rend="italic">responsibility</hi>—has become all the
                            more awesome. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> must lend voice to
                            America’s world influence—and must lend an ear to the words of others—to
                            help place our country in meaningful communication with other
                            people.</p>
                        <p>Within this wider concept of Agency responsibility, I attach great
                            importance to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> collaboration with
                            other elements of the nation’s <pb n="608" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_608"/>foreign affairs community, as well as private organizations active
                            abroad. <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> is spokesman overseas for
                            the Department of State; <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>; the Peace
                            Corps; the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury, and Commerce; the
                            Atomic Energy Commission; <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss>; and
                            other departments and agencies. As spokesman, our Agency cooperates in
                            their programs directed against poverty, hunger, disease,
                            over-population, under-development, and illiteracy. Just as a <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> broadcast or pamphlet refuting a
                            communist distortion about our actions or intentions serves our national
                            interest, so is that interest served by stimulating dialogues between
                            Americans and the peoples of other countries on the great issues of
                            common security and mutual well-being.</p>
                        <p>When I came to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> as your sixth

                            I found an organization well staffed and deployed for what I regard as
                            one of the most varied, subtle, and trying tasks of the U.S. Government.
                            Years of planning and creative effort by previous directors and by the
                            Agency’s senior officers had developed effective patterns of staffing,
                            media production, policy guidance, external relations, and
                            self-evaluation. There was a welcome, unmistakable air of <hi rend="italic">professionalism</hi> about the organization.</p>
                        <p>I immediately began my search for <hi rend="italic">more efficient
                                methods</hi> and <hi rend="italic">more sharply defined goals</hi>.
                            Innovations were introduced. New products and services were added;
                            out-dated ones were pruned away. To existing procedures I have tried to
                            apply new management criteria, to introduce new technologies. Progress
                            has been made in adapting the Program-Planning-Budget-System to <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s work.<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">Regarding the <gloss target="#t_PPBS_1">PPBS</gloss>, see <ref target="#d108fn2">footnote 2, Document 108</ref>.</note>
                            Experiments were undertaken, and are now under way, in computerization,
                            miniaturization, and multimedia use of products.</p>
                        <p>I tried to reduce paper work, abolish ancient report forms, and simplify
                            our communication <hi rend="italic">with each other</hi>. You have
                            responded to the challenge to modernize by eliminating <hi rend="italic">546</hi> forms, by cutting down on our cable traffic, and by making
                            reports readable as reports—rather than as doctoral theses.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I have never shied away from the word <hi rend="italic">propaganda</hi>. But I have operated on the premise that <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> is our best propaganda. While that may seem
                            self-evident, it is well to remind ourselves that there are still many
                            countries which would not dare to adopt such a policy. They have
                            imitated our magazine formats, and they have copied the style of our
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts. But they have
                            refused to accept the <pb n="609" facs="0650" xml:id="pg_609"/>thesis
                            that it is important to <hi rend="italic">tell it as it is</hi>. When
                            they do, we will all move to a new stage of international
                            togetherness.</p>
                        <p>I have shared with you the joys of success, but also occasional
                            impatience about what seemed too small an accomplishment in this or that
                            place or fleeting disappointment that, on some occasion, we have not
                            been able to make ourselves fully understood. But I take refuge in the
                            philosophy that “it is better to understand a little than to
                            misunderstand a lot.”</p>
                        <p>Like you, I have sometimes felt discouraged about the hard fact that
                            there are places where we cannot hope to achieve agreement—where even
                            the creation of a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> understanding must be
                            attempted in the face of great odds. As Woodrow Wilson pointed out,
                            “Comprehension <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be the soil in which grow all
                            the fruits of friendship.”<note n="6" xml:id="d190fn6"><persName corresp="#p_MLH_1">Marks</persName> is quoting from an address
                                President <persName corresp="#p_WDM_1">Wilson</persName> delivered
                                before the Southern Commercial Congress in Mobile, Alabama, on

                        <p>Much has been done but more remains. Our kaleidoscopic world refuses to
                            let us rest on past accomplishments and shoves us forward with changes
                            which we sometimes cannot fathom.</p>
                        <p>Whether it is electronic music, “put-ons” or “happenings”—we must “get
                            with it.” Words and ideas are our tools and we must use today’s advanced
                            vocabulary and not yesterday’s classic speech. And <hi rend="italic">we
                                are</hi>—that’s why there never has been a dull period nor is there
                            likely to be.</p>
                        <p>Above all, I have devoted my energies to nurturing the Agency’s most
                            precious resource: our personnel. From my pre-Agency travels abroad,
                            when I had seen <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> officers in
                            action, I knew the pressures placed upon them in the field. And I knew
                            how they met those pressures, facing skeptical or downright hostile
                            audiences, combatting local prejudice in an effort to win understanding
                            and respect for our country.</p>
                        <p>And I recognize the valued contributions of our foreign national
                            employees, who provide the continuity and essential experience for our
                            overseas operations.</p>
                        <p>To the seasoned ranks we have brought in new blood, including numbers of
                            bright young people fresh from college. At the same time, we have not
                            turned our backs on the corps of older, experienced officers. Those who
                            entered <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> from the ranks of many
                            professions in the late 1940’s and 1950’s, with zeal and idealism,
                            remain the backbone of the Agency. New programs of mid-career training
                            update skills and knowledge of contemporary Americana—reinvigorating the
                            contribution of senior officers already rich in media, language, area,
                            and managerial competence.</p>
                        <p><pb n="610" facs="0651" xml:id="pg_610"/>I take special pride in the
                            performance of our field officers, the junior officer trainees, and the
                            management interns. From my experience in professional life, I well know
                            that most of these people could choose other careers—with far higher
                            rewards, both financial and in terms of public recognition.</p>
                        <p>Good, healthy patriotism draws such men and women to the Agency, and the
                            challenge of the job keeps them there. It has been most gratifying to me
                            to identify the magnetism of this challenge on Agency personnel and
                            performance. I was particularly pleased to see it recognized this year
                            in the Congressional enactment of the Pell-<persName corresp="#p_HW_1">Hays</persName> Act, establishing a permanent <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> foreign service corps on the same
                            footing as the foreign service of the Department of State.<note n="7" xml:id="d190fn7">See <ref target="#d30fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    30</ref>.</note> The commissioning of 592 men and women as the
                            first Foreign Service Information Officers was, for me, an outstanding
                            highlight of my three-year tenure.</p>
                        <p>Last week, a reporter, interviewing me for a roundup feature story on my
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> years, asked me what I would
                            expect to be the most enduring contribution of my administration. I have
                            thought about that question since and would now answer it: “An
                            advancement of the stature and role of our personnel; greater emphasis
                            on their training, with resulting higher standards of professionalism.”
                            It is trite to say that we are no better than the people we employ; but
                            you, the Agency career people, the civil service and the local staffs
                            everywhere, are the vital resource which must always be nurtured. On
                            your efforts rests the success or failure of our mission.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>’s work is the kind of activity
                            whose effectiveness cannot be measured fully, nor does it lend itself to
                            public recognition.</p>
                        <p>Within the family, however, it is another matter, and that is why this
                            ceremony is so vital to me.</p>
                        <p>These annual honor awards ceremonies have rightly come to occupy a
                            special place in our scheme of things. They represent <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> recognition of <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> accomplishment. The outside observer could not be
                            expected to understand the significance or intrinsic value of our honor
                            awards. But within the family, the importance of the occasion and the
                            reception by one’s colleagues make it very special. And so, I salute
                            those of you who are honored today and congratulate the Agency on your
                            achievements. As we honor you, you honor us by your presence.</p>
                        <p>I have been spoiled, and I hope my successors will be, by the performance
                            standards of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>. <hi rend="italic">Excellence</hi> has become the criterion against which we measure
                                <hi rend="italic">satisfactory</hi> performance. And this, in my
                            mind, further enhances the significance of the annual honor awards.</p>
                        <p><pb n="611" facs="0652" xml:id="pg_611"/>I have said that my greatest
                            concern has been with the Agency’s most precious asset—the human
                            resource.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to express <hi rend="italic">how</hi> strongly I have
                            felt about that.</p>
                        <p>But let me underscore it:</p>
                        <p>I have delayed my departure from <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>,
                            and postponed the assumption of my new duties, because I wanted to
                            preside at today’s honor award ceremonies—and to thank you for the great
                            satisfaction you have given me during the three years I have had the
                            honor to be your Director. And now that chapter ends.</p>
                        <p>Today is my last day as Director of <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>And this will be my last official act.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the unstinting cooperation you have given me, and I
                            salute you for what you are doing on behalf of our country.</p>
                        <p>My thoughts will be with you.</p>
                        <p>I will miss you more than you will miss me. I will look back upon happy
                            years, exciting experiences, new and lasting friendships; and I will
                            always remember colleagues with whom I shared satisfying achievements,
                            laughter, anger, sadness, excitement, and, sometimes, frustration—but
                            never boredom.</p>
                        <p>And so, may it always be.</p>

                        <p>In the decade and a half after the second world war, most people around
                            the world came to think of America as a “success story” of incredible
                            economic, scientific, technological, and social progress. Recent
                            headlines about political assassinations, urban violence, racial strife,
                            and student revolt in the U.S., thrown against this background, could
                            not help but baffle our foreign audiences and leave many with the
                            feeling that they had, somehow, been cheated into thinking this country
                            was strong, healthy, progressive, an epitome of success. One concept
                            which may, over time, help us deal with the apparent contradiction is
                            that of rapid change.</p>
                        <p>While we have occasionally spoken of “permanent revolution,” we have
                            perhaps failed to communicate the measure in which change itself is of
                            the essence of our society—and of our time—and to prepare people abroad
                            for the often painful spectacles that accompany such rapid and
                            fundamental transformations in a large social organism. As we explain
                                <pb n="613" facs="0654" xml:id="pg_613"/>these processes, we can
                            hope to reconcile the clashing images of America and provide a cushion
                            against the shocks produced by episodes of violence and conflict. As we
                            succeed in conveying something of the excitement of change and in
                            drawing our audiences into the whole complex of our awesome problems and
                            breathtaking opportunities, our experiments and failures, as well as
                            successes, we can enhance their sympathetic understanding and hope that
                            they will come to identify with us and to respect us.</p>
                        <p>The following major themes are suggested:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Our Strains and Stresses Reflect Change, Not
                                Sickness.</hi></p>
                        <p>The statistics of spectacular growth (population, <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, educational system, agricultural and
                            industrial technology, etc.), following patterns of geometric
                            progression, bear witness to the continuing vitality of America. This
                            growth has been accompanied by profound economic, social, and
                            psychological changes. It has, at the same time, brought into focus many
                            long-unresolved problems and has left in its wake completely new
                            problems as well.</p>
                        <p>This, the rapid realization of the promise of the Twentieth Century and
                            an awareness of the threat of crisis which it contains, is an experience
                            shared by the United States with many other countries. The United States
                            is in the vanguard, within reach of the promise and therefore perhaps
                            most sharply aware of the threat.</p>
                        <p>Technology is transforming our economy into a new kind of structure often
                            described as “post-industrial.” A new pattern of relationships between
                            government, industry, organized labor, and the educational establishment
                            is evolving. The mechanization of agriculture has accelerated the
                            movement of farm laborers—a great many of them representing minority
                            groups—to urban centers, while higher incomes, city congestion, auto
                            expressways have led middle-class Americans to the suburbs. The economic
                            gap between the skilled, eagerly sought after by ever more automated
                            industries, and the unskilled, for whom there is less and less
                            employment, has widened—the poor becoming relatively, and in some cases
                            absolutely, poorer—although the percentage of the poor in the whole
                            society has continued to diminish.</p>
                        <p>Our pursuit of economic and technological growth and progress has led us
                            at times to neglect some other, equally important, values and purposes.
                            It has also become evident that our social and political mechanisms and
                            habits have adapted much more slowly than they should have in the face
                            of accelerating population growth, urbanization, technological progress,
                            and productivity. Mass communications, especially television, sharpen
                            the feeling of the poor that they are being left behind. They also make
                            the more affluent feel that the “American dream” is being violated by
                            the existence of poverty, even hunger, in the richest society the world
                            has ever known. The steady progress of <pb n="614" facs="0655" xml:id="pg_614"/>black Americans, as a race, toward legal equality
                            everywhere in the country and, as individuals, to higher positions in
                            business and government, adds just enough expectation to their sense of
                            bitterness to give explosive urgency to their demands for immediate and
                            complete social and economic justice. The relatively undeveloped state
                            of our skills in speeding the processes of social development and the
                            loss of the individual’s feeling of participation in the ever-growing,
                            more complex, unwieldy, and impersonal social and economic environment
                            combine to produce a sense of isolation and insecurity on the part of
                            the affluent and the poor alike.</p>
                        <p>All these developments have necessitated a re-examination of a whole list
                            of ethical and practical assumptions. These had served America well in
                            bringing into the movement of economic progress larger and larger
                            segments of a population coming from a multitude of different cultural
                            backgrounds. Now, however, that we are dealing with the hard core of
                            poverty and underprivilege in a highly sophisticated technological
                            society, we are finding that hard work without skill is no longer enough
                            to keep a family afloat; that free public education has not been
                            flexible enough to cope with the “subculture of poverty”; that the best
                            public housing becomes a slum when inhabited by people without jobs,
                            local political leverage, and social skills; that welfare is not
                            necessarily temporary help on the way to a solution of human problems
                            but often a dead end; that the movement for racial integration may have,
                            in spite of apparent successes, failed to stem the trend toward “two
                            Americas”; that honest courts do not always assure equal justice; and
                            that clean elections do not inevitably result in effective
                            representation of all the people.</p>
                        <p>These changes and reassessments have led many Americans, especially the
                            young, to question vigorously, sometimes noisily, just about all the
                            premises of Western civilization in general and present-day America in
                            particular. Much as young people do all over the world just now, many
                            young Americans challenge “the system,” the ideals of their elders, and
                            their elders’ failure to live up to those ideals. They are often
                            intemperate in their rhetoric and unduly reluctant to reject the
                            nihilists and demagogues in their own ranks.</p>
                        <p>All this makes for painful self-examination, self-criticism, search for
                            new definitions of the national purpose, strain and conflict. It is a
                            time similar to other periods in the past when many old problems came to
                            a head and many people came to feel that they had reached a fork in the
                            road of history. The uneasiness is worldwide today, but it is perhaps
                            more intense in America than elsewhere. We are further along the road of
                            industrial development, “ahead” of the rest of the world not only in
                            technological achievements but in the nature of our problems as well.
                            Our role is to pioneer in finding solutions to these <pb n="615" facs="0656" xml:id="pg_615"/>problems, and it must be in the
                            interest of those who in time will face comparable problems that we find
                            our way.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">An Atmosphere of Intense Questioning and Dissent
                                Contains Risks, But Opportunities as Well</hi>.</p>
                        <p>A tendency to self-examination and the willingness to discard outdated
                            premises have characterized American society from its beginnings. What
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWS_1">Churchill</persName> called our “genius
                            for self-criticism” has in the past finally always proved to be a source
                            of strength rather than of decay. We have perhaps never, certainly not
                            in a hundred years, probed as deeply or attempted to solve problems as
                            complex as at this moment in our history. The occasion is not one for
                            shame, nor for panic that our social fabric is being “rent apart.” We
                            can take some pride in our courage to <hi rend="italic">take</hi> it
                            apart, our candor in confronting what is wrong with it, and our
                            intent—though not always our success—in experimenting with new
                            solutions. In view of America’s record in past crises, we can also show
                            some confidence in our ability to put the fabric together again, in a
                            pattern more in harmony with the demands of our time as well as with our
                            firmly held principles.</p>
                        <p>One of these principles, the right to free speech and the freedom to
                            dissent, is responsible for many misunderstandings of America abroad;
                            but it is also a most important instrument for the society’s adaptation
                            to rapid change. Civil disobedience, though of course never immune to
                            legal sanctions, also has roots in the American tradition and has
                            sometimes contributed to changing society. More often, however, the
                            required adjustments were brought about peacefully, in orderly fashion,
                            within the framework of our social and legal institutions. The electoral
                            process, the courts which continuously re-interpret the fundamental
                            laws, the ever more diverse, burgeoning educational system, the
                            foundations, the churches (most of which have been in the vanguard of
                            progress for many years now), civic groups, voluntary organizations,
                            private enterprise and the trade unions—all these are, by and large,
                            prepared to participate, or to lead, in experiments with new solutions
                            for problems which no society has ever previously encountered, or
                            certainly not on a comparable scale. There is, along with concern,
                            impatience, and frustration, a new spirit of adventure in the land,
                            characterized more by sober resolve than by easy optimism, more by
                            growing self-knowledge than by facile self-confidence.</p>
                        <p>It may be possible to communicate some of this spirit not only by telling
                            about it but also through the products of contemporary American writers,
                            artists and musicians. Many of our audiences abroad have reason to be
                            interested in our unsolved problems—some of which already face them,
                            others of which soon will. If we place the emphasis on the search for
                            solutions as well as on their achievement, then the failures, setbacks,
                            and backlashes which we are bound to encounter over time will also be
                            more comprehensible to our audiences.</p>

                        <p>In no group are the concern with human values, the spirit of questioning,
                            and the predisposition to adventure more alive than among that segment
                            of American youth which has largely been setting the tone on many
                            university campuses. A decade ago, college professors were still
                            complaining about the “silent generation,” apathetic, efficient, and
                            materialistic. Today, the complaint is about hippies and extremists—the
                            relatively few who have proved incapable of dealing constructively with
                            their despair, frustration, or anger. These, however, represent no more
                            than the froth on top of the waves of the much larger number of socially
                            committed, independent and irreverent young people at our universities,
                            radical in their analysis of facts and principles, rigorous in their
                            idealism and their rejection of cant. They feel what young people often
                            felt and what Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed this way: “We are to revise
                            the whole of our social structure, the State, the school, religion,
                            marriage, trade, science, and explore their foundations in our own
                            nature; we are to see that the world not only fitted the former men, but
                            fits us, and to clear ourselves of every usage which has not its roots
                            in our own mind.”<note n="3" xml:id="d191fn3">Reference is to the 19th

                        <p>The new generation was raised in this period of rapid change and taught
                            to respond to it. Trained for intellectual excellence, the most gifted
                            members of this generation are, nevertheless, distrustful of reason
                            untempered by feeling and moral direction. These are individualists,
                            enemies of all violence, democrats to the point of rejecting all
                            hierarchy, patriots in their pained sensitivity to every imperfection
                            which they perceive in their country, and as indifferent to material
                            gain as their secure childhood could make them. They are more likely to
                            spend their spare time tutoring underprivileged children than going to
                            football games; more inclined to become public servants than to seek
                            prosperous careers in their specialties; to place higher value on their
                            personal independence than on the accepted marks of success.</p>
                        <p>Americans, more than most others, have always looked to their children to
                            accomplish the tasks left undone by their own generation. In this
                            instance, having raised the young with as few constraints and
                            preconceived ideas as possible, and given unprecedented numbers of them
                            the opportunity for higher education, some are shocked by the radicalism
                            of the “new breed.” As the shock wears off, the dialogue and the
                            cooperation between the two halves of our people—those under 25 and
                            those over—show signs of becoming more constructive. <pb n="617" facs="0658" xml:id="pg_617"/>Both share the most fundamental ideals:
                            equality, social justice, patriotism, and a desire for peace in the
                            world. Only, these young people, never having experienced the kind of
                            struggle for survival which their parents knew, feel less special pride
                            in America’s past achievements, but rather responsibility for solving
                            the problems of the present and the future. Having never had to fear
                            competition for employment, their insistence on equal rights for less
                            fortunate groups is freer of reservations. More concerned about feelings
                            than about efficiency, they can “relate” to people of other social and
                            cultural backgrounds than their own and communicate with them. Knowing
                            more about the world outside their country and less about wars, which
                            their parents deplored but, somehow, always expected, they are both more
                            naive and less rigid in their ideas on how to achieve lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>Remarkably free of prejudices, rich in energy and idealism, competent in
                            the new arts of the Twentieth Century, with its new and more complex
                            ways, these young people are equipped to contribute to America’s
                            progress and to play a constructive role in the world.</p>

                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): Where do you begin? Where do you look?
                                Like an ancient battlefield, the ground is silent, though people
                                still move in familiar places. Now, on this field, Negro and white
                                run together, remembering not how it was in Little Rock, Arkansas,
                                in 1957.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps it is best for those today to look where they are going and
                                not where they have been. But when you’re a dark man in a country
                                where the Negro is demanding more and more an equal chance, you have
                                the right to look back to discover if you are really moving forward,
                                or if the world is just moving beneath your feet.</p>
                            <p>I have a special reason for looking back. My name is Jefferson
                                Thomas. And I’m one of the nine from Little Rock.</p>
                            <p>There is nothing strange in seeing nine American children walking to
                                school on a September morning. But this was a special morning in a
                                special part of America, a place where Negro children had never gone
                                to school with whites before.</p>
                            <p>[DRAMATIC MUSIC]</p>
                            <p>Hatred is easier to organize than understanding. And there was a
                                minority in our state who found it to their advantage to bring hate
                                to Little Rock in 1957. While we watched, the white children went to
                                school, and we stood outside.</p>
                            <p>We had been taught in school that we were a nation under law. And the
                                law said segregation was wrong. Now, we waited to see if our laws
                                had meaning or were just words in a book or idle talk in a
                                classroom.</p>
                            <p>SERGEANT: Company halt.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): On September 27, 1957, President
                                Eisenhower sent 1,000 men of the United States Army to carry out the
                                law. The Supreme Court of the United States had said the entire
                                strength of a nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land
                                the security of all rights entrusted by the Constitution. And that
                                included my rights and the rights of eight other Negro Americans who
                                wanted to go to Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>
                            <p>We were Terrence Roberts, Thelma Mothershed, Elizabeth Eckford,
                                Ernest Green, Carlotta Walls, Melba Pattillo, Minnijean Brown, and
                                Gloria Ray. And we were going to school again.</p>
                            <p>SERGEANT: Forward ho! 1, 2.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): Obviously, in this town of 100,000,
                                there were many who didn’t like what was happening. But as we looked
                                at the soldiers, we knew there must be millions of others who
                                thought we represented something important.</p>
                            <p>When the doors closed behind us that day, it was both an end and a
                                beginning. From that moment on, we would be watched, not only by
                                those who looked at us as strangers, but by those who wondered if we
                                would live up to our new opportunity. I remember standing there,
                                wondering how history would judge us.</p>
                            <p>[CLOCK CHIMING]</p>
                            <p>It’s been seven years since that first day. What has happened? Where
                                have we gone? What have we done?</p>
                            <p>MINNIJEAN BROWN (VOICEOVER): I was the oldest of the nine and perhaps
                                the least serious. I came here to Southern Illinois University after
                                graduation. At first, I thought I wanted to be a nurse, but I was
                                too outgoing for that. Now I know I want to work in a newspaper, to
                                be a journalist, and to write.</p>
                            <p>More than anything else in the world, I want to write. This year, I
                                took a job in the university newspaper. I work as a reporter 20
                                hours a week after classes. There’s no substitute for writing under
                                pressure, to have to get the story out and to make it good.</p>
                            <p>I remember the reporters who came from all over the world to cover
                                the story of Little Rock. To be able to take a story like that and
                                to put it into words is something I’ve always wanted to be able to
                                do. Someday, I’m going to write a book about what happened in Little
                                Rock. But first, I’ve got to learn more about writing and about the
                                world. And you can do that best in school.</p>
                            <p>Teachers like Professor Simon have helped me to grow up. He’s a man
                                who makes you want to go to school forever. But I’m going to work
                                after I graduate. I’ve applied to two newspapers, and one has
                                already offered me a job.</p>

                            <p>I’m going to miss this university. The friendships I have made here
                                are long and deep. The things I have learned here have helped me to
                                come to terms with myself. For the first time in my life, I have
                                begun to understand why some Americans act the way they do. I know
                                now, some Americans have a fear of the Negro, a fear borne of a way
                                of life that has been dead in this country since the end of slavery.
                                That’s what the mob in Little Rock was afraid of—that the Negro, who
                                had done so much with no chance, might do so much more with an equal
                                one.</p>

                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): It’s been four years since I stood in
                                this hallway and watched the faces moving from class to class. None
                                of this would seem strange to us now, for we all went on to colleges
                                where there were more whites than Negroes, except Elizabeth. She
                                went to Central State College in Ohio.</p>
                            <p>ELIZABETH ECKFORD (VOICEOVER): Central State was founded as an
                                all-Negro college about 100 years ago. Today, like most American
                                schools, it is a mixture of Negro and white. When I entered high
                                school, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer, and then a teacher.</p>
                            <p>And now, like most students, I haven’t quite decided what I want to
                                be. The world is a big place. And when I go out into it, I want to
                                be sure I go in the right direction.</p>

                            <p>If it hadn’t been for that morning in September 1957, I could have
                                gone into law or education and not thought much about it. I was
                                frightened that morning. But I learned a great deal about people—not
                                only about the people who were there, but about the people who were
                                not there, like the politician who encouraged the mob, like the
                                thousands who suffered with me and wrote to me to tell me so.</p>
                            <p>While I waited, I heard brave voices speak out against intolerance.
                                And I saw grown men turn their heads in shame from a camera.</p>

                            <p>ELIZABETH ECKFORD (VOICEOVER): Central State is a Negro college that
                                opened its doors to whites only 17 years ago. Today, 20% of the
                                student body and faculty are white. And there are still Negroes who
                                are against integration. The Negro is like most Americans,
                                possessing no monopoly on tolerance and hoping that the few, the
                                uninformed, will not be confused with the rest us.</p>
                            <p>STUDENTS: (SINGING) —shoo-wop, shoo-waddy-waddy-wop.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): Four years ago, a Negro walked this
                                hall in fear. Some of the hate outside had come inside. And there
                                were a few who tried to impose their will on the many.</p>
                            <p>When we went up a stairway, we hung on to the railing.</p>
                            <p>MAN: Can I help you?</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS: Uh, I’m looking for Miss Poindexter’s room.</p>
                            <p>MAN: Mm-hm. She’s in room 214.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS: Thank you very much.</p>
                            <p>MAN: Any time.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): Thelma used to say the problems we had
                                getting into this school were worth it just to be able to take
                                courses from some of the teachers. It’s not surprising so many
                                students like Thelma wanted to go into teaching.</p>
                            <p>THELMA MOTHERSHED (VOICEOVER): I graduate this year from Southern
                                Illinois University at Carbondale. Going to college is a tradition
                                in my family. That’s why I applied for Central. I wanted a good high
                                school education. I wanted the best training I could get before I
                                entered college.</p>
                            <p>Aspirations are very personal things. But I think I can state mine
                                simply. I love to teach, and I love children. Children are happy,
                                moody, difficult, and wonderful. They accept me for what I am.</p>
                            <p>After I finish college, I want to apply for a job teaching in Little
                                Rock, maybe someday at Central High. I wonder what it’ll be
                                like.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): Thelma, Carlotta, and I had Miss Dunn.
                                None of us had seen a school with so much equipment before. I think
                                it was the equipment that first gave Ernie the impression he wanted
                                to be an engineer. But I’m glad he changed his mind.</p>

                                rising against it. And I want to be part of it.</p>

                            <p>ERNEST GREEN (VOICEOVER): I came to Michigan State to study
                                engineering. Three years ago, I changed my mind. I decided I would
                                rather work with people than with machines.</p>
                            <p>Under Professor David Gottlieb, I received my bachelor’s degree in
                                sociology. Next week, I will receive my master’s. I’m convinced that
                                a white American can never fully understand what motivates the
                                Negro’s desire for equality. But the white American is becoming more
                                concerned, especially my generation. And that makes tomorrow worth
                                dreaming about.</p>

                            <p>The American Negro must protest. And he must also build understanding
                                by searching for the truth. The tools for truth and science are now
                                becoming tools for truth and human relations. For the past two
                                years, I have been compiling data on the aspirations of Negro and
                                white children in a segregated community. Today, we are capable of
                                getting answers that have real meaning, that carry the power of fact
                                against those who would exploit rumor and prejudice.</p>
                            <p>My research is just one part in a quiet revolution that’s taking
                                place in America. It’s not alone a revolution in technology, but a
                                revolution in thinking, a revolution that says man, no matter how
                                humble his birth, what color his skin, must be permitted to go as
                                far as his mind and his aspirations will take him.</p>
                            <p>JEFFERSON THOMAS (VOICEOVER): Ernie was the first of us to graduate
                                from Central. Carlotta and I were the last. We were the class of
                                1960.</p>
                            <p>Carlotta goes to Denver University in Colorado. She’s a good student,
                                and she likes the high mountains out there. Gloria Ray is a senior
                                at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This year, she receives her
                                degree in chemistry.</p>
                            <p>Terrence Roberts is studying for his degree in business
                                administration at the City College of Los Angeles. Melba Pattillo,
                                as we guessed, married early. She wasn’t in college over a year
                                before she became a housewife.</p>
                            <p>And me—this spring, I take an exam to become a certified public
                                accountant. That means I’m supposed to be qualified to keep track of
                                profits and losses. I’m not sure I know enough yet to say what all
                                this adds up to. I haven’t counted all the victories since that
                                first day we went to school here. But I know there’s been at least
                                nine.</p>
                            <p>In Little Rock, there’s a slow bridge taking shape over that chasm of
                                intolerance and ignorance. It’s a bridge that’s going to be built by
                                us and by our children. Before it’s finished, we’re going to have
                                our problems. But if Little Rock taught nothing more, it taught all
                                Americans that problems can make us better, much better.</p>

                            <p>PRESIDENT LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON: Good afternoon, ladies and
                                gentlemen.</p>
                            <p>EDWARD P. MORGAN: In the State Department auditorium in Washington
                                DC, the President of the United States confronts the press. Here, or
                                around the White House garden, in his office, or on his Texas ranch,
                                he faces reporters. He learns from their questions, the mood of
                                Americans. The press, which is not obliged to be friendly, comes to
                                ask the questions only the President can answer.</p>
                            <p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Now I’m ready to answer any questions you may
                                have.</p>
                            <p>[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p>
                            <p>PRESS 1: I wonder if you could tell us what your interpretation of
                                the viewpoint of the American people is on the Cuban problem and
                                what should be done about it?</p>
                            <p>PRESS 2: Do you and the Defense Department foresee a possible
                                withdrawal of our military wives and children from Saigon or other
                                Southeast Asia command posts in the foreseeable future?</p>
                            <p>PRESS 3: Can you give us some elaboration of what you meant by
                                extremist elements?</p>
                            <p>PRESS 4: Have you received any such evidence that would back up such
                                indication?</p>

                            <p>PRESS 6: And could you give us your philosophy of civilian-military
                                relationships in this particular area of nuclear weapons?</p>
                            <p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I believe that the final responsibility for all
                                decisions on nuclear weapons must rest with the civilian head of
                                this government, the President of the United States. The man who is
                                President can never get away from that responsibility and can never
                                forget it. I believe that’s the way the American people want it.</p>
                            <p>MR. MORGAN: It is to the people that the President is finally
                                answerable.</p>
                            <p>MAN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>
                            <p>MR. MORGAN: By newspapers, radio, and television, the press will
                                report the President’s answers to the people. The reporters’
                                questions reflect the thoughts, and wants, and worries of the
                                people. In a democratic society, a President cannot govern if he
                                does not understand the people. He must have their support. The
                                Presidency, Lyndon Johnson has said, is an office not of power, but
                                of persuasion.</p>
                            <p>A President can help people toward their highest desires, but he
                                cannot take them where they do not want to go. Obviously, the
                                President cannot speak or listen personally to everybody in a nation
                                of more than 190 million people. The press provides a vital
                                communications link. No one in the world is photographed, followed,
                                observed, and questioned by as large a permanent press corps as the
                                man who occupies the White House.</p>
                            <p>[APPLAUSE]</p>
                            <p>The U.S. President is also the nation’s principal celebrity. He must
                                fulfill many roles. As a diplomat, he must propose and try to
                                establish policies which contribute to the peace, security, and
                                well-being of not only his nation, but of the world. As chief
                                executive, he must administer a gigantic governmental organization.
                                And it is he who must finally answer the toughest questions.</p>
                            <p>Yet even as he does all these things, he must be a practical
                                politician. His party expects him to lead it to success in the next
                                election. And, in a country which has no monarch, it is the
                                President who must perform the multitude of ceremonial duties, which
                                protocol demands.</p>

                            <p>Every public act of the President is reported by the White House
                                press corps. Numbering over 1,200, they represent radio and TV
                                networks, newspapers, and magazines. They write for small town
                                weeklies, big city dailies. They come from many countries, from the
                                great news-gathering services of England, Japan, and the Soviet
                                Union. Some of these reporters have covered as many as eight or nine
                                presidents.</p>
                            <p>Their job is to monitor a steady stream of information that
                                originates in the White House—press releases to be read, checked,
                                and culled over. Information comes personally from the President’s
                                Press Secretary at regular morning and afternoon briefings or
                                whenever questions arise.</p>
                            <p>PRESS 7: Well, what I’m getting at is—</p>
                            <p>PRESS SECRETARY GEORGE REEDY: I’ll be available.</p>
                            <p>MR. MORGAN: But the White House reporters’ most important source of
                                news is the President himself. At any moment of any day, the most
                                significant news story may break here. Television crews, news film
                                cameramen, and reporters make preparations, and wait, and wait. The
                                moment often comes without warning. Lyndon Baines Johnson enjoys the
                                spontaneous, such as this impromptu conversation with reporters on
                                the White House grounds.</p>
                            <p>[LAUGHTER]</p>
                            <p>But in this informal talk, as in the formal press conference, the
                                questions touch on urgent matters. When the President faces the
                                press, he risks criticism and opposition. But this is a risk he must
                                take. Only a free press will ask the difficult, the frank question.
                                And only the frank questions will tell the President what the
                                anxieties and hopes of the people really are.</p>

                            <p>In the age of the jet, the White House beat is all America. The
                                President is expected to be everywhere and the press to be there
                                with him.</p>

                                Point Barrow, Alaska, by charter plane or presidential jet. Wherever
                                the President’s plane alights, a temporary White House press room is
                                set up, on an open field, in a school room, or a hotel lobby.
                                Several times a day, stories are reported back by telephone or wire,
                                radio or TV, live or on film.</p>

                            <p>Wherever the President goes, whatever the President does, the press
                                reports and interprets. The President searches the faces for
                                support. The press tries to measure that support and detect any
                                discontent. What is the cheering for? Are they merely applauding the
                                personal warmth? The Texas smile? Or do the cheers echo real support
                                for the President’s stand on crucial issues?</p>
                            <p>In the spring of 1964, the paramount issue was the need for the
                                American Negro to obtain full civil rights. The question for Lyndon
                                Johnson was how to translate his commitment to civil rights into
                                action. Where could he expect support? How strong was the
                                opposition? How could he narrow the debate? There are many visitors.
                                Not all come to discuss civil rights, but all leave knowing his
                                concern.</p>
                            <p>The President and congressional leaders of both parties, Democratic
                                and Republican, are committed to legislative programs, though there
                                may be differences. Now, every man is made to feel that he is
                                working on the same problem. The search for support goes on.
                                Representative government is just that—it represents. There are
                                conflicts. Both sides must be heard.</p>
                            <p>The conflicts must be resolved and compromises reached. The President
                                follows the press, radio, and TV reports. His aides search out
                                information from many sources. There are many high level
                                conferences. Yet somehow, time is found to think, to add it all up.
                                Then, out of the conferences, out of the conflict of ideas, out of
                                the long nights, a further commitment.</p>
                            <p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Not from charity, not from condescension, not from
                                coercion, but from a deep commitment to justice must we open wide
                                the door of equality and invite all Americans to walk through that
                                door. The civil rights bill now before Congress is a far-reaching
                                step in the direction of equality. It may, I pray it won’t, but it
                                may take all summer. It may take sessions around the clock, but I
                                promise you, here and now, that we are going to pass a civil rights
                                bill.</p>
                            <p>MR. MORGAN: From May to July, Americans followed the progress of the
                                important legislation. The President increased his effort, using all
                                the power and prestige of his office, to secure final approval for
                                the civil rights bill in Congress.</p>
                            <p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON: This is the centennial year of Abraham Lincoln
                                freeing the slaves of their chains. But he did not free America of
                                her bigotry, or he did not free the Negro of his color. And until
                                education is unaware of race, until employment is blind to color,
                                emancipation may be a proclamation, but it is not a fact.</p>
                            <p>MR. MORGAN: In the White House, the President had made his commitment
                                known. Now, in Congress, the representatives of the people would
                                make the final decision. On July 2, 1964, the bill was passed. The
                                same evening, President Johnson would sign the bill in the presence
                                of the men of both parties who had supported it, men who had
                                accommodated differences and coaxed vision into law. The President
                                would speak to the people about the new law.</p>
                            <p>PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I am about to sign into law the Civil Rights Act
                                of 1964. I want to take this occasion to talk to you about what that
                                law means to every American. We believe that all men are entitled to
                                the blessings of liberty, yet millions are being deprived of those
                                blessings, not because of their own failures, but because of the
                                color of their skin.</p>
                            <p>The reasons are deeply embedded in history, and tradition, and the
                                nature of man. We can understand, without rancor or hatred, how this
                                all happened, but it cannot continue. Our Constitution, foundation
                                of our republic, forbids it. The principles of our freedom forbid
                                it. Morality forbids it. And the law I will sign tonight forbids
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Let us close the springs of racial poison. Let us pray for wise and
                                understanding hearts. Let us lay aside irrelevant differences and
                                make our nation whole. Let us hasten that day when our unmeasured
                                strength and our unbounded spirit will be free to do the great works

                            <p>MR. MORGAN: Tomorrow’s papers would report the details, the souvenirs
                                of the occasion. But again, the press would reach beyond these and
                                explore the underlying importance of the moment. How does this event
                                bespeak the character of this nation, her President, her people?
                                Some editorials will be critical, call it the wrong approach, too
                                strong or too mild.</p>
                            <p>But most will call it an important forward thrust in the constant
                                struggle of a nation to improve herself. Tomorrow’s news will report
                                other problems, foreign and domestic. The President and the people
                                will grapple with them together, their main conduit of communication
                                being the nation’s press and its flow of fact and opinion.</p>

                            <p>MAN: Yearender, USA, 1967. Europe [INAUDIBLE]</p>
                            <p>[CLAPPERBOARD SOUNDING]</p>
                            <p>[BEEPING]</p>
                            <p>[TYPEWRITER KEYS STRIKING]</p>
                            <p>MR. VICTOR BEASLEY: I’m Victor Beasley. On Monday, November 20, 1967,
                                near the middle of the day, the number of Americans was estimated to
                                have reached 200 million.</p>
                            <p>MR. JOHN BATCHELDER: I’m John Batchelder. Of that number, 98 million
                                were males, the other 102 million, females, which was very good news
                                for girl-watchers.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: In the past we’ve been reporting on America by means of
                                television, motion pictures, the radio, magazines, books and all the
                                means one nation uses to communicate with the others in the family
                                of man. This then is a summing-up, a quick look back to 1967 at the
                                people and events that had an effect on each of our 200 million.</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: 1967 was a good year for most Americans, and for many
                                others, too. It marked the 20th anniversary of both the Marshall
                                Plan and the Truman Doctrine. The one saw Europe build its recovery
                                from World War II with American assistance and cooperation. The
                                other gave aid to Greece and Turkey at a time of urgent need.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: Americans could look back in 1967 to 20 years of steady
                                progress to a better life, not only for themselves, but for others
                                around the world.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRA PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>Two meetings in a house named Holly Bush, in a small New Jersey town,
                                sought peaceful change in 1967. The participants: the President of
                                the United States, Lyndon Johnson, accompanied by his Secretary of
                                State, Dean Rusk, and Mr. Alexei Kosygin, the premier of the Soviet
                                Union. Both were accompanied by members of their family, as people
                                everywhere watched, and waited, and wished them well. The results,
                                hopefully a move toward a substantive agreement, a chance of mutual
                                appraisal and higher hopes, and when the talks were ended, of more
                                friendship in the future.</p>
                            <p>And, yet, maybe there was more. In August, in Switzerland, the Geneva
                                Disarmament Conference reached a new stage in efforts to stop the
                                spread of nuclear weapons. The United States and the Soviet Union
                                agreed after months of talk on the wording of a draft treaty and
                                submitted identical drafts to a 17-nation conference. America’s
                                chief negotiator, William Foster, said it indicated common concern
                                over nuclear dangers, as witnessed in UN resolutions in the past
                                five years. And so talks which began in 1962 moved closer to
                                agreement. So who can say if the spirit of Holly Bush might not have
                                done much to secure blessings of peace in 1967, and in the years to
                                come.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRA PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: A moment ago, I said American women numbered 102
                                million. 7.5 million of them are aged 20 to 24. At one time or
                                another they all have hopes of winning a beauty contest. So we give
                                them a chance, in towns, and cities, and nationwide. We chose a Miss
                                America, a Miss Potato Week, a Miss Policeman’s Ball, a Miss Most
                                Likely to Succeed in Business, and even a Miss Universe.</p>
                            <p>It’s harmless fun, and it gives the girls a chance to be queen for a
                                day or so. We even export them overseas in tougher competition.</p>
                            <p>[LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>In London, in 1967, the loveliest ladies of them all from all over
                                the world brought beauty and pleasure to those who won.</p>
                            <p>[LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>The earnest judges made up their minds, and Miss USA was only one of
                                many who lost the beauty race.</p>
                            <p>The winners: in third place, Miss Guyana; in second place, Miss
                                Argentina; and the winner, Miss Peru.</p>
                            <p>There was something for the boys, too, in 1967. The Boy Scouts, that
                                is. In August, the first World Scouting Jamboree to be held in the
                                USA was met in the state of Idaho. For Friendship was the theme of
                                the meeting, as scouts from more than 100 nations, some 15,000
                                strong, spent 10 days together in the open fields.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRAL POPS THEME PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>America’s Scouts started 57 years ago when a Chicago businessman met
                                Britain’s Sir Robert Baden Powell, whose widow attended the jamboree
                                and brought the idea back to the USA. Their aims are high—to be
                                trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient,
                                cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: But not all nations lived up to those lofty aims in
                                1967. Old resentments and new provocations combined to bring the
                                Middle East to a boil. Efforts to stop it failed. And so in June war
                                broke out between Israel and the United Arab Republic, Syria, and
                                Jordan. The rest of the world looked with apprehension.</p>
                            <p>[GENTLE WOODWIND THEME PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>In New York at the United Nations diplomats and statesmen work day
                                and night to arrange a cease-fire. By June 10, the fighting stopped,
                                but the uneasy truce was to be punctuated by sporadic outbreaks and
                                hostile acts.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Goldberg urged acceptance of President Johnson’s five
                                principles, all essential to lasting peace in the area—the right to
                                national life, an end to belligerence, free maritime passage,
                                justice for the refugees, and political independence and territorial
                                integrity for all nations.</p>
                            <p>After months of arduous negotiations, the Security Council adopted a
                                British resolution embodying those principles, and authorized the
                                appointment of a special emissary of the Secretary General who has
                                gone to the region to meet with the disputants.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRAL THEME PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>And in Vietnam, in September 1967, 83% of the Vietnamese eligible to
                                vote cast their ballots for a president, a vice president, and a
                                bicameral national parliament.</p>
                            <p>Over 100 observers of many nations reported the balloting both fair
                                and just, as Chief of State Nguyen Van Thieu won the people’s
                                support and the first national election.</p>
                            <p>Later, in October, Vice President Humphrey of the United States,
                                among other dignitaries, was on hand in Saigon for inaugural
                                celebrations.</p>
                            <p>A huge step forward toward nation building in Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>It was ironic, however, that as the South Vietnamese came closer to
                                order in their national affairs, disorder in some American cities
                                made world headlines. While the violence that occurred in 1967 was
                                not the work of most Afro-Americans, it underlined the fact that
                                despite the progress made by many Negroes, many felt left behind in
                                a time of social change. By the summer’s end, President Johnson
                                appointed a special committee to investigate the causes and possible
                                solutions to racial violence. That committee will submit its report
                                to the President early in 1968.</p>
                            <p>Americans of African descent want more opportunity and deserve it.
                                President Johnson has said the nation could afford to spend more on
                                social progress and keep his overseas commitments at the same time.
                                By the end of 1967, new programs to finance social improvements were
                                voted by the Congress, and all Americans were forcefully reminded
                                that no struggle for sweeping social and economic change has ever
                                been neat and clean.</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: Change in social matters takes many forms, not least
                                in the world of fashion. To women the world over, fashions are to
                                her a very serious matter, so they’re always alert to spot new
                                trends, new styles, new ideas, no matter, it seems, the cost.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps the greatest outside influence on American women in 1967 came
                                from Africa.</p>

                            <p>In New York, bold new designs—new to us, at least—caught the ladies’
                                eyes. Bright colors, batiks, new patterns all conspired to raise the
                                eyes of our women from New York and Paris to the offerings of
                                Africa.</p>
                            <p>And so our women watched with a gleam in their eye as Africa spoke
                                with elegance and style in the leading fashion houses.</p>
                            <p>And the sight was well worth watching.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: But while American women may have shifted their
                                attention somewhat from the fashion centers of Europe, American
                                statesmen viewed Europe with continuing close attention in 1967. In
                                two weeks of early April, Vice President Hubert Humphrey paid visits
                                to seven European capitals to discuss America’s relations with
                                Europe as a whole. The mission was meant to convey the fact that the
                                United States had not diminished its aims or attentions in support
                                of European objectives.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRAL FANFARE PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>“In Bonn and elsewhere,” he said, “our objective is but one
                                thing—progress with understanding, and cooperation and strengthening
                                of bonds.”</p>
                            <p>In October, the 15-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization moved to
                                its new headquarters in Brussels. With its 1,300 offices and 15
                                conference rooms, the building was large enough to accommodate the
                                NATO Council and the military committee, plus communications with
                                NATO capitals and NATO commands. And the United States assured its
                                continuing support to its defensive aims.</p>
                            <p>And from another quarter of the Western alliance, Australia, there
                                was another visitor to Washington. President and Mrs. Johnson were
                                host to Prime Minister Harold Holt, whose tragic death in December
                                was mourned by all the world. Prime Minister Holt was received on
                                the White House lawn with full ceremonial honors.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Holt made it clear his nation will continue to do what it can to
                                protect the integrity of South Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>In April, Konrad Adenauer died. President Johnson joined with other
                                world leaders to pay last tribute to Der Alte.</p>
                            <p>Said President Heinrich Lubke, “In strengthening friendly ties to
                                other nations, especially the United States, the Chancellor’s work
                                will continue to bear fruit.”</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: And in early December, in New York, the Family of Man
                                Award, founded in 1962, was given to the noted French economist Mr.
                                Jean Monnet, a driving force for international economic
                                cooperation.</p>
                            <p>Former American Under Secretary of State George Ball made the award
                                on behalf of the honored guests at the formal affair.</p>
                            <p>In his address, Mr. Monnet said, “World peace can be safeguarded only
                                by the formation of larger entities in the world meeting and
                                discussing problems inside common institutions, whether these
                                problems be of political, defense, or monetary policy.”</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: As the year ended on a note of triumph for Mr. Monnet,
                                we’re reminded that the year held tragedy for both the U.S. and
                                Soviet space programs. In the Soviet Union, cosmonaut Vladimir
                                Komarov became the first casualty of an actual space flight. After
                                orbiting the earth, he was killed when his spacecraft crashed.</p>
                            <p>But even earlier, during a pre-launch test on the ground, fire swept
                                through America’s Apollo rocket, and three astronauts lost their
                                lives. It was the first time America’s space program was beset by
                                loss of life. The nation mourned the tragedy.</p>
                            <p>Serious delay also threatened in the program to put men on the moon,
                                but later in the year, when the Saturn rocket was rolled out, hopes
                                revived. 36 stories tall, the work of 300,000 men and women in
                                government and industry, the unmanned mammoth raised the spirits of
                                the scientists as it rode away into space, and returned again, as it
                                will, with men aboard, hopefully in this decade.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, other probes were sent to the moon, where they sent back
                                pictures that would be useful when man first looked, as you’re
                                looking now, on a lunar landing. Brave new triumphs for machines and
                                men.</p>
                            <p>[CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PLAYING SWINGING JAZZ THEME]</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: While all this happened, people came from everywhere
                                to see what was happening to man and his world. The United States
                                and 69 other nations built impressive displays at Expo ’67 in
                                Montreal, Canada, to tell of their past, the present, and the
                                future. It was evident there that the things that unite the family
                                of man are more important than those that divide them. And as people
                                mingled and talked together, saw each other’s culture on display,
                                this world felt the smaller.</p>
                            <p>And as we caught glimpses of things to come, we wondered if we were
                                doing enough now to make this world a better place.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: In the world of commerce, 1967 saw major progress at
                                Geneva. Ever since man began to trade with one another, they have
                                disagreed over tariff, and taxes, and the movement of goods. 1967
                                was the year in which most ambitious attempts were made to knock
                                down tariff walls. After four years of negotiations, agreements were
                                reached in Geneva affecting the $40 billion a year world trade.
                                Called the Kennedy Round because of the late president’s initiative
                                to reduce trade barriers, the agreements opened the way, according
                                to President Johnson, to a new era in world commerce.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRA PLAYING MARCH]</p>
                            <p>And as a new era of commerce began, an old era of educational
                                exchange was continuing. In August the International Congress of
                                Orientalists met in its twenty-seventh assembly at the University of
                                Michigan. It was the first meeting in the United States in the
                                95-year history of the organization.</p>
                            <p>As they had met in the past, more than 1,200 experts and scholars
                                from 50 nations met to present academic papers on aspects of ancient
                                and modern Asia. They also made time to greet old friends and to
                                make new ones.</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: Millions of people in more than 100 countries hail
                                football as the world’s most popular sport. In America the game is
                                called soccer. Now our football is a roughed-up version of rugby
                                that rivals baseball as our national pastime.</p>

                            <p>So what about soccer in the USA? This year we imported whole teams
                                from overseas—Uruguay’s Cerro, England’s Stoke City, and Bangu of
                                Brazil, as the rage for soccer grew.</p>
                            <p>By the end of 1967 some 1,500 secondary schools and colleges fielded
                                soccer teams as a major sport, and two professional soccer leagues
                                now play in major American cities. Soon, American teams will enter
                                world competition.</p>
                            <p>Here’s Jim Ryun, world’s fastest runner for the one mile, 1,500 meter
                                race. And here’s the way he runs.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRA PLAYING SPIRITED THEME]</p>
                            <p>The scene is Bakersfield, California, June 1967, the 12-nation
                                Commonwealth Games. That’s Ryun on the far left in the dark jersey,
                                back of the pack. He doesn’t look like a winner here. But wait a
                                minute, on the outside, on the turn, Ryun makes his move. He was
                                third, second—the crowd senses something’s up, and they’re right.
                                Now Ryun turns it on.</p>
                            <p>And at the finish, he’s still got speed to burn, and a new world
                                record for the mile, 1,500 meters—three minutes, 51 and 1/10 seconds
                                for Jim Ryun.</p>
                            <p>Well they said the four-minute mile could never be run, and it took
                                Britain’s Roger Bannister to prove it could. And now, each year, Jim
                                Ryun keeps chipping away at the seconds. Can anybody beat him? Well
                                maybe 1968 will tell.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: Another race was run in 1967, a race against poverty,

                            <p>The scene was Punta del Este, Uruguay, where 19 chiefs of state
                                gathered in April. It was the first such meeting in 11 years, and it
                                held high promise for the people of the Americas.</p>
                            <p>The foreign ministers of the OAS—Organization of American States—had
                                prepared the way so the heads of government could take action on a
                                six-point agenda. The major goal, to increase the economic
                                integration of the hemisphere. In an atmosphere of warmth and
                                friendship, the proceedings began. The result, a call for the
                                formation of a Latin American common market, more effort to produce
                                trade earnings, and a cut in military spending.</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: In Mexico in 1968, the 17th staging of the Olympic
                                Games will attract world attention. Since their modern beginning in
                                1900 in Paris, the Games have attracted the cream of the crop of
                                athletes from more than 90 nations. 1968 will be no exception, but
                                the real contest may be man against nature to see if athletes can
                                compete normally in Mexico City’s 7,400 foot, 2,300 meter altitude,
                                and where the oxygen content of the air is 8% less than it is at sea
                                level.</p>
                            <p>[ORCHESTRA PLAYING FAST MARCH]</p>
                            <p>So two kinds of preparation were taking place in 1967. First, the
                                stadium and all the equipment necessary to the games were put in
                                order. Then in October, 2,300 athletes from 45 nations met in what
                                was called the Little Olympics, a dress rehearsal for exertions to
                                come.</p>
                            <p>Some athletes found they had no trouble at all in the high altitude,
                                but others were not so lucky. At high altitudes the wind resistance
                                is lower, and this may make for new records in some events in 1968,
                                and short distance runners depend on their anaerobic, or
                                oxygen-less, power. But some men will need special training for the
                                special conditions, and others may just give up.</p>
                            <p>Bravo.</p>
                            <p>In any case, the October Little Olympics were a testing ground for
                                men and nature, and both scored victories.</p>
                            <p>Oh well.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: In the spring of 1967, the United States Government
                                began considerations of a very sensitive nature. There was in
                                Switzerland a notable citizen of another country who had expressed
                                the desire to live, at least for a while, in the United States. She
                                was the daughter of a former chief of state, a matter of which at
                                the highest levels required the deepest thought.</p>
                            <p>[CHEERFUL ORCHESTRAL THEME PLAYING]</p>
                            <p>So in April, in New York, when a Swiss airliner came to rest, it was
                                a matter of high interest. Out of the plane stepped Svetlana
                                Alliluyeva, the only daughter and the last surviving child of
                                Russia’s Joseph Stalin.</p>
                            <p>She explained the primary reason for her leaving the Soviet Union was
                                what she termed, “unbearable restrictions on writers and
                                intellectuals.”</p>
                            <p>American officials said she would be welcome to visit the United
                                States for as long as she wished.</p>
                            <p>Asked if she would become an American citizen, she said, “I think
                                that before marriage there should be love. So if I will love this
                                country, and this country will love me, then marriage will be
                                settled, but I cannot say now.”</p>
                            <p>MR. BATCHELDER: Marriage and love—love of country and of all mankind,
                                and a lifelong happy marriage between words and images. That was the
                                proud accomplishment of the American poet Carl Sandburg, who died in
                                1967. “Time is a sandpile we run through our fingers,” he wrote,
                                “and I tell you the past is a bucket of ashes.” He was an honorable
                                and a much-honored man, a humanist, and one who probed deeply into
                                America’s past to see where it had been and where it might be going.
                                Most will remember him for his studies of Abraham Lincoln, who also
                                spoke to, for, and from the heart of his people. He was a man who
                                rubbed elbows with life and the men and women all around him who
                                lived it with him.</p>

                            <p>“Death comes once,” he wrote, “let it be easy. Ring one bell for me,
                                once. Let it go at that. Or ring no bell at all better yet.”</p>
                            <p>“This is the right place for thinking about Carl Sandburg,” said
                                President Johnson at the memorial ceremonies at the Lincoln Monument
                                in Washington.</p>
                            <p>MR. BEASLEY: That said, that was 1967. The past is prologue. We, all
                                of us, have much to do in 1968. I’m Victor Beasley.</p>
