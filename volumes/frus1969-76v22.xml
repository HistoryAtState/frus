                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>

                        Relations</hi> Series </p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the Foreign Relations series
                    that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                        >Ford</persName> administrations. The volume documents the Panama Canal
                    treaty negotiations from January 1973 until December of 1976, focusing on
                        <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName>’s efforts to create
                    a series <pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>of threshold agreements with the
                    Panamanians, based loosely on the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                    Principles of 1974. The volume also documents Congressional challenges to the
                    negotiations with the Panamanians, as well as discussions between the Department
                    of State and the Department of Defense regarding the breadth of <persName
                        corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s negotiation instructions.</p>
                <p>This volume continues the narrative regarding the Panama Canal treaty

                <p>The four compilations included in this volume provide a record of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                        >Ford</persName> administrations’ policy regarding the Panama Canal
                    Treaties, which were concluded by the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                        >Carter</persName> administration in 1977 and ratified by the Senate in
                    1978. Each compilation examines one year of the negotiations.</p>
                <p>The 1973 compilation looks at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration’s decision to resurrect the stalled negotiations with Panama,
                    after a tense session at the United Nations where Panamanian officials
                    embarrassed the United States by drawing attention to the unfinished treaties.
                    The compilation tracks the nomination of <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth
                        Bunker</persName> as chief negotiator, notes objections to the Treaty from
                    the Department of Defense and Congress, and examines the early stages of
                    negotiation between the two governments.</p>
                <p>In 1974, the United States and Panama finalized the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>
                    Principles, a series of eight statements that formed the skeleton for the
                    eventual <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>-<persName
                        corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> Treaties. Throughout the year,
                    negotiators concluded a series of threshold (draft) agreements based upon these
                    principles. Documents in this compilation focus on the myriad challenges that
                    the negotiators faced, from nationalist sentiment in Panama, to the resignation
                    of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, to continued
                    obstinacy from the Department of Defense, and to <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                        >Strom Thurmond</persName>’s Senate Resolution 301 which threatened to halt
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>By 1975, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and his team
                    had exhausted their negotiating instructions and needed President <persName
                        corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> to allow them <pb n="V" facs="0006"
                        xml:id="pg_V"/>greater flexibility with the Panamanians. Officials from the
                    Department of Defense, however, objected strenuously to reducing the duration of
                    the treaty and feared the consequences of turning the Canal (and the
                    responsibility to protect it) over to Panama too quickly. Thus, the 1975
                    compilation focuses heavily on the negotiations between State and Defense, which
                    took up most of the year and placed negotiations between the United States and
                    Panama in a holding pattern. In August, State and Defense were able to strike a
                    compromise and President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> issued
                    National Security Decision Memorandum 302, which instructed the negotiators to
                    seek a treaty that preserved U.S. control of the treaty until at least December
                    31, 1999 and “to propose to the Panamanians that the treaty <hi rend="italic"
                        >duration</hi> applicable for defense be separated from its application to
                    operation of the Canal,” mandating a minimum of 40 years for defense rights.
                    While <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 302 failed to provide enough
                    flexibility to finalize a treaty with Panama, it allowed talks to continue and
                    reduced opposition within the Department of Defense.</p>
                <p>The 1976 compilation examines treaty negotiations during an election year. With
                    President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> facing criticism about
                    his policy towards the Canal from both <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Ronald
                        Reagan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>,
                    the U.S. negotiating team proceeded slowly. The delays, however, created anxiety
                    in Panama, where economic problems, combined with the slow pace of the talks,
                    led to unrest. Several bombings in the Canal Zone, believed to be the work of
                    Panamanian Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Manuel Noreiga</persName>,
                    threatened to scuttle negotiations altogether. The defeat of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> in November only exacerbated anxieties
                    within Panama. The lobbying of <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                        Kissinger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LS_1">Sol
                    Linowitz</persName>, however, convinced the incoming <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration to embrace the treaty,
                    and the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> transition team reassured
                    the Department of State and the Panamanians that the negotiations would
                    continue, setting the stage for the ratification of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                        >Torrijos</persName> Treaties in 1978.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to time in Washington, DC.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>punctuation are
                    retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical errors
                    are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the original document are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    original text, and a list of abbreviations and terms is included in the front
                    matter of each volume. In telegrams, the telegram number (including special
                    designators such as Secto) is printed at the start of the text of the
                    telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents that were withheld
                    from release have been accounted for and are listed with headings, source notes,
                    and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place. All brackets
                    that appear in the original document are so identified in the footnotes. All
                    ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the sources of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the Foreign Relations series. The Advisory Committee
                    monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises
                    on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The
                    Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual
                    volumes in the <pb n="VII" facs="0008" xml:id="pg_VII"/>series, but it makes
                    recommendations on issues that come to its attention and reviews volumes, as it
                    deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    Review</p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 USC 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (NARA) has custody of the Nixon Presidential historical
                    materials. The requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern
                    access to the Nixon Presidential historical materials. The PRMPA and
                    implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for additional
                    restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights of former
                    Nixon White House officials, since these officials were not given the
                    opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the
                    PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA formally to notify
                    the Nixon Estate and former Nixon White House staff members that the agency is
                    scheduling for public release Nixon White House historical materials. The Nixon
                    Estate and former White House staff members have 30 days to contest the release
                    of Nixon historical materials in which they were a participant or are mentioned.
                    Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to segregate and
                    return to the creator of files private and personal materials. All Foreign
                    Relations volumes that include materials from NARA’s Nixon Presidential
                    Materials Project are processed and released in accordance with the PRMPA.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review </p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2012 and was completed in
                    2014, resulted in the decision to withhold 2 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in no documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 11 documents.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" facs="0009" xml:id="pg_VIII"/>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the Panama Canal Treaty
                    negotiations from January of 1973 to January 1977.</p>

                    Series</p>
                <p>The 1991 Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the
                    Foreign Relations series include all records needed to provide comprehensive
                    documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant U.S.
                    diplomatic activity. It also requires that government agencies, departments, and
                    other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support, cooperate with the Department of State Historian by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series have complete access to all the
                    retired records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the
                    Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at
                    the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Department’s Executive
                    Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and
                    high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President
                    and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and
                    Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic
                    posts. All the Department’s indexed central files through July 1973 have been
                    permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration at
                    College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s decentralized
                    office files covering the 1969–1976 period, which the National Archives deems
                    worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred or are in the process of
                    being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the Foreign Relations series also have full access to the papers
                    of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and other White House
                    foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dr. <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> has approved access to his
                    papers at the Library of Congress. The papers are a key source for the <persName

                        >Ford</persName> subseries of Foreign Relations.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume was completed through special access to restricted
                    documents at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project, the Library of Congress,
                    and other agencies. While all the material printed in <pb n="XII" facs="0013"
                        xml:id="pg_XII"/>this volume has been declassified, some of it is extracted
                    from still classified documents. In the time since the research for this volume
                    was completed, the Nixon Presidential Materials have been transferred to the
                    Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. The Nixon
                    Presidential Library staff is processing and declassifying many of the documents
                    used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time
                    of publication.</p>

                    1969–1976, Volume XXII</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records in the Nixon Presidential Materials and the Gerald
                    Ford Presidential Library. The presidential papers of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                        >Ford</persName> administrations are an excellent source of high-level
                    decision-making documentation for U.S.-Panamanian relations from 1973 to 1976.
                    The bulk of the foreign policy records in the Nixon Presidential Materials are
                    in the Country Files and Latin American Central Files. The bulk of the foreign
                    policy records at the Gerald Ford Presidential Library are in the Presidential
                    Country Files for Latin America, as well as the Vice Presidential Papers. At
                    both archives, the Institutional Files (H-Files) contain the records of many
                    important meetings documented in this volume. All of these records provided a
                    glimpse into the evolution of the Treaty negotiations from the point of view of
                    the White House.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State are another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain cable traffic concerning the progress of the
                    negotiations regarding the Panama Canal Treaties, including summaries drafted by
                    the negotiators. Important documents can also be found in the Department’s lot
                    files, particularly within the correspondence of <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                        >Ellsworth Bunker</persName> (78D300), which provide an impeccably-organized
                    collection of records, including memoranda of conversation, private notes, and
                    papers outlining strategies regarding approaches to Congress, the Department of
                    Defense, and the Panamanians. Another valuable lot file contains the transcripts
                    of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s staff meetings
                    (78D443), in which top-ranking Department of State officials expressed candid
                    views about <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, <persName
                        corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, and the negotiations as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense. The records of the Office of the Secretary of Defense delineate <gloss
                        target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>’s changing attitude toward the negotiations.
                    The records of the Panama Canal Company, located at Archives II in Record Group
                    185, contain a series of cables from the Governor of the Panama Canal Zone.
                    Records at the Central Intelligence Agency, especially within the Executive
                    Registry files, include a number of valuable intelligence reports about
                        <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, the negotiations, and the
                    bombings in the Canal Zone.</p>

                        >Jorden</persName>’s account and the documentation, especially in regard to
                    State-Defense negotiations in 1975.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi

                            >Torrijos</persName> To Take Military Action Against Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>1. Former Ambassador Jack Vaughn, who arrived here last night from Panama,
                        informs us that yesterday morning at 11 o’clock he received a call from
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> saying that he would
                        send his personal helicopter to pick up Vaughn in the next 32 minutes and
                        take him to <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ country
                        residence. This was done.</p>
                    <p>2. Vaughn reports that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> had
                        told him “he had just about had it” so far as the Americans were concerned.
                        The General said that negotiations had been going on between Panama and the
                        United States for nine long years and that the Americans were far more
                        “hawkish toward Panama than the most diehard hawks were toward
                            Vietnam.”<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">For a different perspective on the
                            U.S.-Panamanian treaty negotiations, see <ref
                                target="frus1969-76ve10#d563"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                Republics, 1969–1972, Document 563</ref>. The Intelligence
                            Memorandum suggests that the 1972 negotiations stalled in part because
                            “General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> was unwilling
                            to commit himself on substantive issues or allow the talks to move from
                            an exploratory to a bargaining phase.”</note> He characterized the
                        American inhabitants of the Zone as being in the diehard category.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> went on to say that he
                        had two elite battalions ready for military deployment against the Canal
                        Zone.</p>
                    <p>4. Obviously <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> wanted this
                        word to reach US authorities but Vaughn apparently did not have time before
                        his departure from Panama to get in touch with our Embassy nor apparently

                        <p>After an encouraging start in mid-1971 followed by a year of relative
                            inactivity, the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations retrogressed when the
                            Panamanians presented to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1"
                                >Anderson</persName> their detailed position during their December
                            4–6, 1972 meeting in Panama City. The Panamanian position is less
                            forthcoming and more inflexible than the position Panama presented in
                            January 1971 and reveals a wide gap between us on almost all points (a
                            comparison of positions is attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">For an

                            Panama’s position is negotiable, the substantive differences and the

                            the disparity unbridgeable under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>On December 12, Panama took the unprecedented step of publicizing both
                            its and the U.S. negotiating positions.<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5"

                                Panamanian Foreign Ministry adviser, disclosed the U.S. negotiating
                                position in a public speech, stating: “The United States has
                                proposed as the term of the duration of the treaty on the locks
                                canal a period of 50 years which would be extended to 85 years if a
                                third set of locks were to be constructed and to 90 years if a
                                sea-level canal were built.” (Jeremiah O’Leary, “Bare U.S., Panama

                                xml:id="pg_3"/>to pursue its quest for full independence by
                            continuing to seek to elicit public and international support for the
                            elimination of the “U.S. colonial and military enclaves in its
                            territory,” the next occasion being at the U.N. Security Council meeting
                            to be held in mid-March in Panama. The anachronistic terms of the 1903
                            Convention together with our prominent military presence in Panama
                            render us vulnerable. A complicating factor is that relations between
                            Canal Zone agencies and the Panamanian Government, which have been
                            brittle for years, have deteriorated to the point where there is almost
                            no communication between the heads of these agencies and top Panamanian
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>Failure to achieve some substantive improvement soon in its canal treaty
                            relations will probably force Panama to take further actions (which
                            could end in violence) designed to dramatize its situation and to
                            pressure us into meeting its terms. Were we to offer to make a few
                            significant changes in our extra-territorial rights and military
                            presence in Panama without awaiting conclusion of a new treaty, while
                            continuing treaty negotiations on other issues, we would relieve
                            pressure in Panama and improve our posture with the international
                            community, without adversely affecting our ability to operate and defend
                            the Canal or without materially impairing our bargaining position.</p>
                        <p>Three changes should be made now which would help achieve these
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Elimination of Extraterritoriality</hi></p>
                        <p>The 1903 Treaty allows the U.S. to exercise criminal and civil
                            jurisdiction over Panamanians, third-country nations and private
                            business in the Zone—the major remaining case where one nation holds
                            extraterritorial rights in perpetuity in another’s territory. Perhaps no
                            other treaty right so infuriates Panama as our jurisdiction over its
                            nationals. We should obtain authorization from the Congress to conclude
                            and put into effect an agreement to transfer to Panama civil and
                            criminal jurisdiction over Panamanians and third country nationals as
                            well as civil jurisdiction over private businesses and organizations in
                            the Canal Zone. Panama in turn should agree to prosecute Panamanians and
                            third country nationals who commit offenses in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Transfer of the Southern Command (<gloss
                                    target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss>) from Panama</hi></p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has repeatedly
                            requested that <gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss> be removed
                            from Panama because he finds such an imposing U.S. military presence
                            politically difficult to accept and almost impossible to deal with on
                            matters relating to defense of the canal, because the rank structure is
                            so disproportionate and the Command is such a large structure compared
                            to the Guardia Nacional. In addition, Panama argues that military
                            activities in the Canal Zone unrelated to canal defense are not
                            authorized by the 1903 Convention and violate the treaty requirement
                            that the Canal “shall be neutral in perpetuity”. <pb n="4" facs="0029"
                                xml:id="pg_4"/>Although we have not accepted this position it would
                            be persuasive to large segments of world opinion. Transfer of <gloss
                                target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss> to the U.S., while retaining
                            the successful military schools in the Canal Zone, would be welcomed by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, would create
                            a more propitious climate for treaty negotiations, would continue to
                            enable us to respond to requests for assistance from Latin American
                            nations, and would not impair our military position with respect to
                            canal defense.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Demilitarization of the Canal Zone Government and
                                Panama Canal Company</hi></p>
                        <p>Traditionally, the Corps of Engineers has furnished the President of the
                            Canal Company (who is also the Governor) and runs the canal. A Canal
                            Zone government headed by a U.S. general officer responsive to the
                            Department of Defense is regarded by the Panamanians as an offensive
                            symbol of colonialism which tends to perpetuate itself. The key
                            objective in the Panamanian position is the complete elimination of the
                            Canal Zone Government. This should only be accomplished in a new treaty,
                            but we can reduce the tensions and improve communications if the
                            Governor is a civilian and the canal operates under the civilian
                            administration of the Department of Transportation which already has the
                            St. Lawrence Seaway. The Congress already handles the budgetary aspects
                            of the canal in the Transportation Subcommittees of the Appropriations
                            Committees. There is no legal impediment to the appointment of a
                            civilian as President of the Canal Company to act also as Governor.
                            Transfer of the Canal agencies to the Department of Transportation
                            would, however, probably require Congressional acquiescence in a
                            reorganization plan.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Duration.</hi> In response to our position to drop
                            perpetuity and operate the lock canal for fifty years and a sea-level
                            canal for forty additional years, Panama offers 22 years on the lock
                            canal and a willingness to negotiate a sea-level canal.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Jurisdiction.</hi> In reply to our offer to return
                            most criminal and civil jurisdiction in 15 years, Panama wants immediate
                            jurisdiction over <pb n="5" facs="0030" xml:id="pg_5"/>Panamanians and
                            over all Americans within five years. Panama also wants jurisdiction on
                            military bases.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Administration.</hi> We are seeking almost 100
                            percent control over the Canal administration as a U.S. agency but
                            Panama wants effective participation in canal operation including
                            control over labor relations.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Land and Water.</hi> We are willing to return about
                            30 percent of the land and establish a joint system for identifying
                            additional areas for Panamanian use under U.S. control, but Panama wants
                            it all returned and will then designate areas in the treaty for U.S.
                            use.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Defense.</hi> We want to retain the decisive voice
                            on defense but Panama wants primary responsibility for protecting the
                            lock canal in peacetime and proposes joint agreement on defense measures
                            in time of war. Panama is willing to accept a U.S. role for protection
                            of the lock canal but wants no U.S. forces to defend a sea-level
                            canal.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Neutrality.</hi> Panama wants effective neutrality
                            of the canal endorsed by the U.N. but established and controlled by
                            Panama including the decision whether U.S. forces may be used to enforce
                            it. It also insists that <gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss>
                            be removed since it considers its presence a violation of the 1903
                            Convention. We wish to continue to be able to deny use of the canal to
                            an enemy in time of war.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Flags.</hi> Panama wants no flags in the Canal Zone
                            or on bases except the Panamanian flag.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Compensation.</hi> We have offered a formula similar
                            to that of 1967, which would give Panama about $25 million annually. We
                            understand that Panama wants substantially more based upon a 200 percent
                            toll increase and 50 percent of gross revenues.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Expansion.</hi> The only advance in the Panamanian
                            position over the past was an expression of willingness to grant a
                            concession for a sea-level canal if the U.S. decided within five years
                            to build it where the present canal is now located.</p>

                        relations on a somewhat new footing. He described it as a “new chapter” and
                        “a new beginning.” The fact that the White House, and specifically Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, saw fit to send
                        someone down especially to talk with him had considerable impact. He said he
                        had great difficulty dealing with “lawyers, diplomats and Zonians.” He could
                        not get through to them and they could not understand him. He said it was a
                        pleasure at last to be able to talk to an American who could understand his
                        problems and also describe U.S. attitudes clearly and candidly, but without
                        threats or double-talk. He would warmly welcome a <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> visit to Panama at any time.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">central items that emerged</hi> from our talks were
                        these:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">On the Canal Treaty:</hi> He has no faith in the ability of
                        our negotiators or his to reach an agreement in any reasonable time frame.
                        He wishes both sides could change their personnel and their attitudes.
                        However, he is willing to let the traditional negotiating process continue
                        pretty much as it has been if that is what we wish. He recognizes that it
                            <pb n="7" facs="0032" xml:id="pg_7"/>probably will not be possible to
                        reach agreement soon on the “big questions.” By these he meant—transfer of
                        jurisdiction, duration of a new treaty, the sea level canal option, etc.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, he believes it possible to make progress on other issues that
                        divide us. He gave me a list of 12 items—attached at Tab C—that he thinks we
                        can settle one-by-one and thus provide the clear impression of forward
                            movement.<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">Tab C, undated, is attached but not
                            printed. Some of the proposed unilateral actions included returning the
                            Old France Field airport, permitting the sale of lottery tickets in the
                            Canal Zone, allowing Panamanian police partial jurisdiction in the Canal
                            Zone, and the establishment of equal wages for all workers within the
                            Canal Zone.</note> He needs that to keep a rein on those from whom he
                        gets the most pressure for drastic action—the students, intellectuals and
                        “left-wingers” in his government. He said he was not worried about them—<hi
                            rend="italic">if</hi> he can demonstrate slow but steady progress.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, one of the items on his list—removal of the cyclone fence
                        separating the Zone from Panama—was accomplished two days after I left
                        Panama. Another—the right to fly the Panamanian flag on ships transiting the
                        Canal—is being accomplished this week.</p>
                    <p>What <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> wants, in short, is a
                        parallel track approach—with traditional negotiations proceeding in their
                        desultory way, while we move ahead on specifics. He said he would feel
                        better if he knew that I was taking a personal role in the second track. I
                        told him I would be watching it carefully and would stay in close touch with
                        his Ambassador here. It is apparent that he is fearful, based on past
                        experience, that if this process gets bogged down in the bureaucratic swamp,
                        little or nothing will happen.</p>
                    <p>On the <hi rend="italic">UN Security Council meeting</hi> in Panama
                        (beginning March 15)—<persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        assured me flatly that “there will be no violence, no riots.” He also
                        promised to tone down any anti-American themes in the Panamanian media. (We
                        have intelligence reports that he is doing this.)<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6"
                            >In telegram 549 from Panama City, February 2, the Embassy reported on
                            the potential of Panamanian grandstanding at the Security Council

                    <p>He said that Panama wants the meeting to be a success and that it will not be
                        if it turns into an anti-American outburst.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> intends to open the
                        proceedings with a speech of welcome. In it, he said, he would “set the
                        tone” calling for serious and thoughtful discussion of serious problems. He
                        will point out that this is not an appropriate forum for invective and wild
                        rhetoric. He said he thought that if he, as the host, set that opening tone,
                        the others, or most of them, would follow his lead. He will, of course,
                        mention the Canal and Panama’s feelings but we can live with that.</p>
                    <pb n="8" facs="0033" xml:id="pg_8"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ approach is clearly more
                        reasonable and responsible than that of his Ambassador to the UN who has
                        been charging around depicting the coming meeting as a chance to mobilize
                        world opinion against the U.S. We have indications that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has already told him to lower
                        the noise level.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> also told me that Castro
                        would not be attending the meeting and he expected Foreign Minister Roa to
                        represent Cuba.</p>
                    <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> that if the UN
                        meeting turned into an “anti-American donnybrook” it would do three
                        things:</p>
                    <p>—lower Panama’s prestige;</p>
                    <p>—weaken the UN system;</p>
                    <p>—put out of business for some time those of us who want to deal seriously
                        with U.S.-Panama problems.</p>
                    <p>He said he understood and agreed. Those were things he did not want to
                        happen.</p>

                            xml:id="d3fn7">Villa, an American citizen, had been imprisoned in Cuba

                        “all possible” to secure his release from jail in Cuba. I knew he was
                        concerned that Villa was a CIA operative, and assured him this was not true.
                        Our interest was purely humanitarian.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said he felt that he had
                        been “double-crossed” by Castro. First, he had given assurances that the
                        boats <hi rend="italic">and</hi> men would be released to Panama and he then
                        had provided only the boats. Second, he pledged that the boats were in “good
                        condition” then they almost sank one day out of Havana and had to be towed
                        back to port. I told <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> we
                        had both been double-crossed.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said he had no faith in
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Romulo Escobar Betancourt</persName>,
                        Rector of Panama University, who had been negotiating with the Cubans. He
                        could not be sure that <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>
                        stated Panama’s case clearly, or that he reported accurately to <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> on his talks in Havana. What he
                        wanted to do, he said, was to send his G–2, Lt. Col. <persName
                            corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName>, to Havana. He could be sure
                            <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName> would convey his
                        feelings accurately—and that he would get an accurate report back. But “some
                        of your people” had warned <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName>
                        not to have anything to do with the Cubans. If he did, he would be tarred as
                        a “communist” and it would affect his relations with us.</p>
                    <p>I gave <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> my personal
                        assurance this was not true and would not happen. If <persName
                            corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName> could get Villa out of Havana, we
                        would be <pb n="9" facs="0034" xml:id="pg_9"/>grateful and I would guess
                        that it would improve, not damage, our relations with him. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said he would take my word and

                    </list>
                    <p>You may be interested in information we have been receiving since my return
                        from Panama which indicates that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>’ reaction to my visit and to my discussions with
                        him has been very positive. He apparently feels that a new chapter has been
                        opened in US-Panamanian relations and his reported statements and actions
                        over the past two weeks tend to reflect his positive mood.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the highlights of reports [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                            line not declassified</hi>]:</p>
                    <p>—<persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> believes that his talks
                        with me serve as a departure point for a new line of action on the canal
                        treaty negotiations and he now thinks the negotiations will be renewed.</p>
                    <p>—He has instructed Panamanian journalists not to publish any articles which
                        are provocative or anti-United States before the UNSC meeting. Any articles
                        about which there is any doubt should first be cleared with the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>—He has directed the National Guard and the Panama police to insure that
                        there are no attempts to manufacture adverse propaganda against canal zone
                        residents and no contrived incidents designed to embarrass the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>—He has commented in private that he was very pleased by the visit of “the
                        representative of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> ”
                        which he believes “has advanced relations between Panama and the US by sixty
                        years”.</p>
                    <p>—While he thinks that all Canal Zone facilities and installations could be
                        turned over to Panama in five years, he is now inclined to consider
                        favorably the acceptance of a ten-year schedule, “if he and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> were allowed to work out
                        the basic framework of a new canal treaty”.</p>
                    <p>—He is also reported to have expressed his confidence that many of the
                        problems between Panama and the US could be resolved if <pb n="11"
                            facs="0036" xml:id="pg_11"/>direct communications could be maintained
                        between himself and the White House.</p>
                    <p>—He has instructed his Foreign Minister to be extremely diplomatic in his
                        dealings with the US and to avoid antagonizing the United States whenever
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>—He has told associates that his speech at the opening session of the
                        Security Council must be designed to set a “moderate tone for the entire
                        UNSC meeting”. While he must present Panama’s position regarding the Canal
                        issue, he wants to avoid establishing the framework for a series of attacks
                        against the US by delegates of other countries attending the UNSC
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>—He is also reported to have personally told a group of journalists that it
                        is not in the best interest of Panama to antagonize the US without reason at
                        this time.</p>
                    <p>—Captain Villa has been released and is now in Panama following a short trip
                        to Havana last week by <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’
                        personal emissary, Lt. Col. <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1"
                        >Noriega</persName>.</p>
                    <p>—Indications from our Embassy in Panama and from a Latin American diplomat at
                        the United Nations are that Panama has moderated its position on the
                        resolution to be presented to the Security Council concerning the US-Panama
                        “conflict”.</p>
                    <p>—The leading communist labor leader in Panama is reliably reported to have
                        told labor leaders on February 25 that there will be no demonstrations
                        during the UNSC meeting.</p>
                    <p>—The Panamanian Government has agreed to the Embassy suggestion that the
                        invitation to the members of the UNSC to visit the Canal installations be
                        issued jointly by Panama and the US.</p>

                    </opener>
                    <p>I last wrote you on March 20, 1972 concerning the negotiations with the
                        Republic of Panama.<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2"><persName corresp="#p_ARB_1"
                                >Anderson</persName>’s March 20, 1972, letter was forwarded to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> under a March 28
                            covering memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1">Haig</persName>.
                            (National Archives, Nixon Presidential Materials, <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Files, Box 791, Country Files, Latin
                            America, Panama, Vol. 3, January 1972–August 1974) </note></p>
                    <p>As you know, the meeting of the United Nations Security Council has been
                        scheduled to take place in Panama this month. We will undoubtedly be charged
                        with maintaining a “colonial enclave” within the Republic of Panama based
                        upon our Treaty of 1903 and the subsequent amendments.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that a great many aspects of the canal treaty negotiations will be
                        discussed at the Security Council meeting either directly or implicitly.
                        Under these circumstances I felt we should advise you of where we stand in
                        the negotiations and what we may look forward to.</p>
                    <p>During 1972, we repeatedly expressed to Panama our willingness to negotiate,
                        our flexibility, and urged that they respond to our detailed proposals of
                        1971. Not until December did they do so, and they then delivered an
                        uncompromising statement of position which wiped out almost all of the
                        progress of 1971.<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">See <ref target="#d1fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 1</ref>.</note> For your convenience, I am
                        attaching a copy of their December proposals to us; also our reply to
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d5fn4">Neither is attached. Regarding the December negotiations,

                    <p>During the year 1972, neither General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> nor Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName>, nor the negotiators, evidenced any disposition to
                        compromise our differences. As you will see from their statement in
                        December, they have taken a position far beyond the guidelines within which
                        you have instructed us to negotiate.</p>
                    <p>At various times during 1972, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George
                            Bush</persName> and I met with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1"
                            >Boyd</persName> and other Latin representatives to the United Nations,
                        endeavoring to point out to them that a meeting of the United Nations
                        Security Council in Panama could very well be detrimental rather than
                        helpful to the negotiating process. This position was not <pb n="13"
                            facs="0038" xml:id="pg_13"/>accepted by Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>; hence the scheduled meeting of the
                        United Nations Security Council.</p>
                    <p>It is quite clear that our current offer is not acceptable to General
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and the Panamanian
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The actions of Panama, including their insistence upon a meeting of the
                        United Nations Security Council in Panama and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ expressed desire to negotiate
                        directly with you or your close advisors, indicate a desire for much greater
                        concessions than we have considered it wise to offer or for concessions
                        which do not fall within the terms of your guidelines to the
                        negotiators.</p>
                    <p>For your information, the essential differences between the formally stated
                        United States and Panamanian positions at this time are as follows:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Duration</p>
                    <p>Panama wants U.S. control of the lock canal to terminate in 1994, about
                        thirty years sooner than you have specified, and it offers no additional
                        duration for the treaty if a sea level canal were built or a third lane of
                        locks were added to the existing canal. It is most unlikely that Panama
                        would accept anything near our proposal of an additional thirty-five years
                        for third locks and forty years for a sea level canal.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Zone and Canal Operation</p>
                    <p>Under the Panamanian formula, the Zone would disappear within five years and
                        the only land allotted to the United States would be very limited,
                        non-contiguous, operating and defense areas. The United States could
                        conduct, with some undefined but limited Panamanian participation, the
                        functions strictly necessary for operation of the lock canal. Governmental
                        functions would not be performed by the United States. There would be
                        significantly greater and more high level Panamanian employment in the canal
                        operation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Flexibility on the Canal Zone and Canal
                        Operations</p>
                    <p>Our current offer would permit Panama gradually to assume almost all
                        significant governmental functions in the area.</p>
                    <p>We have repeatedly suggested to Panama that we would be willing to eliminate
                        the Zone as such, change its character, and redesignate it as the Canal
                        Area. We have indicated our willingness to allow Panama, over a period of
                        time, to assume almost all of the significant governmental functions in the
                        area. We have, however, reserved certain rights, which I will outline
                        further in this letter, which we consider important to the control and the
                        defense of the canal throughout the duration of the treaty. These rights on
                        the part of the United States lessen the full and complete exercise of
                        rights of Panama within the area.</p>
                    <pb n="14" facs="0039" xml:id="pg_14"/>
                    <p>We have a fundamental difference with Panama as to what we need for control
                        and defense. Under their concept, we would have only a small amount of land
                        around each of the operating installations. For the defense of the canal we
                        would be required to have some consultations with Panamanian military
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Under our concept for defense, we need to maintain areas of land along the
                        entire length of the canal and to have an absolute right of defense,
                        including the right to restore civil order therein should this be
                        required.</p>
                    <p>We doubt that any foreign power at the present moment is likely to go in and
                        challenge our rights in the canal, although we should have the necessary
                        rights and defense structure to deal with such a situation. We believe it is
                        much more likely that if any disorders arise they will arise because of
                        radical groups in Panama and not from external powers. We therefore consider
                        it quite necessary that our forces have an unimpaired defense
                        capability.</p>
                    <p>We also believe it is necessary for us to regulate shipping in the canal,
                        which would preclude Panamanian interference with any transitting
                        vessels.</p>
                    <p>They would like us to surrender all of the land in the present Canal Zone and
                        they would in turn give us permission as they see fit to use certain
                        portions of the land. On the other hand, we have taken the position that we
                        should retain control of land use in the canal area but by agreement with
                        Panama determine the nature of the uses to which the land is to be put and
                        arrange such uses by a joint commission. Under our current proposal the
                        total area of the canal area would be reduced by about twenty-five
                        percent.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Financial Benefits</p>
                    <p>While we have not negotiated any specific numbers with the current Panamanian
                        Government, it is obvious that they demand much more than the annual royalty
                        based on tonnage that was offered in the 1967 draft treaty and which is
                        currently offered.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, we pay to Panama an annual sum of approximately $2
                        million. If the terms of the 1967 drafts were used, the annual payments to
                        Panama would be approximately $25 million at current traffic rates.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss></p>
                    <p>Panama wishes to reduce the United States military presence in the canal
                        area, have <gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss> removed, and limit
                        United States military activities strictly to canal defense.</p>
                    <p>As I have indicated above, Panama wants full responsibility for the
                        protection of the canal area from civil disorders and a significant <pb
                            n="15" facs="0040" xml:id="pg_15"/>role in the defense of the canal from
                        outside military attack. I have already outlined to you our thoughts on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Expansion</p>
                    <p>Panama does not reject the idea of a sea level canal or a third lane of locks
                        for the existing canal. They do insist, however, that our right to build a
                        sea level canal or third locks would lapse after five years, which is much
                        too early for it to be of any value to us. Nor have they given us a clear
                        idea of their terms for a new sea level canal.</p>
                    <p>In sum, it is evident that there is a large gap between our two positions.
                        Certain additional concessions could be made without appreciably affecting
                        control and defense of the canal or changing our chances of Congressional
                        approval, but I am afraid they would not do much to close the gap.</p>
                    <p>To satisfy Panama at this time it appears that we would be required to move
                        fairly close to Panama’s position.</p>
                    <p>Should we do so, this would mean the termination of the United States
                        presence in the early part of the 21st century and would certainly deny us a
                        sufficient period to cover the cost of expanding canal capacity, whether by
                        third locks or by building a sea level canal.</p>
                    <p>I know, Sir, that you are aware of the problem of Congressional approval.
                        Today it is serious even at the present level of concessions. If we were to
                        go far enough to satisfy Panama, it might become impossible to secure Senate
                        approval of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has acknowledged to
                        me and others that it would be most difficult to close the gap at this time.
                        He is under the impression that if Panama continues its agitation the United
                        States will move toward his position regarding the treaty.</p>
                    <p>He seems to be under the impression that we, as negotiators, take a much
                        harder line than other of your advisors and has therefore, on occasions in
                        the past, suggested meeting with others than the negotiators.</p>
                    <p>My own feeling is that he is not really prepared to discuss specific items or
                        to negotiate with regard to specific positions, but rather with a very broad
                        brush would propose to eliminate most of the American presence and be
                        enabled to say to his country that he had completely abrogated the
                        provisions of the 1903 Treaty.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that we have the following options:</p>
                    <p>1. We can continue to hope that a general treaty will be written encompassing
                        the changes which we believe should be made in our relationships under the
                        Treaty of 1903 and in accordance with the guidelines which you have given us
                        or which you elect to give us in the future.</p>
                    <pb n="16" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_16"/>
                    <p>This general treaty would also include our rights concerning a new sealevel
                        canal or the construction of third locks for canal expansion. Such a treaty
                        should as well define our military rights in the canal area.</p>
                    <p>It would seem to me that there is little hope for believing that this could
                        be accomplished in the near future unless we move very substantially from
                        our position toward the Panamanian position.</p>
                    <p>2. We could decide that there is little immediate hope of a comprehensive
                        treaty and therefore elect to give to Panama various rights and properties
                        in order to maintain a more harmonious relationship and blunt the thrust of
                        criticism of our posture in Panama. We would be giving up some of our
                        bargaining points, but we would have many left and if we are not going to
                        have a completely comprehensive treaty this is not a disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>We could, for example, return certain lands and installations largely unused
                        by the United States but vital to Panama’s urban expansion.</p>
                    <p>It could be desirable to allow Panamanian commercial development and activity
                        in certain parts of the canal area free of the United States Minimum Wage
                        Law.</p>
                    <p>We could make changes in jurisdiction and significantly lessen the police and
                        juridical presence of the United States in the area.</p>
                    <p>These changes would require hard work in Congress but are probably overdue in
                        the sense that they are of small significance to us and could be very
                        helpful in our posture in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>3. Negotiations should continue under any of the two choices above simply
                        because I believe it is in our national interest to indicate that we do not
                        want to be looked upon as trying to maintain what could be regarded as a
                        “colonial enclave” in another country.</p>
                    <p>All of the problems of change in the area are complicated. It would be my
                        recommendation, Mr. President, that after the Security Council meeting I
                        should meet with the members of the Under Secretaries Committee to evaluate
                        the situation and, if the Committee agrees that negotiations are not likely
                        to bear fruit in the near future, we develop a program for legislative and
                        other forms of action in regard to the canal operation.</p>

                        consult regularly with the Departments of State and Defense, and their

                            City, March 19, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Scali</persName>, who was in
                            Panama for the Security Council meeting, reported his concerns about a
                            “potentially explosive” confrontation with the Panamanians at the
                            meeting, which began on March 15. He stated: “It now seems likely I will
                            have to veto <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> resolution if it proves
                            impossible tomorrow to work out reasonable language with the

                    <p>1. In 1½ hour conversation with Gen <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> today, I found him extremely tense and seemingly
                        close to limit of frustration. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> never relaxed, although I believe I achieved some
                        personal rapport and he seemed to appreciate fact that White House directly
                        interested in successful outcome of our bilateral negotiations and prepared
                        to make generous concessions. He professed to believe that I was sincere in
                        wanting new agreement and said he accepted fact that US does not have
                        colonial attitude even though his students don’t believe it. He cited
                        generous return of Okinawa to Japan and said this made Panamanians resentful
                        US not making adjustments here to meet 70 years of Panamanian striving to
                        remedy unjust situation.</p>
                    <p>2. He said he has held Panama in check for four years without single tear gas
                        cartridge being expended, despite at least five dates a year which formerly
                        caused demonstrations with property damage in <pb n="18" facs="0043"
                            xml:id="pg_18"/>both Canal Zone and Panama. US has never even noticed
                        these four years of peace and, significantly in his opinion, there has never
                        been shown slightest appreciation to him for his efforts. US complains about
                        fiery rhetoric on Panamanian radio, but he considers he is protecting Canal
                        by allowing an escape valve of words to take place of rocks and violence.
                        His is peace with freedom, rather than peace of Papa Doc variety. He
                        considers he is governing most nationalistic people in LA, not because they
                        are the bravest but because Panama has borders in all four directions and in
                        its center as well.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> asserted 200,000
                        Panamanians ready two years ago to go into Canal Zone and “sacrifice
                        themselves” in confrontation with US. He barely prevented violence by
                        telling people he would negotiate Panamanian rights and equalize treaty
                        arrangements. Now two years later Panamanians treated worse than ever. They
                        have lost faith in negots. He must have concrete action from US. Small
                        things happen every day that show Canal Zone condescension and mistreatment
                        of Panamanians such as arrests by Canal Zone police for minor infractions.
                        It is the small daily incidents that “could be detonator of explosive
                        crisis”. Lack of results makes him a liar to his people. He noted tersely
                        that he is very much afraid of what may happen next Jan 9 which 10 year

                        He described Governor as “colonialist by conviction” and went on at length.

                        seems to have a policy of sending insensitive men as governors and
                        negotiators in order to ensure lack of results. He said it was as though he
                        had sent the head of Panama’s Communist Party to negotiate with US.</p>

                        no doubt Panama has solid sympathy from them in simplistic oratory about

                    <p>The Security Council meeting has ended with the U.S. vetoing a tendentious
                        and unbalanced declaration on Latin America in general and Panama in
                        particular. Vote was 13 for, one against, and one abstention (U.K.).</p>
                    <p>Until a few hours before end of the session, our delegation had worked out
                        with Panama, with helpful intervention of others—especially France, Britain,
                        Australia, an innocuous compromise on which there was agreement except for
                        five words. Then, in final hours, Panama reversed course and went back to
                        earlier unacceptable resolution.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">In telegram 1563

                            making progress on language for the resolution. (Ibid.) In telegram 1582
                            from Panama, however, <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName>
                            informed the Department that there was more than a five-word discrepancy
                            in the two sides’ drafts, and that the lead Panamanian negotiator,
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>, had
                            retreated to an earlier position. (Ibid.)</note> They were undoubtedly
                        encouraged to do so by Cuba, Peru, Chile and others, with full backing of

                    <p>Highlights of meetings which began March 15—with two-day break March
                        17–18:</p>
                    <p>Panamanian leader General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        opened first session with welcoming speech that was rigid and polemical. His
                        earlier intention to open on a “moderate” note was changed at last
                        minute—within 24 hours of opening—under pressure from extremists in the UN
                        and in his own entourage. His main pitch was for world recognition of
                        Panamanian sovereignty over all its territory—meaning the Canal and Canal
                        Zone. He also attacked “isolation” of Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Mexican Foreign Secretary Rabasa, who spoke on afternoon of first day, noted
                        his country’s support for holding of meeting in Panama. He noted Mexican
                        support for “right of peoples to determine their own destiny without
                        intervention, coercion, or external pressure” and upheld national unity and
                        territorial integrity of all states. Praised creation of Latin American
                        nuclear-free zone. He spoke sympathetically <pb n="21" facs="0046"
                            xml:id="pg_21"/>of Panama’s concerns and interests and urged U.S. and
                        Panama to work out settlement by mutual agreement. He attacked perpetuity of
                        present treaty “especially when upon one of the parties is imposed all or
                        almost all of the burdens and the other receives all the benefits.” In
                        comparison with many others, Rabasa’s was moderate statement—but still not
                        very helpful. He will, of course, claim otherwise. He left Panama after
                        formal opening statements of first two days. There is no evidence that
                        Mexican delegation played any significant role behind the scenes in ensuing
                        days to press for moderate resolution or to push Panama either way.</p>
                    <p>Speech of Cuba’s Raul Roa attracted most attention on first day. It was
                        typical Cuban invective with polemical attack on U.S. and all its actions,
                        the kind of thing we have become accustomed to at the UN and in all other
                        forums. There was considerable criticism in the corridors and even among
                        Panamanian circles of the sour note sounded by the Cuban delegate.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Scali</persName> immediately responded with a
                        short and moderate statement that chided Cubans for reverting to outmoded
                        Cold War rhetoric that was inappropriate in view of changing world.
                        Statement won plaudits from most delegations, including Panamanians—in
                        private.</p>
                    <p>As meetings wore on, we made some tactical mistakes. I think we moved away
                        too fast from our initial position of urging there be no repeat no
                        resolution of any kind at the meeting. We went to our “fallback” resolution
                        too fast. And we failed to win broad enough support for that approach. We
                        also probably underestimated the sympathy and support that would go to tiny
                        Panama in its dispute with the Colossus of the North.</p>
                    <p>We were absolutely right to veto the final resolution—which engaged the UN in
                        a strictly bilateral issue and would have seriously prejudiced future
                            negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d7fn3">For the texts of <persName

                            situation.</hi> The nationalistic <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> regime represents a change not only of degree but
                        of kind. Nationalistic sloganeering about the canal and our presence here is
                        nothing new in Panama. What is new is a regime that is determined to make
                        good on its sloganeering both domestically and in its canal treaty relations
                        with us. Having put its domestic political house more or less in order, it
                        has now made the readjustment of its relationship with the U.S. its highest
                        priority.</p>
                    <p>Our canal presence, of course, rests ultimately on Panamanian consent. That
                        consent has diminished over time. But our presence and <pb n="23"
                            facs="0048" xml:id="pg_23"/>style here have remained almost unchanged
                        while the world’s views on the practice of extraterritoriality have changed
                        radically and our policy elsewhere has been adjusted accordingly. Despite
                        this erosion, a minimum of Panamanian consent has endured because successive
                        Panamanian Governments have not pressed for fundamental changes; they have
                        judged the economic importance of the canal to Panama to be paramount and
                        they did not want to risk disturbing it. The fact is, however, that the
                        continuing growth of the Panamanian economy has meant that the importance of
                        our canal presence has steadily declined. The tremendous increase in public
                        sector spending in the last four years has meant that since 1970 the
                        Panamanian national budget has exceeded the budget of the Panama Canal
                        Company. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has completely
                        removed from power the Panamanian political leaders who had always run both
                        the private sector and the Government. This group not only had a variety of
                        economic and political ties to the U.S. but had also been the prime
                        beneficiaries of our canal presence. In addition to replacing them
                        politically, <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has silenced
                        them publicly by branding them as our instruments and allies in thwarting
                        Panamanian independence. There is then a Panamanian Government firmly in
                        power which, as part of its broad nationalistic course, is deliberately
                        undermining Panamanian consent to our presence on anything like existing
                        treaty terms.</p>
                    <p>Although there is this growing unity and purpose in Panama, the Panamanians
                        involved in the negotiation are emotional, cautious and indecisive in
                        dealing with us, and afraid to appear to make any concessions to us. Several
                        have political ambitions which they do not want to jeopardize by agreeing to
                        anything that could be criticized by their opponents. The position handed to
                        us on Dec. 4, 1972, was a “least common denominator.” It was something all
                        Panamanian negotiators and advisers could accept because it asked for almost
                        everything in the lifetime of those who wrote it. The Panamanians with whom
                        the negotiations were conducted in 1971 were patriotic, but realistic
                        Panamanians. Those who took over in early 1972 and shunted aside the
                        designated Panamanian negotiators are strongly nationalistic with little
                        disposition to work out what we would consider practical. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> draws a parallel with the
                        Vietnam negotiations and holds the view that if only he could sit down with
                        a Presidential envoy fully empowered to reach agreement one could be
                        achieved. Given the present negotiating positions and attitudes on both
                        sides, [illegible text—I agree?] with Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB_1">Anderson</persName> that it is not likely that an
                        overall mutually acceptable treaty can be negotiated. The possibility is
                        greater but not certain that a succession of agreements on specific points
                        could be reached which could over time result in a new relationship. The
                        prospects are much better for achieving a new relationship by phasing out
                            <pb n="24" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_24"/>many of our nonessential
                        functions and then signing a new treaty on what is essential to us than
                        through the procedure we are now following of obtaining a treaty and then
                        phasing out these nonessential functions.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Second, there is considerable disagreement on the U.S. side
                            as to what we acquired under the Convention of 1903, as amended.</hi> As
                        early as 1904, Secretary of War Taft said, “the very form in which these
                        attributes are conferred . . . seems to preserve the titular sovereignty . .
                        . in the Republic of Panama” and that Article III “is peculiar in not
                        conferring sovereignty directly upon the United States.” Nevertheless, it is
                        a commonly held view especially in Congress that we are sovereign. We
                        emphasize that view on the ground by flying the U.S. flag in the Canal Zone
                        in the position of the sovereign and not as administrator of the area. It is
                        similarly a widely held view in Congress, the Executive Branch and in the
                        Canal Zone that the Zone is territory of the United States. The view has
                        been carried to the extreme that when the U.S. Ambassador to Panama goes
                        into the Canal Zone he is held to have departed his post and to have entered
                        U.S. territory and therefore no longer entitled to be accorded the status of
                        personal representative of the President. On August 4, 1970 the Chief of
                        Protocol confirmed this interpretation to Assistant Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_MA_1">Meyer</persName> in stating that the “Canal Zone is
                        territory ceded to the United States by the Republic of Panama.”
                        Accordingly, it was concluded that “it would be highly improper . . . to
                        accord any American official precedence over the Governor.” The month before
                        the Acting Secretary had written the Foreign Minister of Panama “that the
                        Canal Zone is not a state, but rather . . . is a territory of the Republic
                        of Panama subject to the legal system established by the treaties and
                        agreements in force . . .”</p>
                    <p>On defense, as another example, we have a regional military headquarters in
                        Panama, and are negotiating to keep it. Panama seriously contests our right
                        under the existing Convention to have such a headquarters. Panama argues
                        that our right under the 1903 Convention to station land and naval forces in
                        Panama for canal protection is an exception in keeping with the exception to
                        the neutrality of the Isthmus provided for in the 1901 Treaty between the
                        U.S. and Great Britain. Thus, Panama regards the decision in 1963 to
                        establish a regional strategic headquarters as a violation of the neutrality
                        provisions of the 1903 Convention. Panama also holds that the 1903
                        Convention mentions only land and naval forces and the stationing of air
                        forces in the Zone is illegal. The Executive Branch has not addressed this
                        issue and only last week the Secretary of the Army told me that he had not
                        been aware there was a serious question about the legality of <gloss

                    <p>Whether we are sovereign and the Zone is U.S. territory or whether the 1903
                        Convention granted to the United States rights in Panamanian territory is
                        fundamental. If the 1903 Convention granted rights, and <pb n="25"
                            facs="0050" xml:id="pg_25"/>not territory, then it is in principle
                        simply an operational rights agreement. It is, of course, unusual in the
                        degree to which it grants rights and also in the way it permits us to
                        exercise those rights. The U.S. approach has been to negotiate about which
                        of our sovereign rights and what parts of our territory we would grant to
                        Panama in the Canal Zone. Panama considers that the Zone is its territory to
                        which it retained sovereignty and it is negotiating about the rights and
                        privileges which the U.S. would continue to have in Panama. Until we resolve
                        this fundamental conceptual problem we are not likely to make much progress
                        in resolving subsidiary issues.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Third, there is no firm understanding within the U.S.
                            Government of the importance of the canal either to our economy or for
                            strategic/military purposes.</hi> It is taken for granted that the canal
                        is very important to the U.S. economy. One of the major reasons for building
                        the canal was to have a waterway for coastwise shipping and at the beginning
                        about 50% of the traffic was of this type. Today it is about 3%. Another
                        economic justification is that 70% of the ships going through the canal
                        originate in or are destined for a U.S. port. But that is a statement of how
                        important the U.S. is to the canal—not how important the canal is to the
                        U.S. In fact only 16% of U.S. exports and imports pass through the canal,
                        i.e. 16% of 200%. I recommended that a study be made to determine the
                        savings to the U.S. economy of the canal. I hold no brief for the Embassy’s
                        rough estimate that it is about $100 million a year. [illegible text] if so,
                        the cost to the taxpayers of our economic assistance to Panama in all forms
                        and of the military protection of the canal is over twice this economic
                        benefit. The figures available to me suggest that the canal is of only
                        marginal value to our economy. I know of no study giving a solid
                        strategic/military justification. Our carriers and their accompanying task
                        forces cannot use the canal. I understand that naval planning is based on
                        the assumption of non-availability in wartime. There is, of course, much
                        more to our military/strategic interest than this but I am not aware that it
                        has been clearly defined in any study.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Finally, we have a serious problem of attitude and
                            confidence.</hi> Despite the President’s policy that we should seek a
                        new partnership based on respect for national identity and national dignity
                        in which rights and responsibilities are shared, <hi rend="italic">Panama
                            does not believe that we are prepared to treat her as an equal.</hi>
                        Part of the problem is, as President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> said, that “our power overshadows the formal
                        relationship of equality.” But it goes beyond that. In 1960 when President
                        Eisenhower decided to fly the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone in
                        recognition of Panama’s titular sovereignty, it was decided that the
                        Panamanian flag should always fly in an inferior position. In the
                        negotiations and consistent with our traditional policy, we have told the
                        Panamanians we could <pb n="26" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_26"/>not agree to
                        consult them on defense matters. Nor do we consult on the administration of
                        the canal itself even though we recognize that it profoundly affects Panama.
                        Panama’s response has been to refuse to recognize officially that the Panama
                        Canal Company even exists.</p>
                    <p>It is a fact that there is a wide gap between the respective positions of
                        Panama and the U.S. in the canal treaty negotiations. It is also
                        unfortunately true that there is a very wide gap between our stated policy
                        and our practice in Panama. These two facts are intimately related and until
                        we deal with the latter we will not be able to do much about the former.</p>

                        sessions between personal representatives at the <pb n="27" facs="0052"
                            xml:id="pg_27"/>highest level of the Governments of the U.S. and Panama.
                        He is seeking a vote of confidence from the District Representatives during
                        his tour of all provinces in Panama, reportedly to give him a mandate for
                        determining Panamanian policy vis-à-vis the Canal Treaty. Some top
                        government officials appear to be undecided as to the success of the UNSC
                        meeting. Others, particularly those with leftist leanings, are pleased with
                        the results. All are now waiting for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >TORRIJOS</persName> to announce the policy he believes Panama should
                        adopt with respect to Canal Treaty negotiations.</p>
                    <p>3. Businessmen appear to be uncertain as to what the future holds. Some are
                        of the opinion that the UNSC meeting might result in a hardening of
                        relations between the U.S. and Panama and that this will affect business.
                        Reportedly, some foreign businessmen in Panama have been advised to adopt a
                        wait-and-see attitude regarding further investments in Panama. The lower
                        classes in Panama were reported to be apathetic towards the UNSC meeting and
                        it is unlikely that any feeling of accomplishment has registered on them
                        although there has been some poisoning of attitudes towards the U.S.</p>
                    <p>4. The UNSC meeting apparently did not significantly affect Panamanian
                        attitudes towards the U.S. on the Canal Zone issue. The Panamanians still
                        want drastic changes made in the 1903 Treaty.</p>
                    <p>5. It is likely that U.S.-Panamanian ties/relations will become increasingly
                        strained during the coming months unless some kind of concession is made by
                        the U.S. to indicate a flexibility on the part of the U.S. which would be
                        interpreted by <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">TORRIJOS</persName> as a sign
                        the U.S. is showing “good faith.”</p>
                    <p>6. During the period of the UNSC meeting, Panama established diplomatic
                        relations with Algeria, Libya, Bulgaria, and Guinea. It also discussed the
                        establishment of diplomatic relations with East Germany, Cuba, the Soviet
                        Union and China. It is likely that Panama will continue to seek diplomatic
                        relations with socialist and non-aligned nations. The purpose of the policy
                        is threefold: to demonstrate that Panama is independent of the U.S., to
                        pressure the U.S. to grant a favorable new Canal Treaty, and to seek new
                        sources of foreign loans. It is likely Panama will side increasingly with
                        these countries in the UN and on issues which are not favored by the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>7. Internally it is unlikely Panama will make a dramatic shift towards a
                        socialist or communist orientation. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >TORRIJOS</persName> believes he is guiding Panama towards some sort of
                        socialist state, but to date he has not clearly defined by word or action
                        what he means by socialism. Nevertheless, the UNSC meeting has given
                        encouragement to the already worrisome communist penetration of certain key
                        domestic areas.</p>
                    <p>8. There is no evidence to suggest <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >TORRIJOS</persName> plans harassment of U.S. citizens and businessmen
                        in Panama. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">TORRIJOS</persName> has told U.S.
                            <pb n="28" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_28"/>officials there will be no
                        incident directed against the Canal Zone. There have been and there probably
                        will continue to be reports that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >TORRIJOS</persName> is actually planning or considering an incursion
                        into the Canal Zone. These reports may reflect psychological warfare
                        tactics, or actions contemplated by certain segments within the National
                        Guard.</p>
                    <p>9. It is likely that the government’s propaganda effort through its
                        controlled media and educational system is having and will continue to have
                        an impact on Panamanian attitudes towards the U.S. and the Canal Zone. This
                        propaganda effort undermines the past tacit acceptance by Panamanians of the
                        U.S. position in the Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>10. There is no reporting that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >TORRIJOS</persName> will compromise his publicly-stated objectives
                        regarding the Canal Zone. It is possible that after receiving his vote of
                        confidence from District Representatives, he might feel he has more room for
                        maneuver through secret negotiations. A factor which may influence <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">TORRIJOS</persName>’ decision on the extent he feels
                        he can compromise is his conception of what will be acceptable to the people
                        and what will tarnish his image. Such considerations become more important
                        at such times as the 11 October anniversary of the 1968 coup d’état which
                        brought the present government to power<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">For

                            >TORRIJOS</persName> feels that he must face the people and explain to
                        them what he has done towards fulfilling his promises. For example, he has
                        recently mentioned that 9 January 1974 will be an important anniversary in
                        terms of showing the people accomplishments in furthering Panamanian
                        aspirations regarding the Canal Zone. It is on these anniversaries that
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">TORRIJOS</persName> is frustrated at not
                        being able to demonstrate any accomplishments and is most susceptible to
                        urgings by his more radical and nationalistic advisors that he must show the
                        people something, that he must fulfill his promise to regain effective
                        sovereignty over the Canal Zone. The Government for now has tacit support of
                        the students and exercises effective control over them. It is expected this
                        will continue so long as the Government continues its position on the Canal
                        issue and its posture as a revolutionary government.</p>

                        Bilateral Meeting With Panamanian Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>.</p>
                    <p>1. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>, accompanied
                        by Panamanian Ambassador to Argentina Acheen, called on the Secretary
                        afternoon of May 24. <persName corresp="#p_KJB_1">Kubisch</persName> and
                        Little were also present.</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> opened the meeting by saying
                        that General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> had asked him
                        to speak to the Secretary about the negotiations respecting the Canal
                        treaty. He said that recently in Panama there had been a climate of
                        tranquility which the GOP expects to have a positive effect on the future of
                        the negotiations. This tranquility was particularly notable in the past week
                        and was reflected in the media in Panama. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> referred to the letter of February 23 from Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1">Anderson</persName><note n="2"

                            Bills and Resolutions 1973.</note> which he said he had answered on May
                            7.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">See <ref target="#d13fn3">footnote 3,
                                Document 13</ref>.</note> Coming out of that exchange was agreement
                        that there should be a vigorous effort to make progress in the treaty
                        negotiations. For this reason, he said, GOP has taken decision that a
                        supplementary letter should be addressed to the Secretary of State which
                        FonMin wished to deliver personally to the Secretary inasmuch as the two of
                        them were the “negotiators” on this question.<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">See
                            Tab A, <ref target="#d13">Document 13</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>3. Referring to his letter to the Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> said that one of the main problems in the negotiations
                        has been to reach agreement on a set of fundamental principles. He said that
                        in the many discussions there seemed to be agreement on those principles but
                        that subsequently different interpretations were given to them. As an
                        example, he cited the general agreement of the two parties that the primary
                        Panamanian interest was recuperation of its jurisdiction over the Canal Zone
                        and, on the other hand, that the principal interests of the U.S. are in
                        assuring the flow of traffic through the Canal and in certain defense and
                        security aspects. He said that there seemed to have been agreement on these
                        basic principles but that differences arose with respect to details. The
                        task now, as expressed in the latest letter, is to try to get agreement on
                        fundamental principles so that negotiations can progress more quickly. <pb
                            n="30" facs="0055" xml:id="pg_30"/>This, he said, was the purpose of the
                        note he was presenting to the Secretary. (Letter transmitted by septel.) If
                        we make a joint effort, he concluded, we can achieve something to spur on
                        the negotiating process.</p>
                    <p>4. In response to the Secretary’s query as to whether the Panamanians were
                        suggesting a “new team,” <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>
                        responded in the negative. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>
                        restated what he called their basic objective—to try to move things along as
                        quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>5. In his opening courtesy comments, <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> had referred to the Secretary’s preoccupation with
                        problems in many other areas of the world. At this point in the
                        conversation, the Secretary referred to that comment, stating that our
                        relations with Panama are very important to us and that we will do whatever
                        we can to reach a conclusion respecting the Canal question. He explained
                        that any agreement that might be reached must have the concurrence of our
                        Congress which must ratify a new agreement. The security considerations, we
                        think, are important. With respect to the feeling in the US regarding the
                        Canal question, the Secretary said that the sentiment is now different
                        because of the Security Council meeting which appeared to be an attempt to
                        force us into agreement. He continued that this makes the ratification
                        process that much more difficult.</p>
                    <p>6. The Secretary continued that the US had gotten the impression that the
                        Panamanian Government has decided to negotiate the Canal issue publicly. He
                        said that the issue is complex and that we want to deal with it privately.
                        He said that we, of course, will want to study the Foreign Minister’s note
                        carefully but we have this concern as to whether we can negotiate privately.
                        The Secretary said that we recognize that we must take into account Panama’s
                        concerns but that we must also keep our own interests in mind. The problem
                        is not an easy one but it should be dealt with in a friendly manner. The
                        Secretary then asked <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> if we
                        could negotiate in private.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> responded that following the
                        Security Council meeting, General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> had held a number of meetings with various sectors
                        of the public in Panama. The result was a vote of confidence for the GOP in
                        its policies respecting the Canal negotiations. The GOP, therefore, believed
                        there was now a good climate to move forward on the negotiations in the
                        coming months with discretion and privacy. He said that he was a man of his
                        word.</p>
                    <p>8. The Secretary acknowledged <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>’s
                        statements and emphasized that the Canal problem is a bilateral one between
                        our two countries. While there seemed to be sentiment in connection with the
                        Security Council meeting supporting Panama, he did not believe that other
                        countries care that much. The Secretary urged that there not be a situation
                        of confrontation but that we talk the matter over among <pb n="31"
                            facs="0056" xml:id="pg_31"/>ourselves. Stressing again the necessity for
                        having negotiations in private, the Secretary said that while we are
                        negotiating, there are some little things the US can do to ease the
                        situation. He said that we can talk about these matters while we are
                        negotiating.</p>
                    <p>9. The Secretary raised again the question of a “new team.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> responded that each government can,
                        of course, designate whom it wants for these negotiations but that if the
                        Secretary thought it would be helpful the Panamanians would give favorable
                        consideration to this possibility. The Secretary said that he certainly was
                        not criticizing the current teams, commenting that they had been working on
                        the matter for a long time.</p>
                    <p>10. The Secretary closed the meeting by saying again that we would study
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>’s note carefully, stating
                        that we did not want to set a precedent whereby a country takes a bilateral
                        matter to the Security Council and then gets action. While each country has
                        its own interests, he said, he does not believe there are fundamental
                        differences between us, reiterating the need for quiet talks. He expressed
                        the hope that our future negotiations would be active and not simply an
                        exchange of diplomatic notes. End.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I called separately on Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1"
                            >Fascell</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName>
                        and SFRC Staffman Pat Holt on June 5 to talk about U.S.-Panamanian
                        relations. So far as they are concerned the only important issue with
                        respect to Panama is the Canal treaty and that is all they wanted to talk
                        about.</p>
                    <p>All are sympathetic to the view that there has to be a change in the treaty
                        relationship. <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName> and Holt are
                        favorable to substantial <pb n="32" facs="0057" xml:id="pg_32"/>changes;
                            <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> is more cautious. None
                        of them see much possibility for a treaty, especially <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName>. Holt thought the 1967 drafts
                        would have been approved at the time—now he doubts that the two sides can
                        reconcile major differences and if a new treaty comes close to giving Panama
                        what it is asking it probably would not obtain approval in the Senate.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName> said the recent hearings
                        indicated to him that the Administration is not sure what it wants to do on
                        the treaty or whether it wants a treaty at all. He as well as the others
                        believe that the President will have to invest significant political capital
                        to get anything—a treaty or significant legislation to make adjustments.</p>
                    <p>Holt considers the interim action approach is probably the only viable
                        alternative at this time because of the lack of confidence between the U.S.
                        and Panama—Panama wants wide-sweeping changes now and does not trust the
                        U.S. unless it is all put down in writing and in detail and on the other
                        hand the U.S. does not trust Panama to exercise fairly and responsibly
                        jurisdictional rights it is demanding be returned. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> is an interim action proponent. (I
                        assume from all he said that he believes the canal lobby can successfully
                        play on the “lack of confidence in Panama” theme and defeat any significant
                        changes.) He doubts that it will be possible to obtain approval of any
                        significant interim action without a vigorous fight.</p>
                    <p>All agree that it is poor policy to exercise jurisdiction over Panamanians,
                        the Panamanian Government and private business in the Canal Zone. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> refers to the U.S. operation of a
                        “black” penitentiary in the Canal Zone as something that troubles him very
                        much. But Holt and more so <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName>
                        consider that any proposal on this will be fought as a “break in the dike.”
                        In fact <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> feels any change at
                        all that disturbs the privileged position of <gloss target="#t_PCC_1"
                            >PCC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CZG_1">CZG</gloss> employees (15%
                        hardship differential, U.S. Federal Income tax rebates, etc.) will be
                        opposed on the same ground, although he is disturbed by the discrimination
                        that these privileges represent against employees of other Federal agencies
                        in Panama and Panamanian employees. Holt believes that the procedural
                        problems in getting any action on interim measures is more important than
                        the substance, i.e., the Congress would be generally favorable but if it
                        starts in the Commerce committee it would be an unfavorable atmosphere.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> is still considering
                        hearings. He plans to press on the toll issue. He also intends to focus
                        attention on budget cuts as opposed to toll increases. The question about
                        whose territory the Canal Zone [is] arose, and it was left that <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> should ask the State Department
                        Legal Office. The 1903 Convention as amended states the zone is Panamanian
                        territory but <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName>’s staff did
                        not accept that. <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName>’s formula
                        is to give Panama more money (I do not have the impression that <persName
                            corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName>
                        <pb n="33" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_33"/>believe this will solve the problem
                        but he proposes it because that is all he feels he can do without too much
                        of a fight). When I responded that Panama had specifically rejected any such
                        approach as an insult his response was to say that we would have to persuade
                        Panama that a confrontation would not be helpful.</p>
                    <p>In summary, Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_LRL_1">Leggett</persName> and Mr. Holt are
                        sympathetic, believe some action is desirable, but if it requires
                        legislative action the Administration will have to be ready to make a
                        concerted effort to get it.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>It has been approximately nine years since I undertook to try to renegotiate
                        our treaty relationships with the Republic of Panama. These responsibilities
                        have included the Treaty of 1903, our rights to build a sea level canal at
                        an appropriate time, and our military base rights and military operational
                        rights within the Republic of Panama.</p>
                    <p>As you know, in 1967 the negotiators were able to draft agreements which the
                        respective negotiating teams were prepared to present to their governments.
                        For reasons well known to you, these draft agreements as approved by the
                        negotiators on both sides were never submitted to the legislative bodies of
                        either country.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">In 1967, the United States and
                            Panama were able to reach agreement on three treaties regarding the
                            existing canal, the defense and neutrality of the existing canal, and a
                            possible sea level canal. Before the treaties could be ratified,
                            however, Panamanian President <persName corresp="#p_RMMA_1">Marco
                                Robles</persName> was defeated by <persName corresp="#p_AMA_1"
                                >Arnulfo Arias Madrid</persName> in the 1968 elections. Eleven days
                            into Arias’ term, a coup led by General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                                >Omar Torrijos</persName> established a new government. For more

                    <p>During this period of negotiating effort, as you know, I have served without
                        monetary compensation but have contributed my efforts as a public
                        service.</p>



                    <p>I do not know what the future holds for the relations between our country and
                        Panama, but I do believe that it is highly desirable to <pb n="34"
                            facs="0059" xml:id="pg_34"/>arrive at new treaty relationships on all of
                        the topics which we have under negotiation as early as possible.</p>
                    <p>After so many years, it might now be best if new points of view were brought
                        to bear on the subjects. All of our efforts, as you well know, have been
                        under the guidelines of the Presidents under whom I have served.</p>
                    <p>Believing, as I do, that these efforts should be pursued with diligence, and
                        that perhaps new efforts by new people should be undertaken, I respectfully
                        submit my resignation as Special Representative of the United States for
                        Interoceanic Canal Negotiations, effective immediately.<note n="3"

                        high-level agreement in principle should be reached between the two

                    <p>Although the level of generalization probably required to reach agreement in
                        principle with the Panamanians will obscure many important and
                        difficult-to-resolve issues, we believe we should, nevertheless, seek to
                        accommodate Panama as a means of advancing the negotiations, in light of the
                        considerable importance Panama apparently attaches to proceeding in this
                        manner. Accordingly, I have attached for your approval a modified version of

                        State and Defense, as well as the U.S. negotiators would accept (Tab C). We
                        would expect the U.S. negotiators to seek Panamanian acquiescence in the
                        changes we have proposed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to address Your Excellency in relation to the process of
                            negotiations between our two countries on the conclusion of a new treaty
                            on the interoceanic canal that operates in Panamanian territory. Your
                            Excellency will recall that those negotiations were renewed some time
                            after the talk we had on July 26, 1970, during the Special Meeting of
                            the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in
                            Washington, D.C.</p>
                        <p>As you know, after some months of discussions by the negotiating
                            missions, your Government’s mission prepared a series of drafts in which
                            it sought to reduce to treaty terms the subjects that had been
                            discussed. On December 13, 1971, the United States representatives <pb
                                n="37" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_37"/>also submitted a memorandum that
                            classified those subjects under various headings and, according to their
                            judgment of the matter, set forth the positions of each country.</p>
                        <p>Later my Government stated that the positions of the United States of
                            America as set forth in both the drafts and the memorandum were
                            unacceptable to my country and it gave the pertinent reasons, in writing
                            and during the visit to Panama of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WD_1"
                                >David A. Ward</persName> and other United States Government
                            officials in the months of February and June 1972.</p>

                            the state of the negotiations and expressed certain concepts concerning
                            the matters under discussion.<note n="7" xml:id="d13fn7">In the October

                            to hold meetings in this city with the Panamanian representatives, and
                            announced that the latter had precise instructions on the questions they
                            were to set forth.</p>
                        <p>Early in December 1972 Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1">Robert B.

                            Affairs, I handed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1"
                                >Anderson</persName> the document entitled “Panama’s Basic Positions

                            note dated May 7, 1973, a copy of which I attach for Your

                                >Anderson</persName>’s note had led me to decide to address Your

                            desirable to do so in order to accelerate the later course of the
                            present negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_38"/>
                        <p>To that end I want on this occasion, Mr. Secretary, to reiterate my
                            country’s fundamental criterion in this very vital matter. The
                            negotiations cannot reach their conclusion and fulfill their purpose if
                            they do not truly result in the elimination of the causes of conflict
                            that have so seriously affected relations between our two countries
                            through more than seven decades. Those causes of conflict can be
                            eliminated only by making radical changes in the system that today
                            governs the administration, maintenance, and operation of the Canal, a
                            system that constitutes, as has been said so many times, a colonial
                            enclave in the midst of the territory of the Republic of Panama, thereby
                            imposing untenable jurisdictional limitations on my country’s
                            independence and on the full exercise of its sovereignty over all of the
                            territory that belongs to it.</p>
                        <p>The elimination of those causes of conflict requires, first [of] all, an
                            express declaration of abrogation of the Treaty of 1903 and of all the
                            other treaties and instruments of any kind whatever related thereto. It
                            is true that the United States has stated in official documents its
                            agreement concerning that abrogation, but it is also true that the
                            abrogation would not have full effect if a new treaty were to contain
                            provisions that in any form or degree limited, confused, or obstructed
                            the return of the portion of Panamanian territory known as the Canal
                            Zone to the full jurisdiction of the Republic of Panama. Furthermore, we
                            consider it just and equitable that in the new treaty, as expressed by
                            your Government in the note signed by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_ARB_1">Anderson</persName> on October 5, 1972, the bases
                            should be laid for the Republic of Panama to assume in due course full
                            responsibility for the operation of the interoceanic waterway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Secretary, the Panamanian Government considers that the root of the
                            problem in advancing the negotiations lies in the need to clarify in
                            advance a point that is fundamental and decisive: Is the interoceanic
                            canal, which is operated, maintained, and protected by the Government of
                            the United States, functioning in territory that is an integral part of
                            the Republic of Panama, or does the United States consider that the
                            territory where the canal is located should be severed from the
                            effective sovereignty and full jurisdiction of the Republic of
                            Panama?</p>
                        <p>Unquestionably, unless there is a prior clear and precise agreement on
                            this point, it will be very difficult for negotiations to advance. To
                            Panama it is very clear that the canal is operating in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Panamanian territory</hi>, and my country cannot permit the
                            limitations that the United States has imposed on the exercise of its
                            effective sovereignty in and full jurisdiction over the Canal Zone to
                            continue much longer. For the sake of reaching a negotiated settlement,
                            my Government has agreed to a transition period so that the Canal Zone
                            may be returned completely to the effective sovereignty of the
                            Panamanian State.</p>
                        <p>The United States negotiators appeared to accept this Panamanian position
                            when, for example, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1"
                                >Anderson</persName> affirmed in his <pb n="39" facs="0064"

                                23.</note> that the United States has already proposed wide-sweeping
                            changes, among which he mentions “the adoption of measures which would
                            permit the cultural, social, and economic integration of the Canal Zone
                            with Panama <hi rend="italic">and the end of the Zone as a separate area
                                under United States jurisdiction.</hi>” However, that language
                            proves ambiguous [words missing] <hi rend="italic">political</hi>
                            integration of the Zone to Panama. And further on in the same note, he
                            says: “The United States is prepared to relinquish all <hi rend="italic"
                                >significant</hi> governmental functions within a number of years
                            which we can no doubt agree upon. Some would be relinquished
                            immediately, others at various times that we can discuss. <hi

                                responsibilities should be retained.</hi>” (Underlining is
                                mine).<note n="11" xml:id="d13fn11">The underlined text is in

                        <p>It is here, Mr. Secretary, in this ambiguity, that the root of the
                            problem lies, and therefore, my country cannot agree to the proposals
                            formulated by the United States, much less in the form in which they
                            were stated by the United States delegation in the 1971 drafts.</p>
                        <p>I wish to point out that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1"
                                >Anderson</persName> states in the above-mentioned communications
                            certain concepts that appear to be close to the Panamanian positions.
                            However, his statements are nearly always general, and part of the
                            difficulty lies in the fact that in the course of the negotiations, when
                            an effort is made to develop those general statements into contractual
                            stipulations, the proposals made by the United States Ambassadors
                            distort the principles that they themselves have stated, so that,
                            instead of settling the situation that both countries are committed to
                            eliminate, conditions for subsequent differences and conflicts are
                            established.</p>
                        <p>I also wish to tell you once more, Mr. Secretary, that my Government
                            reiterates its desire to reach agreement with the Government of the
                            United States on the adoption of a just and equitable treaty that will
                            put an end to the causes of conflict between our two countries. The
                            problem of the Panama Canal is a matter of special concern to the
                            nations of this Hemisphere, which, as the Secretary General of the
                            United Nations has said, “awaits a solution that can only be based on
                            respect for law and a search for justice.” “Any solution,” in the
                            opinion of that distinguished official of the world organization, “will
                            have to take into account the basic principles set forth in the Charter,
                            such as territorial integrity, sovereign equality, and the obligation to
                            settle all international disputes by pacific means, as well as the
                            principle that has now become a generally accepted one, that is to say,
                            that every <pb n="40" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_40"/>State has the right to
                            exploit fully and on its own account all its natural possibilities.”</p>
                        <p>Like the other States of Latin America and the rest of the world, Panama
                            wishes to have the unequivocal right to assume its responsibilities for
                            its own ideas, initiatives, and actions. My small country also has a
                            very clear idea of its own national identity. But those responsibilities
                            and that national identity cannot be fully realized as long as an
                            important part of our territory continues to be subject to
                            jurisdictional limitations.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> set forth the
                            five basic principles of United States policy toward Latin America in
                            October 1969 and reaffirmed them in his foreign policy report to the
                            United States Congress on May 3, 1973.<note n="12" xml:id="d13fn12">See
                                    <hi rend="italic">Public Papers, Nixon, 1970,</hi> pp. 135–136,
                                and ibid., <hi rend="italic">1973</hi> pp. 440–441.</note> The
                            second of those five principles establishes the following: respect for
                            national identity and national dignity.</p>
                        <p>Also, in that same report, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> expressed the following concepts with respect to
                            the question of the Panama Canal:</p>
                        <p>“Another important unresolved problem concerns the Panama Canal and the
                            surrounding Zone. U.S. operation of the Canal and our presence in Panama
                            are governed by the terms of a treaty drafted in 1903. The world has
                            changed radically during the 70 years this treaty has been in effect.
                            Latin America has changed. Panama has changed. And the terms of our
                            relationship should reflect those changes in a reasonable way.</p>
                        <p>“For the past nine years, efforts to work out a new treaty acceptable to
                            both parties have failed. That failure has put considerable strain on
                            our relations with Panama. It is time for both parties to take a fresh
                            look at this problem and to develop a new relationship between us—one
                            that will guarantee continued effective operation of the Canal while
                            meeting Panama’s legitimate aspirations.”<note n="13" xml:id="d13fn13"
                                >See ibid., p. 443</note></p>
                        <p>The concepts of the President of the United States certainly reflect a
                            very clear historical awareness of the significance of the profound
                            political, economic, and social changes which characterize the present
                            era.</p>
                        <p>Within the framework of that philosophy we could make a vigorous effort
                            to establish, in advance, the basic principles which should serve as the
                            foundation for that new just and fair Canal treaty that our two
                            countries agreed to conclude in the Joint Declaration of April 3, 1964,
                            signed under the auspices of the Council of the Organization of Ameri<pb

                                655–656.</note> The Republic of Panama deems those basic principles
                            to be:</p>
                        <p>1. The 1903 treaty must be abrogated. The two countries are willing to
                            conclude an entirely new interoceanic canal treaty.</p>
                        <p>2. The concept of perpetuity is rejected. The new treaty concerning the
                            lock canal shall have a fixed termination date.</p>
                        <p>3. The exercise of any type of jurisdiction by the United States in
                            Panamanian territory shall quickly cease, at the end of the transition
                            period agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>4. The so-called Canal Zone shall be returned to full Panamanian
                            jurisdiction. The Republic of Panama, as territorial sovereign, is
                            willing to grant the Government of the United States, for the duration
                            of the new treaty on the interoceanic canal, the right to use the lands
                            and waters proved to be essential for the operation and maintenance of
                            the canal, the transit of ships, and the protection of vital
                            installations.</p>
                        <p>5. The Republic of Panama shall have a just and equitable share in the
                            benefits, in proportion to the total benefits that the United States and
                            world trade derive from Panama’s geographic location.</p>
                        <p>6. The activity of the United States Government shall be limited to the
                            administration of transit through the interoceanic waterway. The
                            activities of the United States Government shall be those which have a
                            direct relation to the operation, maintenance, and protection of the
                            Canal, as shall be specified in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>7. The United States of America shall exercise, in the facilities for
                            protection, such activities as may be expressly stipulated in the
                            treaty, for the duration of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>8. The Republic of Panama is willing to include in that same treaty
                            provisions authorizing the Government of the United States to construct
                            a sea-level canal along what has been designated Route 14, on the
                            following conditions: (a) The United States will notify Panama of its
                            decision to construct the sea-level canal along Route 14 within a
                            reasonable period to be negotiated, following the entry into force of
                            the new treaty, and if it should fail to do so its right in that respect
                            would lapse; (b) Panama would retain full jurisdiction in the area that
                            would be occupied by the sea-level canal; and (c) with respect to the
                            sea-level canal, the life of the treaty shall have a limited duration,
                            with a specified termination date.</p>

                        <p>I would hope, Mr. Secretary, that the United States negotiators might
                            come to Panama as soon as possible, with specific instructions that

                    <p>The Security Council meeting which Panama hosted in mid-March, condemning the
                        US on the canal issue, was originally regarded as an enormous success by
                        Panama. However, the meeting did not bring tangible benefits to Panama, and,
                        ironically, it has been followed by increasing criticism of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> government. The hollow victory
                        might lead to a more productive atmosphere for canal treaty discus<pb n="46"
                            facs="0071" xml:id="pg_46"/>sions, particularly if the US were able to
                        provide interim concessions which <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> could use to counter the criticism.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Beating the odds.</hi> Perhaps the most significant point
                        about the Security Council meeting is that Panama was able to pull it off at
                        all, despite (1) Panama’s admitted intention to air its views on the canal
                        treaty issue, (2) the absence of any Latin issues before the Council which
                        warranted a meeting away from UN headquarters, (3) open US opposition, and
                        (4) lack of enthusiasm among other potential participants. Panamanian
                        lobbying succeeded because other Latin countries were reluctant to oppose a
                        meeting in the hemisphere. Non-Latin countries went along because the Latins

                    <p>While Latin participants were dissatisfied by Panama’s continual focus of
                        attention on the canal issue, their public reactions were almost entirely in
                        accord with Panama’s wishes. Seventeen delegates from Latin American
                        countries spoke at the meeting, and almost all made at least a passing
                        reference to the canal issue in terms favorable to Panama. Some foreign
                        ministers sent messages of congratulations; congressional support was voiced
                        in Uruguay and Venezuela; and the meeting received generally favorable press
                        coverage in the hemisphere. Most important for Panama were the affirmative
                        votes on the canal resolution from all members of the Council except Britain
                        (abstention) and the US (veto).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Reaction within Panama.</hi> Immediately after the Security
                        Council meeting, top members of the Panamanian Government were euphoric
                        because the meeting seemed to have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.
                        Leftist students and the Communist Party were pleased. Organizations
                        normally opposed to the government felt compelled to express support for the
                        meeting. Yet, when <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> went
                        out on the road to deliver speeches on Panama’s great diplomatic victory and
                        to seek votes of confidence to continue his policies, he discovered that the
                        general public was apathetic to the “historic” event. Moreover, middle-level
                        bureaucrats reportedly were not pleased because the cost of the
                        meeting—estimated at between $500,000 and $1.5 million—had forced a crimp in
                        government spending. Members of the business community were unenthusiastic
                        and felt that the meeting was a failure for Panama.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> hopes to be remembered as
                        the Panamanian leader who brought his country social justice and who
                        hammered out a new canal treaty with the United States. Both these goals
                        still appear to be unattainable. Until now it seemed that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> was under no serious internal
                        pressure to seek an agreement with the US; ironically, in the aftermath of
                        the Security Council meeting, such pressure may be beginning.</p>
                    <p>Criticism of the government has been increasing. Though some of the causes
                        predate the Council meeting, business community uneasi<pb n="47" facs="0072"
                            xml:id="pg_47"/>ness seems to have been sharply accentuated by the
                        meeting. The result has been fresh signs of student unrest, the appearance
                        of defamatory underground newspapers, and more open opposition on the part
                        of the business community. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                        >Torrijos</persName>’ concern over mounting criticism and economic
                        difficulties, particularly the loss of confidence by the private sector
                        (which is partly attributable to anxieties over the treaty impasse), could
                        lead him to take a more forthcoming position on the canal treaty. Indeed, he
                        may now fear that lack of progress in obtaining a new treaty will be seen by
                        the Panamanian people as evidence that his government is a failure.</p>
                    <p>Past experience has shown that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> has always placed great store in the value of
                        pressure tactics—that if you kick the US hard enough it will respond. He may
                        now have to reexamine this assumption since the Security Council meeting—his
                        supreme effort at international pressure—brought him little or nothing in
                        the way of concessions from the US. It will be difficult indeed to think up
                        an encore to follow that act.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Implications for the US.</hi> To achieve progress on the
                        treaty, <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> may have to change
                        his tactics. He could, of course, move in the direction of violence against
                        the US presence in the Zone. This, however, would endanger his position
                        under the best of circumstances, as the Guard would eventually have to
                        reestablish order. It would be particularly perilous in times of growing
                        disorder in that dissident elements in the society could coalesce to
                        overthrow him. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ best hope
                        of success appears to lie in the direction of a more conciliatory stance
                        vis-à-vis the US. The most recent communication from Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> to Secretary Rogers may
                        reflect some change in policy.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">See Tab A, <ref

                    <p>These indications of some give on Panama’s side may be a sign that canal
                        treaty discussions can proceed in a more productive atmosphere, particularly
                        if the US position were to provide some immediate interim concessions which
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> could present as a
                        counter to the rising chorus of complaints. Such a move would also benefit
                        the US by relieving the pressure of international criticism. The goal of a
                        new treaty will probably still be elusive for the immediate future, but the
                        present situation at least holds out hope for a less stormy period in
                        US-Panamanian relations.</p>

                        resist. Panama would be attending forthcoming Algiers meeting of nonaligned

                    </opener>
                    <p>In replying to your thoughtful letter of May 21, I have wanted to wait until
                        I could advise you of the arrangements I have made with a view to
                        implementing, on the United States’ side, the results of our constructive
                        discussions in Buenos Aires.<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>I welcome the renewed commitment of your government to reach agreement on a
                        new treaty that will be just and equitable for both our countries—a treaty
                        that will, in the words of my President, which you have quoted to me,
                        “guarantee the continued effective operation of the Canal while meeting
                        Panama’s legitimate aspirations”. My government is equally committed to the
                        successful conclusion of a negotiation process which is of great importance
                        not only to our two countries but also to the world.</p>
                    <p>In recognition of that importance, and in furtherance of our discussions in
                        Buenos Aires, I am pleased to inform you that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName> has been selected to head
                        the United States’ negotiating team. I am confident that the Ambassador, a
                        most distinguished American and a gentleman of vast experience, will exert
                        every effort to translate my government’s commitment—as you in your capacity
                        as head of Panama’s negotiating team will strive to translate your
                        government’s commitment—into the conclusion of a new treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador’s appointment as an Ambassador-at-Large of the United States
                        was announced in Washington August 2, and his nomination is being forwarded
                        to the Senate for its advice and consent. The Congress will, however, be in
                        adjournment until the first days of September. I would expect that shortly
                        thereafter the approval of the Senate would be completed, so that the
                        Ambassador might then be in a position to commence his discussions with
                            you.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3"><persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                        These discussions, as you and <pb n="50" facs="0075" xml:id="pg_50"/>I have
                        agreed, would initiate an examination of the basic principles upon which a
                        new treaty might be based.</p>
                    <p>I should like to take this opportunity to respond to several points of
                        particular interest that you have raised in your letter to me. First, I
                        think it is clear that, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention
                        of 1903, the territory within which the Canal now functions, while clearly
                        constituting part of the Republic of Panama, is also territory under the
                        jurisdiction of the United States. Second, I wish to assure you that the
                        United States remains prepared, as we have stated in the past, to agree to
                        the abrogation of that Convention and the amendments thereto, and to replace
                        those agreements with an entirely new, and mutually satisfactory, canal
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>Third, in your letter to me you suggest eight principles which you regard as
                        constituting a basis for further progress in negotiations toward a new
                        treaty relationship. I have read these principles with great interest and
                        find important elements in them that my government is prepared to accept. It
                        is my hope that your discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> on these principles will lead to progress toward
                        laying the foundations upon which a new treaty may be based.</p>
                    <p>With best regards,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>1) Summary: I delivered to Foreign Minister on Aug. 16 original of
                        Secretary’s letter of Aug. 6 on Canal negotiations. Foreign Minister handed
                        me his reply of Aug. 14.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">The full text of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>’s reply was transmitted

                            P840114–1808)</note> I conveyed Secretary’s best wishes <pb n="51"
                            facs="0076" xml:id="pg_51"/>as Secretary had requested me to do. Foreign
                        Minister was pleased with Secretary’s initiative on negotiations. Foreign
                        Minister said that Panama would not raise Canal issue in UNGA but speech
                        would have to mention it. He said Panama would participate in non-aligned
                        conference as observer only and had resisted pressure to become full
                        member.</p>
                    <p>2) I called on Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>
                        at 1645 on Aug. 16 to deliver original of Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>’ letter of Aug. 6 on Canal
                        negotiations. I told him that I had discussed US-Panamanian relations with
                        Secretary and Secretary had asked me to convey to him his best wishes.
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> was obviously pleased with
                        Secretary’s initiative and considered that it indicated significant effort
                        to reach agreement.</p>
                    <p>3) Foreign Minister handed me reply to Secretary’s letter. He said
                        Secretary’s letter was very positive but he had to comment specifically on
                        sentence which stated Canal Zone is Panamanian territory under U.S.
                        jurisdiction. He said that Panama’s position since 1904 has been that U.S.
                        jurisdiction is limited to certain functions and a Panamanian Foreign
                        Minister in 1973 would be subject to severe criticism if he did not
                        reiterate that position for the record. I said that there is considerable
                        misunderstanding in the U.S. about the status of the Canal Zone with the
                        popular view being that the zone is U.S. territory. I therefore regarded the
                        sentence in the Secretary’s letter as very helpful in preparing the ground
                        for a successful negotiation. The Foreign Minister agreed and wanted his
                        restatement of Panama’s traditional position to be understood as simply a
                        statement for the record. He said he understood the Secretary’s point to be
                        that the existing situation regardless of differing interpretations could
                        only be changed by a new treaty and he accepted that.</p>
                    <p>4) The Foreign Minister then said that Panama would be attending the
                        non-aligned conference as an observer only. He said that Panama had been
                        pressed to accept full membership but had not done so. He did not know who
                        would head the Panamanian delegation but implied by his emphasis on
                        “observer” that he would not be going.</p>
                    <p>5) He said that he also wanted to inform me that Panama would not ask that
                        the Canal issue be put on the agenda of the UNGA session. The speech by
                        Panama’s representative would refer to the Canal issue, however. It had not
                        been decided whether he would go to the UNGA and, if not, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName> would be speaking for
                        Panama.</p>
                    <p>6) Comment: The Foreign Minister was obviously pleased with the indications
                        of progress on the negotiations. He expressed satisfaction with the
                        selection of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and
                        indicated his awareness of the time it would take for Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> to study the issues, consult with
                        Congress, and obtain instructions from the Secretary and President. Although
                        the Panamanian decisions on the non-aligned conference and the UNGA are
                        helpful with respect to relations generally <pb n="52" facs="0077"
                            xml:id="pg_52"/>and the Canal issue specifically, and I told the Foreign
                        Minister so, the one on the non-aligned conference especially is probably
                        intended to avoid further disturbing the internal political situation. The
                        GOP now has an internal crisis over Communists and leftist elements in
                        government. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> is identified with
                        the group within the GOP that has favored bringing these elements into
                        government and also with establishing closer relations with Cuba, etc. He is
                        therefore being cautious and drawing back to protect his position.</p>

                    <p>The attached intelligence report is in tune with what we have been seeing in
                        Panama for 18 months.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">The CIA Intelligence
                            Report, dated August 17, is attached but not printed.</note> Paragraph 2
                        indicates that in the next round of negotiations Panama intends to reiterate
                        its basic position which is the same as, or harder than, the position which
                        was taken at the start. This reflects Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>’s views and a reluctance of officials
                        in Panama to take the responsibility for recommending any concessions on the
                        Panamanian side. Throughout the negotiations, in fact, despite several
                        changes of position by the US, Panama has never definitively changed its
                        position except in trivial respects.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">To cope with
                            this situation I have sought to give the Panamanian negotiators an idea
                            from hints and suggestions as to what over-all settlement might work
                            with us. This would permit them to go back to their own government and,
                            without recommending concessions, notify <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName> of what kind of a deal is possible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> could then himself take the
                            initiative and tell the negotiators to close. Obviously this has not
                            worked yet. [Footnote is in the original.]</note></p>
                    <p>After giving us a drubbing at the Security Council meeting the Panamanians
                        may have expected us to buckle under the pressure and offer them a number of
                        concessions which we had theretofore refused <pb n="53" facs="0078"
                            xml:id="pg_53"/>to give. Until Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                            >Roger</persName>’s letter of August 6, however, we did not even reply
                        to their suggestions about further negotiations and they have recently
                        become rather nervous about the situation. Nonetheless they will approach
                        the new round of the negotiations with the hope that we will have changed
                        our offer in their favor and they have made public statements that this may
                        occur. Some reports suggest that they believe the long delay in the
                        negotiations has resulted from deliberations concerning the alteration of
                        our offer and some may view your appointment as a signal of a new policy
                        more favorable to Panama.</p>
                    <p>Policy deliberations have indeed been underway but the result of them has not
                        been a recommendation that new concessions should forthwith be offered. The
                        Under Secretaries Committee paper which reviews our policy does not
                        recommend Option A—the option which would enlarge our negotiating latitude
                        and move us substantially toward Panama’s position.<note n="4"

                            Secretaries Study Memoranda U/SM 136 [2 of 2]. The paper presented four
                            options for negotiation: A) continue to negotiate seriously, with a view
                            to what changes in the U.S. position would result in a treaty; B)
                            continue to negotiate seriously without changing the existing
                            negotiating guidelines; C) continue to negotiate seriously, but make
                            unilateral changes that did not require Congressional approval in order
                            to improve relations with Panama, and present to Congress changes that
                            would not disturb the status quo in the Canal Zone; and D) negotiating
                            seriously without making changes to the existing offer, proceeding to
                            make the unilateral changes in the Canal Zone already offered to Panama
                            in the negotiations, and presenting to Congress unilateral changes that
                            would change the status quo in the Canal Zone. The Department of State
                            favored option B.</note> My own view is that if any changes are to be
                        made in the US position they should be made in response to concessions by
                        Panama that really advance the possibilities of a full settlement.</p>
                    <p>Although the Under Secretaries Committee memorandum does not recommend any
                        enlargement of the negotiating authority, there is some unused authority
                        remaining, as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Duration—essentially no additional authority.</p>
                    <p>2. Land—broad authority, but not much additional land has been cleared for
                        release with the Pentagon or Canal Company.</p>
                    <p>3. Jurisdiction—broad authority remaining, but this is a touchy one in
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>4. Payment to Panama—broad authority remaining, but significant increases
                        could raise problems in Congress.</p>
                    <p>5. Expansion—essentially no additional authority.</p>
                    <p>6. Defense—possibly some latitude—situation is vague.</p>

                        between the US and Panamanian positions would still be quite wide.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 2 states the source’s view that there will be no modification in
                        the Panamanian position until Panama has assessed our reaction to its
                        December statement of position. Paragraph 3 alludes to <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ chronic inability to make up
                        his mind on the treaty issue. In view of these suggestions, which are well
                        in accord with our past experience, and our general knowledge that Panama is
                        worried about the delay and its own conduct at the Security Council meeting,
                        I think the following thoughts should be conveyed:</p>
                    <p>1. We cannot accept Panama’s demands that the US give up the canal by the
                        year 2000.</p>
                    <p>2. We will have to retain certain limited jurisdictional and land use control
                        rights for the duration of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>3. We will need the unilateral right to defend the canal and US personnel and
                        facilities—without asking prior consent of Panama.</p>
                    <p>4. Negotiations are more likely to succeed if Panama does not simply repeat
                        its original position. We need compromise proposals and a willingness to
                        express definitive agreement on detailed treaty provisions.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps there will be some movement in the Panamanian position after it is
                        recognized that the Security Council events have not caused a change in our
                        perception of how this matter can best be settled.</p>

                    <p>—Of the three Defense Department components, the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1"
                            >JCS</gloss> and Army concurred. <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"

                            involved negotiating seriously with the Panamanians without making

                            in the Canal Zone already offered to Panama in the negotiations, and
                            presenting to Congress unilateral changes that would change the status
                            quo in the Canal Zone.</note> believing that to do so would be to offer
                        Panama a major bargaining chip in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Unexpectedly, Secretary of the Army <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1"
                            >Callaway</persName> requested a meeting of the Under Secretaries
                        Committee. Defense Department officials have given us—reluctantly—only the
                        sketchiest idea of the issues they will raise, partly because they are still
                        negotiating internally.</p>
                    <p>Apparently the original purpose for requesting a meeting was to emphasize the
                        importance the Army attaches to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> receiving the concurrence of the Washington agencies
                        concerned prior to implementing any of the unilateral actions which the
                            IG/<gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss> paper<note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3"
                            >Not found.</note> suggests that the President be asked to approve. (We
                        do not know the reason for this but surmise that the Army is concerned at
                        the possibility of an adverse psychological impact on Canal Zone residents
                        were the unilateral actions to be implemented in a piece-meal fashion.)</p>
                    <p>Once you had agreed to the USC meeting, <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                            >OSD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss> perceived an
                        opportunity to press its case against recommended Option D. We <pb n="56"
                            facs="0081" xml:id="pg_56"/>understand that the Office of the Secretary
                        of the Army has been persuaded by <gloss target="#t_OSD_1"
                            >OSD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss> to reverse its
                        concurrence for Option D, given at the Inter-Agency Group meeting on August
                        28. The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> is apparently also being
                        pressured to change its approval so that three Defense Department entities
                        can present a united front at the Under Secretaries meeting.</p>
                    <p>We understand indirectly that the opposition of Ambassador Hill and Army
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> (and perhaps
                        Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>) to Option
                        D is based on their concern at the erosion of U.S. power positions around
                        the world. Evidently they hold that the Canal Zone is one position which the
                        U.S. has the force, and the legality, to retain, and that the unilateral
                        actions proposed in Option D would diminish the U.S. capacity to exercise
                        sovereign rights in the Zone, with a consequent distinct erosion of our
                        position there.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is possible that the Defense representatives will try to persuade the
                        Committee to back away from Option D and instead recommend Option C to the
                        President, or to recommend a watered-down version of Option D.</p>
                    <p><gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss> believes we must firmly resist efforts
                        to move away from Option D. The treaty negotiation will be protracted and
                        difficult, and significant changes in the nature of our presence in Panama
                        as proposed in Option D are needed in the interim to (a) improve the
                        negotiating climate by encouraging Panama to be forthcoming and (b) lessen
                        our “colonialist” image and thereby reduce international criticism.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                    <p>1. If a Defense representative tries to use the meeting to obtain a more
                        explicit understanding that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> must obtain prior concurrence before offering to
                        Panama the unilateral actions contemplated in Option D, we recommend that
                        you</p>
                    <p>(a) Observe that the paper as written already calls for prior concurrence,
                        and also acknowledges the need for implementing the actions so as to
                        minimize their impact on Zone residents; and</p>
                    <p>(b) Suggest that the Committee agree to make “particular record” of this
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>2. If the Defense components urge the Committee to change the recommendation
                        for the President from Option D to Option C, or to a watered-down version of
                        Option D, we recommend that you</p>
                    <p>(a) Ask the State representative to restate briefly the case for Option
                        D;</p>
                    <p>(b) Invite Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> to
                        comment;</p>
                    <p>(c) Inquire whether any agency apart from Defense has changed its view with
                        respect to Option D and, if that is not the case,</p>
                    <pb n="57" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_57"/>
                    <p>(d) Note that the consensus remains in favor of Option D and that we are
                        encouraged to submit disagreements to the highest level of this government,
                        and invite Defense to submit a formal dissenting statement to accompany the
                        Memorandum to the President.</p>
                    <p>3. If Defense representatives, in support of their desire to back away from
                        Option D, speak of the need to prevent erosion of our few remaining power
                        positions abroad and cite the Canal Zone as a prime example, we recommend
                        that you comment as follows:</p>
                    <p>(a) The modern world does not accept that one nation should exercise
                        perpetual extraterritoriality—backed by military force—in another’s
                        territory. The President was surely recognizing that fact when he ordered
                        resumption of negotiations with Panama.</p>
                    <p>(b) The situation in Panama is such that we should give up some rights and
                        properties—that is, some attributes of sovereignty—for which we no longer
                        have any need, and which cost us something to preserve, in order to be able
                        to retain the sovereign rights we still need since they are critical to
                        operation and defense of the Canal for a further extended period.</p>

                    <p>State favored the selection of a civilian as the next Governor of the Canal
                        Zone, while Defense recommended that the President continue to look to the
                        Army Corps of Engineers as the primary source for qualified candidates for
                        Governor. State’s position was supported by CIA, Treasury, USIA, OMB,
                        Commerce, and the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. Accordingly, the
                        proposed Memorandum to the President from the Under Secretaries Committee
                        recommended that</p>
                    <quote>“ . . . when a successor to the present Governor is considered, attention
                        be given to the possibility of appointing a qualified civilian as his
                        successor.”</quote>
                    <p>When queried last week the Department of Commerce, while concurring with
                        State’s position, suggested orally that this recommendation be strengthened
                        to state categorically that the next Governor should be a civilian. We do
                        not know whether Commerce will press its point of view at this meeting.
                        There are no indications that Defense will raise the matter at this meeting.
                        We would prefer that the issue not be reopened for discussion and that the
                        proposed recommendation be adopted as is.</p>

                        Negotiations</p>
                    <p>This meeting affords an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the
                        negotiating mission entrusted to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> by the President. You might ask him to describe his
                        plans for consultation with the Congress and initiation of talks with
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>.</p>
                    <p>In this context it would be helpful if you would also note that the purpose
                        of the Memorandum to the President on negotiating strategy is not to limit
                        or restrict the flexibility or freedom of action of our negotiator, but
                        rather to facilitate his efforts by providing a set of actions which he can
                        draw upon at his discretion. It is not the Committee’s function to insert
                        itself into the negotiations themselves, nor to provide tactical suggestions
                        on how and when these actions may best be employed in the negotiations. <hi

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> made the following
                        key points during the meeting:</p>
                    <p>1. Panama, though on the surface complaining about the presence of US bases,
                        really accepts the fact that they must remain. The principal problem is
                        location, i.e., the fact that the bases are located on prime real estate in
                        downtown areas.</p>
                    <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> believes, and
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_PDS_1">Parker</persName> agrees, that the US
                        can relax on the jurisdictional issue by returning to Panama rights over
                        Panamanian citizens and business activities within the Canal Zone. This
                        subject was broached with Army Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1"
                            >Callaway</persName> who also agrees that we could relax, to some
                        extent, US controls. <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> does not
                        know, however, if he and <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName>
                        are on the same “frequency” regarding which controls and to what degree they
                        should be relaxed. A major issue under jurisdiction which <persName
                            corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> considers a particular thorn in the
                        Panamanians’ side is that they cannot tolerate Panamanian citizens being
                        tried in US courts on what is legally Panamanian territory.</p>
                    <p>3. Legally the United States is in a sticky position—the presence of US
                        military forces other than those required for the defense of the Canal
                        proper.</p>
                    <p>4. While publicly critical of US bases in general, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> takes pride in the US military
                        schools and wants them to remain.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> believes that Panama’s
                        actions in the United Nations were not and are not critical. But, he feels
                        the US is running higher risks in Panama than necessary over matters that
                        are not essential to the US. We have an obligation to manage the treaty
                        issue so this does not happen. It would do damage to the President
                        domestically.</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> agrees with Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1">Anderson</persName>’s position, outlined by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, that the Senate
                        probably would not take favorable <pb n="60" facs="0085" xml:id="pg_60"
                        />action on a full and complete treaty especially in this year and most
                        probably not until 1975.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Sayre</persName> believes the best way to
                        approach the negotiations is for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> to obtain <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> authority to
                        negotiate achievement of a new and more firm relationship with Panama,
                        whether that is by an overall treaty, a series of agreements, or some other
                        manner. He assumes Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        would begin by negotiating principles. Once obtained, he should attempt to
                        establish with Panama the position at which both countries should be at the
                        end of the tunnel (i.e., the concept of the new relationship) and then,
                        finally, to work out the details as to how to get to that position. This may
                        well require several treaties. It will also require a number of unilateral
                        executive actions and most certainly a packet of legislation.</p>

                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: These negotiations
                        have taken a very long time, but that is not altogether bad, for we have
                        come to know each other well over the years.</p>
                    <p>From time to time the positions of the two parties have seemed very close.
                        But then differences in interpretations of words pulled us apart. To
                        illustrate, the U.S. has said it seeks a “new agreement”. Panama of course
                        agrees with that. But occasionally the U.S. uses the word “revision”, and we
                        do not know what to think. We hold that the 1903 treaty is anachronistic and
                        must be abrogated, and to Latin Americans who are highly sensitive to
                        language usages, your use of the word “revision” seems to us you are trying
                        for something which only <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> new.</p>
                    <p>Panama, you know, is the only country in the world that looks in five rather
                        than four geographic directions. We look north, south, east and west, as
                        others. But we also have to look at the center—where the United States sits
                        among us.</p>
                    <p>Panama’s objective in the negotiations is clear and simple: we wish to
                        perfect our independence by reintegrating the Canal Zone into the life of
                        the Republic of Panama. Without that reintegration our independence will not
                        be complete.</p>
                    <p>We are, I assure you, aware of the great importance which the United States
                        attaches to the Canal Zone. We are not irresponsible. We are willing that
                        the U.S. should continue to administer the Canal Zone for a time. But we
                        must insist that your administration be civilian only in nature, and that it
                        be designed to serve the whole world.</p>
                    <p>We are interested in the most rapid negotiations possible. As you noted, Mr.
                        Secretary, former Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>
                        and I spoke of (eight) “principles”.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">See Tab A,
                                <ref target="#d13">Document 13</ref>.</note> Do you know, if we
                        could agree on those principles, <pb n="62" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_62"/>I
                        could dictate to my secretary the text of a treaty in less than a week’s
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: You will understand that I have just begun reading in on the
                        treaty problem, but I am already aware of the “principles” and they seem to
                        be an appropriate way to start.</p>
                    <p>I should like to make several points. First, I have assigned Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> to this task. He is our
                        most respected diplomat, a good personal friend in whom I have total
                        confidence, and he has direct access to me. I will personally watch the
                        course of negotiations, especially of course if there should be a deadlock.
                        I am not saying this out of politeness, but rather conviction.</p>
                    <p>If there is a settlement possible that is consistent with the needs of both
                        parties, we shall reach for it. We shall not delay difficult choices. Both
                        sides, perhaps, will have to make adjustments.</p>
                    <p>As for your comment on “revision”, let us settle everything first and then
                        decide what to call it.</p>
                    <p>I know you want a treaty for a fixed term, and we have no real problem with
                        that.</p>
                    <p>We are approaching this negotiation with the desire to bring it to a prompt
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>I would say, however, that we do not react very well to public pressure. We
                        must approach the talks honestly and quietly and seriously, and get them
                        done quickly.</p>
                    <p>I believe we can come out of this with a strengthened relationship—and, for
                        that, you cannot extort from us and we cannot impose our will on you.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: We very much
                        appreciate the significance of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>’s appointment, and we feel it important that he come
                        to Panama as soon as possible. President <persName corresp="#p_LBDB_1"
                            >Lakas</persName>, General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> and I will have open arms for him, and welcome him
                        with all the respect he merits.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I have to swear him in first (laughter).</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: We hope we may begin
                        our conversations soon.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: When do you go down, <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName>?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: In the last days of
                        October or early days of November.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Where will the negotiations take place? Will the two of you
                        negotiate together?</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: We shall negotiate
                        together, at least in the beginning. With respect to the locale, formerly
                        they were held almost exclusively in Washington, but it is important that
                        they now be held in Panama, for that instills much-needed confidence in our
                        people.</p>
                    <pb n="63" facs="0088" xml:id="pg_63"/>
                    <p>The Secretary: Well, my only concern is that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> was separated from his wife for—what
                        was it, <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>, six years? And now
                        I have promised him he can have some family life. I would be grateful if you
                        would keep the human element in mind, so that I can keep my promise to the
                        Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: We have no problem
                        with having some of the negotiations held in Washington, although we would
                        hope that most of them could take place in Panama. We would want the
                        negotiations in Panama to be effective, of course, not simply symbolic.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Frankly I would appreciate your doing this for me. We abused
                        him badly in Vietnam. From the point of view of national policy we have no
                        problem with holding part of the negotiations in Panama.</p>
                    <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: We intend to make a
                        maximum effort to resolve this problem. It is, of course, not a juridicial
                        one, nor an economic one, but entirely a political one. We also want to
                        achieve the least complicated treaty possible. Our people will have to
                        understand the treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I understand some of Panama’s domestic political problems, but
                        if we do a good job then the outcome will be acceptable to the people of
                        both sides. Again, Mr. Foreign Minister, we approach this with good will and
                        a willingness to compromise.</p>
                    <p>(non-substantive interchange with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1"
                            >Boyd</persName>).</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Our spirit is constructive, Mr. Foreign Minister. I shall keep
                        a personal eye on the negotiations. And I shall be delighted to meet with
                        you further at any time you think it necessary, especially were there to be
                        a stalemate.</p>
                    <p>(parting courtesies).</p>

                            (D-Missouri), she said that the Government of Panama was not trustworthy
                            and that “the US must retain sovereignty.” She was, however, open to
                            certain unilateral actions to improve U.S.-Panamanian relations such as
                            the return of Old France Field to Panama. (Ibid.) For <persName

                                <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>As for himself, the Congressman thinks the Canal is not vital to American
                        security but significant for international commerce; that Panamanian
                        nationalism has its legitimate side; and that concessions are in order.
                        Information reaching him indicates, he said, that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has become disenchanted with
                        confrontational tactics and may be ready to negotiate “rationally”. If the
                        Ambassador finds that to be the case, he should try very hard to conclude
                        the negotiations in a matter of weeks, not years—and “before something
                        happens to make positions <pb n="65" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_65"/>harden
                        further still”. “What most of us who follow Panama want is a <hi
                            rend="italic">solution</hi>, not dragged-out negotiations”, he
                        concluded, and offered his assistance and that of his SubCommittee to the
                        Ambassador.</p>

                    <p>The Senator said that, except for a hardcore of perhaps no more than ten
                        members, the Senate would be almost certain to view sympathetically a new
                        treaty relationship with Panama, provided (a) it had ample Administration
                        support and (b) it provided for what the Senator described as the
                        rock-bottom U.S. needs: the ability to control, technically, the Canal plant
                        itself, and to defend it. He added that virtually all of the Zone except for
                        the waterway itself, including most of the Armed Forces contingent, could
                        and should disappear. “Perpetuity and sovereignty and the exercise of
                        jurisdiction over foreign nationals—these are out of step with the mood of
                        the world and, especially, the mood of the American people”. Even “hardline
                        national security-conscious” senators like Jackson,<note n="3"

                        Canal issue if political tranquility is to be maintained.</p>
                    <p>2) General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> began interview
                        at his residence at Farallon by stating he was optimistic over possibility
                        of reaching agreement with USG on new Canal treaty. Secretary said he was
                        optimistic also. He mentioned his conversations with other GOP officials and
                        said he was pleased with unanimous agreement on both GOP and USG sides that
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> was excellent
                        choice as negotiator. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said
                        that he had used <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> appointment
                        as indication to his people USG serious about resolving Canal problem and
                        had raised Panama to priority USG had previously given to resolving problem
                        with Viet Cong. Later in conversation <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1"
                            >Callaway</persName> returned to this, noted <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> had spoken in humorous vein, but
                        wanted <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> to know U.S.
                        regarded highly its friendly relations with Panama, held the Panamanian
                        people and its leaders in high regard, and that there was really no basis
                        for comparison between Panama and Viet Cong.</p>
                    <p>3) <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> reviewed briefly his
                        inspection of Canal installations, noted how well Americans and Panamanians
                        worked together, and also observed both were pressing him for higher pay and
                        more benefits. <pb n="67" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_67"/>Costs were rising and
                        he was considering a toll increase. (<persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> made no comment on this.) He expressed satisfaction
                        with <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss>–US armed forces cooperation noting
                        specifically group of US soldiers receiving paratroop training at a <gloss
                            target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> base. He commended Panama’s positive
                        approach on treaty negotiations and said he believed he understood issues
                        which are important to Panama—national dignity, jurisdiction and increased
                        ability to benefit from Canal. He hoped <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> understood great pride of US in Canal which was
                        “moonshot” of early part of this century. He was also certain <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> understood prime importance USG
                        attaches to maintenance, operation and defense of Canal.</p>
                    <p>4) <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> thanked the Secretary
                        for his comments. There was one major problem in negotiations which had to
                        be dealt with urgently. For the next twenty minutes <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> pressed forcefully his obviously
                        strongly held view that Panama had been patient for ten years and he (as
                        head of GOP) for five years without any results. The people, students
                        especially, had no faith in negotiations. Patience was running out. He could
                        not hold out much longer. He had to show results. USG had to do something
                        significant to show its good faith. After several repetitions I asked him
                        specifically what he had in mind. He said <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> had explained that in Washington.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">See <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>.</note> I
                        said that I was aware of these suggestions; they had to be approved by
                        Congress; and it was not likely Congress could act before January 9. I asked
                        if the joint patrols would do it. He replied negatively saying joint patrols
                        were risky so long as Canal Zone authorities persisted in their view of
                        jurisdiction. Both Secretary and I tried to make clear that Zone authorities
                        were carrying out orders from Washington and they could only change their
                        actions when GOP and USG reached new understanding on jurisdictional
                        concept.</p>
                    <p>5) Secretary noted there were extremists on both sides. U.S. President had
                        same problem as <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. It was
                        easy to inflame either side but he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> that this would return us to point zero. Situation
                        was opportune to move forward constructively and positive attitude taken by
                        Panama made Congress more receptive than it had been for some time.</p>
                    <p>6) <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> returned to his point
                        that he needed something significant and posed possibility of Presidential
                        declaration of principles indicating acceptance of Panama’s aspirations. In
                        response Secretary asked if Presidential announcement of intention to seek
                        legislation for significant concessions would do it. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> thought it might if it were for
                        something really significant. Then <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> asked why USG did not <pb n="68" facs="0093"
                            xml:id="pg_68"/>ask this “ghost” it continually parades to approve
                        something and see what happened. Why don’t you ask Congress to approve use
                        of Panamanian license plates on all Zone automobiles? He pressed this hard
                        and then retreated somewhat with the observation that he did not want us to
                        think that that would solve the problem. “It would help show your good will
                        and give me something to use with the people but it would have to be done in
                        such a way that I would not be accused of negotiating for five years and
                        only getting the USG to use Panamanian plates,” he said.</p>
                    <p>7) <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> said that he understood
                        the point on demonstration of good will but he was certain USG negotiators
                        would not want to be accused of giving away significant bargaining points.
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> retorted that he had
                        maintained calm in Panama for five years and that he was entitled to some
                        return for all of his effort and good will.</p>
                    <p>8) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> emphasized that
                        Panama should not expect immediate results from <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>’s visit in November.<note n="5" xml:id="d24fn5">See
                                <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>.</note> He understood first
                        visit was for purpose of learning about issues first hand with object of
                        developing his own views on how to proceed. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> said he understood <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>’s capabilities and Panama did not expect miracles.
                        But then he recalled biblical account of “fishes and loaves”, after Jesus
                        had been talking to followers even they grew impatient and wanted to be fed.
                        Panama had now been listening for ten years and he for five and he had to
                        have some fuel (a significant concession) to recharge his tank.</p>
                    <p>9) <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> appeared to have
                        exhausted points he wanted to make and I told him I had been trying to
                        arrange meeting with him to thank him for his action on Villa case.<note
                            n="6" xml:id="d24fn6">See <ref target="#d3fn7">footnote 7, Document
                                3</ref>.</note> I noted that there was joke among us U.S. and
                        Panamanians about him being best lawyer Villa had. I said that I wanted to
                        present him with agreed honorarium. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> relaxed somewhat during this exchange and was
                        pleased.</p>
                    <p>10) <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said he was entirely

                        hint that he considered his ability to remain in power depended on his
                        performance on this issue. He mentioned again his satisfaction that <gloss

                        position on the Canal issue, and who travels abroad with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>, agreed some weeks ago to
                        gather impressions of (a) his personal views on the issue and (b) the role
                        he might play in decision-making within Defense on the issue. The following
                        are his findings.</p>
                    <p>Instinctively, and as a generalized matter, the Secretary is worried at the
                        apparently relentless erosion of American power positions abroad.
                        Specifically he thinks of the Canal and the Zone as comprising one which
                        should and need not be allowed to erode.</p>
                    <p>That sentiment was intensified by his difficulties in mounting the re-supply
                        airlift to Israel. When country after country denied permission for
                        refueling stops, and even Portugal hesitated before permitting use of the
                        Azores, the Secretary was dismayed at how tenuous our worldwide LOC (lines
                        of communication) are, and became more interested in preserving those such
                        as the Canal which we have.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">A reference to
                            Operation Nickel Grass, which resupplied Israel during the October 1973

                    <p>He is also aware—though vaguely—that the Joint Chiefs are about to approve a
                        “comprehensive” study of the strategic value of the Canal which asserts that
                        while it has little value for Atlantic operations it is <pb n="70"
                            facs="0095" xml:id="pg_70"/>critical for Pacific ones.<note n="4"

                        (Comment: Other friends in Defense have said things from which I infer that
                        there is a rush on to have the Chiefs “red stripe” this study, so that it
                        will be there to confront you and the President when and if you were to
                        recommend major concessions. But this is my inference only).</p>
                    <p>Yet the Secretary’s intellect is such that “once he has let off steam” he
                        will recognize that the Administration would not wish to run the domestic as
                        well as international risks of another blow-up in Panama; that our
                        “colonialism” is markedly out of step with the times; that there is
                        legitimacy to Panama’s nationalist movement; and that there is a certain
                        American-style “rightness” in returning to Panama rights and properties we
                        no longer require but Panama needs.</p>
                    <p>It takes a special effort to switch on that intellectual approach—not just
                        educational diplomacy, but also some effort to “reach” his particular
                        personality.</p>
                    <p>The effort is worthwhile because no one can as a practical matter reverse
                            <gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss>’s position on the Canal except the
                        Secretary, not even Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"

                        Secretary, with the President’s specific blessing.</p>
                    <p>Also, since the Middle East crisis the Defense Secretary and Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> have become very
                        close. Were Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> to
                        remain unalterably opposed to a forthcoming attitude vis-à-vis Panama, that
                        would count a good deal with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Soundings I have taken elsewhere in Defense tend to confirm the foregoing
                        analysis: the Secretary is tough on Panama but not irreversibly.</p>

                            >Torrijos</persName> in managing his domestic problem, Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has recommended that the
                        Secretary, with Defense’s concurrence, ask the President to announce before
                        January 9, the 10th anniversary of Canal Zone riots, the U.S. Government’s
                        intention to seek legislation transferring to Panama title and jurisdiction
                        over two pieces of abandoned Canal Zone land.<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5"

                    <p rend="center">I. Summary—Introduction</p>
                    <p>1. As working-level representatives Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Gonzalez Revilla</persName> and I agreed to and signed December 19 a
                        set of eight principles, ad referendum to the chief negotiators. On Panama’s
                        part the principles are as a practical matter ad referendum to no one since
                        the Foreign Minister and the Chief of Government have both approved them
                        personally.</p>
                    <p>2. From the following description you will note that during this negotiation
                        Panama receded from its position on all points of major concern to the
                        United States. That would seem to stand as additional evidence that Panama
                        is seeking a new treaty arrangement on terms markedly more acceptable to the
                        United States than any it has heretofore proposed.</p>
                    <p>3. Understandably the Panamanians are fearful they have accommodated the
                        United States in the principles to an extent such that they will be charged
                        publicly and privately with what in this country amounts to treason. Their
                        fears are the greater for the fact that the opposition of economic interest
                        groups to the regime is growing and so, in proportion, is the skittishness
                        of the National Guard. They tell me that as a result it is now imperative
                        for you to appear in Panama before January 9. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> sent word that any unilateral action the United
                        States might be contemplating would not suffice for his purposes in these
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. Description of Agreed Principles</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Principle One.</hi> Panama accepted verbatim the text of
                        the United States’ second proposal.</p>
                    <p>Comment. Panama thereby receded from the “two-treaty” position under which
                        one treaty abrogating the 1903 convention and thus restoring Panama’s
                        sovereignty over the Canal Zone would have been con<pb n="75" facs="0100"
                            xml:id="pg_75"/>cluded in advance of another treaty granting new rights
                        to the United States in the Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Principle Two.</hi> Panama had already accepted verbatim
                        the text of the United States’ second proposal.</p>
                    <p>Comment. None.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Principle Three.</hi> Panama accepted verbatim the text
                        of the United States’ second proposal.</p>
                    <p>Comment. Panama thereby appears to have receded from a position of general
                        opposition to retention by the United States of certain jurisdictional
                        functions in the Canal Zone, and from insistence that any jurisdictional
                        functions Panama might permit the United States to retain should cease
                        within a time period so brief as to be unacceptable to the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Principle Four.</hi> Panama accepted the text of the
                        United States’ second proposal with the following amendments:</p>
                    <p>A. Panama asked and I accepted that following the words “shall grant to the
                        United States of America” there be inserted the phraseology “for the
                        duration of the new interoceanic canal treaty and in accordance with what
                        that treaty states.”</p>
                    <p>B. Panama receded from its insistence on placing the word “strictly” before
                        the word “necessary” and I accepted, in substitution therefor, the
                        phraseology “which may be.”</p>
                    <p>Comment. Panama acceded thereby to the United States’ position requiring
                        reference to “defense” as well as to “protection” of the Canal; acceded to
                        the United States’ position that control of airspace is requisite to
                        adequate defense; and indicated by its willingness to eliminate the
                        restrictive qualifier “strictly” that it is no longer intent on possessing
                        ultimate authority over land usage in the Zone.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Principle Five.</hi> Panama accepted an offer on my part
                        which altered the text of the second United States proposal to read as
                        follows:</p>
                    <quote>Quote The Republic of Panama shall have a just and equitable share of the
                        benefits derived from the operation of the canal in its territory. It is
                        recognized that the geographic position of its territory constitutes the
                        principal resource of the Republic of Panama. End Quote.</quote>
                    <p>Comment. Panama receded from its insistence on characterizing as a “natural
                        resource” the geographic position of its territory, which would have had the
                        effect of subjecting the United States to the confines of a United Nations
                        Resolution asserting that a “natural resource” can be exploited under the
                        ultimate control of the territorial sovereign. Panama also receded in effect
                        from its position that the United States should make annual payments to
                        Panama based not only on canal revenues but also on the value attributable
                        to usage by the United States of its territory.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Principle Six.</hi> On no <pb n="76" facs="0101"
                            xml:id="pg_76"/>other point was Panama so adamant as on its opposition
                        to inclusion of any language whatever which would accord the United States
                        rights “to conduct related activities.” Therein, as Panama explained, it
                        perceived “the perpetuation of the Southern Command, the commercial
                        enterprises, and all the other things that have nothing to do with operating
                        and defending a waterway and are utterly abhorrent to the Panamanian
                        people.” Panama was not much less adamant, however, in opposing inclusion of
                        language which would accord the United States not only the basic
                        jurisdictional rights but also “privileges and immunities.” It perceived
                        those words as indicative of a desire on the part of the United States to
                        retain colonialist perquisites and trappings.</p>
                    <p>I accepted exclusion of “privileges and immunities”, since specification of
                        them is hardly essential in a statement of principles and since the United
                        States remains free to seek them in the negotiating process. Panama
                        thereupon accepted my proposed language which grants to the United States
                        the right to operate, maintain, protect and defend the canal “and to
                        undertake any other specific activity related to those ends, as may be
                        agreed upon in the treaty.”</p>
                    <p>Panama also objected vigorously to inclusion of rights for the United States
                        to regulate “the passage of traffic” through the canal, but ultimately
                        accepted phraseology permitting regulation of “the transit of ships.”</p>
                    <p>Panama asked that the statements referring to its participation in the
                        administration of the canal be placed at the first rather than at the last
                        of the principle, and I accepted that restructuring, as well as inclusion of
                        phraseology asserting that Panama’s participation will be “in accordance
                        with a procedure to be agreed upon in the treaty.”</p>
                    <p>Comment. Panama’s acceptance of the substance of the second United States
                        proposal, taken in conjunction with its verbatim acceptance of Principle
                        Two, would seem to remove any doubt that Panama is at last prepared to
                        permit the United States to possess the basic rights it has been seeking for
                        continued canal operation and defense.</p>
                    <p>Panama’s position that its participation in canal administration should be a
                        “growing” one did not prevail.</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Principle Seven.</hi> Panama accepted the verbatim text
                        of the second United States proposal.</p>
                    <p>Comment. Panama thereby receded from the position that its armed forces
                        should not only “participate” in canal protection and defense but also join
                        in the “exercise of responsibilities” relating thereto. Thus the full rights
                        and responsibilities for canal defense are preserved for the United
                        States.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s recent talks in
                        Panama were highly positive. An entirely new and favorable climate has been
                        created for continuing negotiations. The talks also disclosed a new
                        flexibility on the part of the Panamanians regarding the Canal negotiations.
                        The prospects seem good for resolving this long-standing issue within the
                        next year.</p>
                    <pb n="78" facs="0103" xml:id="pg_78"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposed Actions:</p>
                    <p>We need to sustain the momentum generated in the renewed talks. We can, at
                        the same time, minimize the risks of any spontaneous Panamanian actions
                        against the Zone similar to those that occurred in 1964. The 10th
                        anniversary of those riots will be on January 9.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has recommended—with

                        addition to improving the negotiating climate, these gestures would reduce
                        international criticism of our position in the Zone and serve as additional
                        evidence that our “new look” at Latin America has been initiated and is
                        producing results.</p>
                    <p>The gestures would involve announcing your intention to seek legislation next
                        year authorizing Executive Agreements that would: (1) transfer title and
                        jurisdiction to Panama over two small airstrips the US no longer requires,
                        and (2) authorize Panama’s national lottery to operate in the Zone. The
                        Defense Department agrees that transfer of the airstrips would not diminish
                        in any way our ability to operate and defend the Canal.</p>
                    <p>A small number of members of Congress oppose making any concessions to
                        Panama, now or ever. They might be tempted to attach riders to the proposed
                        legislation aimed at limiting the US negotiating position regarding any new
                        treaty. However, based on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>’s consultations to date with key congressional
                            leaders,<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">See <ref target="#d22">Documents
                                22</ref> and <ref target="#d23">23</ref>.</note> we are confident
                        such efforts would not succeed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> will be meeting again with congressional leaders to
                        prepare the way for your announcement before he returns to Panama after
                        Christmas.</p>
                    <p>We hope the US-Panama talks can be resumed on December 26 or 27. A White
                        House announcement of the measures described above will be most important to
                        the success of this second round and will enhance our negotiating position.
                        For maximum impact, the announcement should be made December 27 or 28.<note

                    <p>I. Introduction—Summary</p>
                    <p>This second engagement with the Panamanians on Contadora Island was brief but
                        beneficial.</p>
                    <p>It relieved apprehension that the Panama negotiation was slipping on the
                        scale of American foreign-policy priorities.</p>
                    <p>It accented the new “forthcoming” posture of the United States toward Panama,
                        revealed to the Panamanians in the announcement from San Clemente December
                        28 of unilateral actions intended to modernize our operations in the Canal
                            Zone.<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">On December 28, 1973, the White House
                            announced that it would proceed with several unilateral actions to
                            improve U.S.-Panamanian relations. See <ref target="#d28fn4">footnote 4,
                                Document 28</ref>.</note> It permitted putting final touches to the
                        eight “principles” which the Foreign Minister and I initialed as chief

                    <p>I believe it also provided evidence available for your use in Mexico in that

                            attended the Conference of Tlatelolco in Mexico City February 20–24
                            where he met with the Latin American Foreign Ministers. The conference
                            was held to discuss the “New Dialogue” with Latin America that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had proposed at the United
                            Nations in October 1973. The Declaration of Tlatelolco issued on
                            February 24 “welcomed” the signing of the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                    <p>It also provided agreement on a reasonable scenario for the conduct of future
                        negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Lastly it led to confirmation that there is a negotiating momentum here which
                        we ought not to allow to falter. I believe these developments in the shorter
                        run will relieve some of the foreign pressures upon you, but they may create
                        some domestic pressures. For the longer run they will make it easier to move
                        into true treaty negotiation, but they should not obscure the difficulties
                        of reconciling disparities between what I characterize as Panamanian and
                        American nationalism on the issue of the Panama Canal.</p>

                        your personal interest in the Panama negotiation, and on this count the
                        Panamanians now seem content.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4"><persName

                            responsibility required him to postpone talks with Panama from December
                            27, 1973, to January 6, 1974. (Telegram 250666 to Panama City, December

                        as entirely natural that once we complete the “joint statement of
                        principles” exercise, the deputy negotiators should take over for a
                        protracted period.</p>
                    <p>III. Unilateral U.S. Actions</p>
                    <p>The Panamanians were impressed at the December 28 announcement from San
                        Clemente that the President will seek legislation delivering into Panamanian
                        hands two airstrips in the Canal Zone and the authority to operate the
                        lottery there.</p>
                    <p>I believe that announcement provides you with the first part of the two-part
                        evidence you would have available for use in Mexico in February that the
                        “new dialogue” with Latin America has been promptly initiated and as
                        promptly productive.</p>
                    <p>You would be able to characterize these legislative requests as having
                        derived from the frank, informal talks you asked me to under<pb n="81"
                            facs="0106" xml:id="pg_81"/>take with the Panamanians, fulfilling your
                        October 5 commitment that no treaty arrangement in the Americas would be
                        beyond examination.<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">See <ref target="#d21"
                                >Document 21</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>There was of course justification for proceeding with the unilateral actions
                        in order to help General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        keep his domestic political house tranquil while we negotiate. Yet it was
                        the revelation of a new Panamanian flexibility of negotiation during my
                        first visit here—confirmed during a subsequent visit of my deputy for Panama
                        matters—which more than any other factor occasioned my recommendation to you
                        that we proceed with the legislative requests.</p>
                    <p>IV. Agreement on Principles</p>
                    <p>The second part of the evidence would consist of the “Joint Statement” you
                        plan to initial with Panama’s Foreign Minister. As you recall the deputy
                        negotiators had worked out and initialed in mid-December a set of eight
                        principles, ad referendum to the chief negotiators and, thereafter, to

                        heretofore reserved; a willingness that the United States should continue to
                        possess the attributes, some jurisdictional, central to operation and
                        defense of the basic waterway.</p>
                    <p>What appears to be concessionary on the United States’ part is in fact a
                        complex of movements we have been prepared to make for some time. These
                        movements, such as enabling Panama’s “participation” in the administration
                        and defense of the Canal, lie entirely within the existing Presidential
                        guidelines and commit the United States to nothing except to work out the
                        fashion of Panamanian participation in a new treaty.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting that Panama made still another concessionary gesture
                        respecting the principles during this visit. In the deputies’ version of
                        principle 8, dealing with the right of the United States ultimately to
                        expand Canal capacity should it so desire, there had been incorporated
                        phraseology which legal counsel in Washington feared could be interpreted as
                        giving Panama too decisive a voice in a decision on Canal expansion and,
                        hence, as contravening existing Presidential instructions. While I myself
                        regarded the phraseology as suitably ambiguous, and in any case should
                        certainly not have agreed to any dilution of this U.S. right when the moment
                        of drafting of treaty articles arrived, mindful of counsels’ concerns, I
                        suggested to the Foreign Minister alternative phraseology—previously cleared
                        fully in Washington and preferred by the Department of Defense—to eliminate
                        the ambiguity in our favor. That was not at all easy for him to accept, as
                        Panama has always hoped for a strong measure of mutuality in the
                        decision-making <pb n="82" facs="0107" xml:id="pg_82"/>regarding Canal
                        expansion. Moreover, it was politically most difficult for the Foreign
                        Minister that I “reopened” the principles agreement at all. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and many other key private and
                        public Panamanians had approved the deputies’ version, and the government
                        was but two days away from the tenth anniversary on January 9 of the student
                        riots a decade ago.</p>
                    <p>But he did accept it, though he added a few frills for Panamanian public
                        consumption purposes to which I had no objection. He did so, it is worth
                        noting, without seeking compensating U.S. concessions in the “package deal”
                        of principles which I had reopened. The text of the new principle 8 is set
                        out at the end of this message.</p>
                    <p>From the Minister’s acceptance and from conversations held on the subject I
                        take it that Panama has no longer, if indeed it truly ever had, an intent
                        seriously to circumscribe this U.S. right. Panama only does not wish to be
                        left out in the cold respecting massive foreign construction activity on its
                        territory and I must say I cannot fault it for that.</p>
                    <p>With that textual amendment we initialed the principles document in our
                        capacities as chief negotiators and it now awaits ministerial-level
                            approval.<note n="7" xml:id="d29fn7">The final text of the joint

                    <p>On the question of Congressional reaction, you will recall that I tested the
                        mood of key members of both houses before my first visit to Panama, and
                        again before the San Clemente announcement of the unilateral legislative
                        requests. My impression thus far is that moderate opinion will prevail on
                        Panama issues, provided of course that there is an adequacy of
                        administration support.</p>
                    <p>Referring back to the “evidence” available for your possible use in Mexico,
                        the fact that the two countries had been able in under two months to reach
                        agreement through quiet bilateral conversation on principles critical to a
                        new treaty; the fact that the agreement would surely be recognized to have
                        resulted not from Panamanian extortion nor United States imposition but from
                        compromising; and the fact that the principles could be read to indicate a
                        shedding by the United States of the allegedly “colonialist” trappings in
                        the Canal Zone—those facts might go far toward deflating the Latin American
                        and other statesmen who have criticized the manner of our presence in the
                        Zone and sought to multilateralize the Panama issue.</p>

                    <p>V. Text of the “Joint Statement”</p>
                    <p>As for the “preamble” to the enumeration of the principles, I had thought we
                        might keep it brief so as not excessively to raise Panamanian expectations
                        nor American fears. I had also thought highly of <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJB_1">Jack Kubisch</persName>’s suggestion that you and
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> could then
                        read individual statements at the moment of signature which would reflect
                        the particular sentiments and policies of the two governments. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>, for example, could speak of the
                        principles as a milestone in the long march toward the perfection of
                        Panama’s independence, and you could speak of them as not solely an
                        operative act in the negotiation process but also as a guidepost to the way
                        in which the United States wishes to move in this hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>I handed the Minister a draft text of a preamble (which had been cleared in
                        Washington in a more extensive version), saying it represented “personal
                        thoughts” only and requesting his comments. The Minister seemed to be
                        attracted to this procedure, is studying the “thoughts”, and presumably will
                        have editorial revisions to suggest.</p>
                    <p>Once he and I have some agreement on this statement, I shall forward it
                        formally to you together with the “final” version of the principles and a
                        suggested draft of the individual statement you might make.</p>
                    <p>VI. Scenario for the Future</p>
                    <p>I believe it fair to say from this last visit that there is now a negotiating
                        momentum—substantive and, as importantly, psychological—which has not
                        existed for a time and which should be sustained if this problem is to be
                        settled amicably and in the not undiscernible future. That is especially so
                        because, as is often the case in such expeditions, the momentum itself helps
                        measurably to surmount quite difficult obstacles ahead.</p>
                    <p>And it is primarily for the United States to do the sustaining. Despite the
                        rapport and trust which I take to have been created recently, the
                        Panamanians remain a little doubting<note n="8" xml:id="d29fn8">In telegram

                        of fruitless negotiation and of general United States inattentiveness have
                        induced; also, they will be subject to occasional fits of fear that in the
                        negotiations the United States is, somehow or another, doing them in, and it
                        will be necessary to tranquilize them. On occasion that may require somewhat
                        more than constant reassurance that the United States does not have motives
                        or goals in <pb n="84" facs="0109" xml:id="pg_84"/>the negotiations which
                        are not apparent from the American negotiators’ words. Accordingly I
                        suggested to the Foreign Minister that following the announcement of the
                        joint statement our deputies should begin meeting, in Panama City and
                        Washington, to put some flesh on the bones of the eight principles. Once
                        they had done so, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement, the
                        Minister and I could meet again to negotiate our differences and approve the
                        papers. Those would then stand as firm instructions for the drafting of
                        actual treaty articles. The Minister agreed. He added that he would wish to
                        return compliments by journeying to Washington for the next engagement.</p>

                        existing presidential guidelines to incorporate provisions guaranteeing that
                        upon the treaty’s termination the Canal will remain open to all world
                        shipping without discrimination at reasonable tolls, and that Panama will
                        not hamper the Canal’s efficient operation. In the Ambassador’s judgment
                        that provision, and many other provisions of interest to the United States,
                        constituted details which were not suitable for inclusion in a statement of

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problem:</p>
                    <p>There are approximately 5,500 American and 16,000 Panamanian U.S. Government
                        employees working in the Canal Zone. Each time there is any indication of
                        movement in treaty negotiations, Canal Zone employees become uneasy about
                        their status. In order to forestall possible employee protest over the
                        signing of the Statement of Principles, I propose to give a letter to the
                        Governor of the Canal Zone, which he can use to reassure Canal Zone
                        employees.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                    <p>Canal Zone employees have been uneasy about their status since 1964 when the
                        U.S. undertook to revise its treaty relationship with Panama. The Joint

                            >Robles</persName> in 1964 contained a reference to the status of Canal

                        <p>The signing of a Joint Statement of Principles by the Governments of the
                            United States and Panama today is an important step for both countries
                            in laying the basis for a new and modern treaty arrangement.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of the Secretary of State, I would like to take this
                            opportunity to assure you that this action in no way changes the status
                            of U.S. Government employees in the Canal Zone. The Principles are
                            intended to provide a framework for future negotiation of a treaty which
                            will be subject to congressional consultation and eventual ratification
                            processes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and I fully recognize the vital contribution that employees
                            of the Zone and Company are making to the continued efficient operation
                            of the Canal, and are attentive to the need to treat these employees
                            fairly and judiciously. Appropriate arrangements will be made to ensure
                            that their rights and interests are safeguarded. Whatever the changes
                            agreed upon in the final treaty that will affect <pb n="88" facs="0113"
                                xml:id="pg_88"/>employees, they will take place over a period long
                            enough to obviate or minimize personal hardship. <note n="7"

                                maintaining employee morale. At the same time, however, I think we
                                must start indoctrinating our employees with the idea that changes
                                of some sort are coming in our relationships with Panama. The

                    <p>1. (U) Reference is made to a memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of
                        Defense (International Security Affairs), I–154/74, dated 8 January 1974,
                        subject as above.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">In the January 8 memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTH_1">Moorer</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PR_1">Peet</persName> requested that the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> produce a study on the military
                            strategic importance of the Canal. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                    <p>2. (S) As requested by the reference, a classified study on the military
                        strategic importance of the Panama Canal, which includes treatment of
                        specific topics, is contained in the Appendix hereto.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d33fn3">The study, undated, is attached but not printed.</note>
                        The study concludes:</p>
                    <p>a. That the Panama Canal is a major defense asset, the use of which is
                        necessary to enhance US capability for timely reinforcement in Asia <pb
                            n="90" facs="0115" xml:id="pg_90"/>and in Europe during periods of
                        conflict. Its strategic advantage lies in the economy and flexibility it
                        provides to accelerate the shift of military forces and logistic support by
                        sea between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and to overseas areas.</p>
                    <p>b. That a lock canal or a new sea-level canal will continue to be of
                        importance to national security.</p>
                    <p>c. Panama has the capability to threaten the Panama Canal itself, but the
                        probability of such action is low at present.</p>
                    <p>d. A potential threat will continue to exist to the longer alternate ocean
                        lines of communication around Africa and South America. At the present time,
                        the Soviet Union is considered the only nation with such a capability.</p>
                    <p>3. (C) It is understood that the study is intended for use as the basis for a
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>input to the pending
                        Interdepartmental Group (American Regional Affairs) study on this

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Responded that the
                        Panamanians may expect too much by way of U.S. concession.</p>
                    <p>Vice President: Issued a strong concern about the attitude on Capitol Hill
                        and cautioned that State may be over-optimistic about the Hill.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Will advise Panama of the
                        Hill attitude.</p>
                    <p>Vice President: Told <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> to
                        caution Panama—no more concessions because they will cause problems
                        here.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Said he felt there was a
                        change of mind in Panama—more realistic attitude of not demanding too
                        much.</p>
                    <p>Vice President: Cautioned <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>
                        there was no U.S. constituency to help you and that this is a type issue
                        that can be used against an incumbent member. He emphasized it was a
                        challenger’s issue.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Indicated his concern that if
                        we don’t make some moves, violence could erupt in Panama which might require
                        strong U.S. countermeasures. If some progress is desirable we can avoid this
                        eruption.</p>
                    <p>Vice President: Inquired about the status of the second canal.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Responded there was no
                        progress—it was not a key issue in the negotiations. He did point out that
                        the present canal, because of its size, limits traffic.</p>
                    <p>There was a short exchange on the use of nuclear explosion for construction
                        purposes (Plow Share).<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Operation Plowshare was a

                        the Vice President to discuss the Panama situation. He said the atmosphere
                        in Panama was better, but could recognize lines were being drawn on Capitol
                        Hill with strong opposition from <persName corresp="#p_FDJ_1">Dan
                            Flood</persName> and his followers.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President urged that there be no further announcements about Panama
                        this year, and can shoot for 1975 as the year of decision and
                        implementation.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said that <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>had been very helpful, but agreed there
                        were problems ahead.</p>
                    <p>Reference to the negotiations he said we were asking for 50 years on the
                        Canal but Panama wanted a termination end of 1999. By termination, this
                        means they will get the Canal and the Zone. In the meantime, there will be a
                        phasing-in of Panama jurisdiction. As a part of the arrangements, we are
                        seeking to build a new sea level canal or to expand the old canal, but with
                        an extension of time for operations.</p>
                    <pb n="93" facs="0118" xml:id="pg_93"/>
                    <p>Sea level canal through Nicaragua or Colombia is not practical, but it is
                        necessary to have a new facility or a modernized old facility since the
                        present canal will not accommodate some of the larger vessels.</p>
                    <p>A sticking point in the negotiations is the Colombian right under the 1914

                    <p>I should be less than honest—and that I shall not be, with you—if I did not
                        say that I was disappointed on reading the paper dated March 19 which Nico

                            22 phone conversation, Bell and Blacken discussed the Panamanian paper.
                            Bell described it as “highly nationalistic, accusatory, vilifying, and a
                            few other unattractive things.” (National Archives, <gloss

                    <p>You will understand that it is difficult for us not to regard it as

                        of Panama made known to us in December of 1972 and, therefore, as not

                    <p>To deal with a paper of this nature, I fear it would be necessary to form
                        teams of lawyers and historians, rather than to pursue the type of political

                    <p>It may well be that we are not correct in our interpretation of this
                        document, and for that reason I have decided that Morey should proceed to
                        Panama to discuss with Nico—and, I would hope, with you—the manner in which
                        we can proceed, on a basis of mutual trust. I should add that I am looking
                        forward very much to the opportunity to discuss this problem with you, but
                        wish to emphasize that Morey has my complete confidence for the purpose of

                    <p>The Vice President: Mr. Minister, it is nice to see you. I am extremely
                        grateful for your taking time to come and see me.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Mr. Vice President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to
                        see you, especially since I know of the numerous commitments you have.</p>
                    <p>May I convey to you the greetings of the President of Panama, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_LBDB_1">Lakas</persName>, and of the Chief of Government,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>.</p>
                    <p>We in Panama have followed closely the Vice President’s brilliant career in
                        the Congress and we are fully aware of his dedication to his nation and his
                        service to it.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: Thank you very much Mr. Minister. I must say in the last
                        five months my life style has changed quite a lot.</p>
                    <p>I want you to know that I have always kept abreast of these negotiations.
                        Indeed, I have followed them all throughout Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_ARB_1">Anderson</persName>’s tenure. I know that both
                        parties have worked extremely hard at this.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Yes, we have been working very hard indeed—in fact, we have
                        been working ten years now, but with no success. The <pb n="96" facs="0121"
                            xml:id="pg_96"/>success began with Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s appointment and since that event
                        we have advanced in a very substantive manner toward a treaty.</p>
                    <p>I want you to know that the people in the Government of Panama have
                        confidence in the present leadership of the United States—in President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, yourself, the Secretary
                        of State, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. They
                        have all demonstrated a deep knowledge and, in fact, understanding of our
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: The fact that the President has given this assignment to
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> indicates how
                        important this negotiation is to him. After all, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> is the foremost American diplomat
                        and he never gets the easy tasks. In fact, I don’t think he’s ever had an
                        easy task. (Laughter).</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Yes, and now they have put him in charge of two canals.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: I remember that in the mid-50’s there was a revision of
                        the treaty. I believe it had something to do with an increase in
                        payment.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Yes. That was the 1955 Treaty which revised the 1903 Treaty. We
                        have agreed now that we shall abrogate the 1903 Treaty and arrive at an
                        entirely new one.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: I fully support the President’s efforts to find new
                        answers to this problem. A new treaty is desirable from the viewpoint of
                        both parties. But, of course, there are difficulties, as you know, with a
                        treaty in the Congress. A two-thirds vote is required in the Senate by the
                        Constitution. In the House, the interest is indirect, but I can tell you
                        that the interest is very vocal indeed. (laughter).</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Yes, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> told me recently that the letters which he
                        received opposing his policy with respect to the treaty are so many that he
                        thought there were probably several million people living in the Canal Zone
                        itself. I told him that there were only some 40,000, and he said, Well they
                        still make lots of noise. (laughter).</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: To be candid, I have watched very carefully the reaction
                        in the House over the years. There is a group led by my good friend
                            <persName corresp="#p_FDJ_1">Dan Flood</persName>, but there are others
                        too. More recently, I was surprised at the resolution in the Senate in
                        opposition to the treaty which received support from 34 Senators.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d37fn2">Senate Resolution 301, sponsored by Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_TJS_1">Strom Thurmond</persName> (R-South Carolina), was
                            introduced on March 29. See <ref target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note>
                        This is, of course, more than one-third. And if there is not the right kind
                        of agreement, then we are in for trouble. Another point is that I was
                        surprised at the bi-partisan nature of that resolution.</p>
                    <pb n="97" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_97"/>
                    <p>The Minister: Well, the position of the negotiators is very difficult. Each
                        has to defend his country’s interests, but both are committed to a new
                        treaty so that as a matter of practice we have to take all elements in both
                        countries into account.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: Yes, I am sure you have no unanimity of view in your
                        country, either, just as we do not in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The fact of the matter is, if we want a treaty, then we have to find an
                        answer that satisfies two-thirds of the Senate.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: I understand that. This Government is willing to take the
                        political decisions necessary to reach an agreement which we hope will be
                        acceptable to the Congress. We have made a great deal of progress since we
                        have stopped consulting the lawyers in our country.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: Well, I am surprised we have gotten as close as we have
                        on some very difficult issues.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Yes, and we have done that despite the fact that there are 1.5
                        million negotiators in Panama—that is, the entire Panamanian population.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: I suppose you have some very loud ones too.
                        (laughter).</p>
                    <p>The Minister: We are convinced that we are now on the road toward achieving a
                        just and equitable treaty. Of course, it is fundamental that the treaty
                        include nothing that will cause conflicts between the two countries in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: I certainly agree with that. It is not in the interest of
                        either side to have elements in the new treaty which would undermine our
                        future relations.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: I believe that for the United States the best security for the
                        Canal is to have friends on both sides of it.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: There is no question about that. It would be a very, very
                        unstable situation from our point of view if things were otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Let me be clear, Mr. Minister. I believe that the majority of our people
                        basically want a solution to this problem. However, they of course do not
                        know all of the details and many of those details are extremely difficult so
                        the task ahead is going to be arduous.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: Mr. Vice President, my entire visit here has been very positive
                        and useful and I intend to tell that to the President of Panama and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. May I hope that you,
                        Mr. Vice President, will on some occasion have an opportunity to visit our
                        country. It would be a great honor for us.</p>
                    <p>The Vice President: I have been in your country once, for about 24 hours, on
                        a Navy carrier passing through the Canal, and I would <pb n="98" facs="0123"
                            xml:id="pg_98"/>like to go back some time. As you know, a very dear
                        friend of mine, Congressman Bow, had been appointed Ambassador, but
                        unfortunately died before he could arrive in Panama, and I had intended to
                        visit him.</p>
                    <p>I wish you would convey my respects and my gratitude for that kind invitation
                        to visit your country to your President and the Chief of Government. I would
                        hope to be able to travel to Latin America once a few of the problems with
                        respect to the Congress are solved.</p>
                    <p>The Minister: It has been a great pleasure for me to see you and I hope to
                        have an opportunity to see you again whenever you are in my country.</p>

                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> has written to
                        express to you his strong opposition to any abandonment of U.S. sovereignty
                        or jurisdiction over the Panama Canal (Tab B).<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2"
                            >Tab B is attached but not printed. The letter, dated April 3, reads:
                            “The principles endorsed in the resolution [<gloss target="#t_SR_1"
                                >SR</gloss> 301] are directly opposed to the Joint Statement of
                            Principles which was signed by Secretary of State <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> and Panamanian Foreign
                            Minister Juan <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> recently in
                            Panama City. Indeed, the resolution goes beyond the treaty situation,
                            and opposes any erosion of sovereignty through administrative action, or
                            legislation which evades the treaty process. Thus Senate Resolution 301
                            amounts to a massive vote of no-confidence in the present U.S.
                            negotiating posture with Panama, and indicates that a treaty based upon
                            the Joint Statement of Principles would lack the two-thirds majority
                            necessary for ratification.”</note> Specifically, he asks that we recede
                        from the joint Statement of Principles signed with Panama on February 7;
                        that we refrain from any transfer of property (such as Old France Airfield);
                        and that we endorse his concept of adding a third set of locks to expand the
                        present canal without negotiation of a new treaty. He notes that his
                        Resolution in the Senate calling for continued U.S. sovereignty and
                        jurisdiction in the Canal Zone was supported by 34 senators, <pb n="99"

                    <p>Since signature of the Principles in February, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has continued negotiations with the
                        Panamanians. These negotiations are still in their initial stages, however,
                        and though the Panamanians appear to be serious in their desire to make
                        progress, a treaty will take many months to complete. It is unlikely that it
                        would be ready for Congressional action before December.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his objections to a new treaty, the Senator expresses concern
                        over any erosion of sovereignty by legislative action—a reference to our
                        expressed intention to seek Congressional authority to transfer to Panama
                        two airfields in the Canal Zone which are no longer required by U.S.
                        military forces. Draft legislation providing for the transfer of Old France
                        and New France Airfields to Panama, which you approved in principle in
                        December, is now being prepared by OMB.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName>’s proposal to expand
                        the Canal by constructing a third, parallel but larger, set of locks is
                        strongly opposed by the Panamanians on its merits. Nor, based on our
                        analysis, does it appear necessary in order to handle anticipated traffic
                        over the next couple of decades. The Panamanians also insist that any
                        expansion of the Canal must be subject to their final agreement.</p>
                    <p>Attached at Tab A is a suggested response to Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> which stresses the similarity
                        between your objectives and his, reassures him regarding Congressional
                        participation on Canal matters, and offers to have me discuss the matter
                        with him. If you agree, I will meet with the Senator and other concerned
                        members in the interest of diffusing this opposition. As the talks progress,
                        both here and in Panama, we will review our position and keep you advised

                        we face is how best to achieve this objective. Our recent efforts have been
                        directed at reducing the hostile environment in which the Canal has been
                        operating, without at the same time impairing our ability to control and to
                        maintain the security of the Canal.</p>

                        sentiment in Panama make it obvious that without a basic minimum of consent
                        and cooperation, we cannot operate the Canal effectively over the long term.
                        We must also consider the Canal question in the context of our relations
                        with the other nations of the Caribbean and Latin America, who tend to view
                        this issue as indicating our basic attitudes towards dealing with them.</p>
                    <p>I fully recognize the importance of proceeding only with the cooperation and
                        support of the Congress in this matter. There is no intention of evading the
                        treaty process and I have given firm instructions that interested members of
                        the Senate be consulted regularly as negotiations proceed.</p>
                    <p>The matter of limited transfers of property, including Old and New France
                        Fields, remains under study within the Government. Any action proposed will
                        be submitted as legislation, subject to full Congressional consideration and
                        approval.</p>
                    <p>Your proposal for expansion of the Canal by construction of a third set of
                        locks provides a serious alternative among those available to us for
                        insuring adequate capacity in the future. There is some doubt, however, that
                        growth of Canal traffic is likely to require expansion of present facilities
                        for many years, and a great deal of study would be required before any
                        decision could be made among the several proposals.</p>

                        effect they asked: Is the Administration’s negotiation with Panama not a
                        sham, given a quantity of senatorial sentiment apparently sufficient to
                        defeat any treaty?</p>

                    <p>The Secretary deflected the ministerial aim during the meeting, then
                        deflected it further by a surprise, midnight appearance at a Panamanian
                        Embassy reception. At that reception the Secretary invited Minister

                    <p>“No, seriously—very good to see you. You were extremely good on Friday,<note

                    <p>“Will you have a drink?”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “To celebrate
                        my being away from Atlanta? Not a bad idea.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “You know, I hope <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> does not become confused with his Middle East and
                        Panama missions. With his Soviet colleague in Geneva he has instructions to
                        do absolutely nothing, and with you he has instructions to do absolutely
                        everything. And he travels so much that confusion could result.
                        (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>“And what are you drinking?”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “Ellsworth,
                        shall we have our Contadora drink?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “I believe that
                        would be fitting.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “Without the aphrodisiac, I hope. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>“Tell me, what are those characters really doing in Atlanta? No, before that:
                        I was wondering if the Ambassador [<persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> ] would like to rent his house. I need one,
                        and it was lovely.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez</persName>: “Perhaps you
                        could get it through the treaty negotiation.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “That would be too expensive and I couldn’t afford it. Of
                        course, I might sell some documents.</p>
                    <p>“Tell me, Mr. Minister, would you like to buy some documents? (Laughter) Just
                        enough to pay for my house, naturally.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “I wish to
                        reiterate my invitation to you to visit Contadora. There is a house there
                        for you. But only, of course, <pb n="103" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_103"/>when
                        you demolish the people opposing you and come down to sign a new treaty.”
                        (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “That’s going to happen.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “You asked
                        about what is going on in Atlanta. First may I say that I thought your
                        speech was very good. I especially liked your reference to the need for
                        precise definitions for reorganizing the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“I want to add that Panama is going to act positively regarding that entity.
                        But we have to face reality: the people in Latin America do not believe very
                        much in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, as it is. We think it is
                        in your interests and Panama’s to change it so that the Latins—and
                        yourselves—truly believe in it.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “Frankly, I think it would be better if we were to keep these
                        meetings of Foreign Ministers going. The only important work will be done in
                        them, not in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “I agree
                        absolutely. The informality of such meetings is what permits important work
                        to be done.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “You know, those <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                        procedures are so complicated! There are always people sitting behind me,
                        pushing pieces of paper at me and telling me when to do what. Finally, I
                        simply ignored them and broke protocolary rules, doing what I wished to do
                        to accomplish things.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “It was an
                        excellent idea to break through the protocolary wall. Perhaps you noticed
                        that I decided not to speak. I believe I was almost the only Minister who
                        did not.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “You know, when I
                        was in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> I had a system. I had an
                        officer sitting behind me, who had instructions to the effect that when my
                        head began to droop, he was to push against my chair and wake me up. It
                        worked.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “I may try that.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “Actually, we
                        all spend a great deal of time criticizing the long speeches made in the
                            <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, then it turns out that those who
                        are most critical are those who make the longest speeches.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “Take Chile. Over an hour!”</p>
                    <p>The Minister: “To be exact, an hour and a half.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “You know, it is very difficult to come to the end of a speech
                        on history, and I swear that man was bent on giving us every detail of the
                        whole history of Chile, including all the glorious details of the present
                        government.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “I myself had
                        a lot to overcome on that count—I was a history professor, and I could give
                        the longest speeches you can imagine!” (Laughter)</p>
                    <pb n="104" facs="0129" xml:id="pg_104"/>
                    <p>The Secretary: “You know, this sort of thing can be very discouraging. For
                        audiences, anyway. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>“I remember that at one point I was working for a President and we were
                        visiting Ireland. And an American-citizen Irishman who had delusions of
                        grandeur had us for what he called ‘dinner’. Well, there were three hours of
                        that dinner. But it did not end there: a musicale followed. Nor did it end
                        there: we were exposed to an historical pageant. When the pageant got up to
                        about the 17th century, I sneaked away and went to bed, about 3:30 in the
                        morning. But the President had, of course, to stay on—until 4:45 AM. You
                        know, he was so mad when he got away that he came and awakened me and yelled
                        at me for 15 solid minutes!” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “Speaking of
                        hours, Mr. Secretary, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> and I and our Deputies have just had a very valuable
                        one and one-half hour discussion of both the substance and the procedures

                    <p>The Secretary: “Let me say this. I ask my colleagues in the Department to
                        undertake something, and they tell me it will consume one month’s time. Now,
                        I do not believe that. In my experience, an undertaking is really completed
                        in about one day—there comes a time in every negotiation when you find
                        yourselves devoting just one day doing all the important work that is
                        needed. So, all you have to do is to schedule that one day when you are
                        going to complete this undertaking. (Laughter) No, seriously.</p>
                    <p>“Let me say this also. I think we may have arrived at a time when a
                        breakthrough is needed. The longer this negotiating lasts, the greater the
                        possibilities for the opposition in the Congress and elsewhere to
                        mobilize.</p>
                    <p>“Now, frankly, my own personal position would be better if I did not have to
                        be confronted with pressing this treaty through the mass of opposition. But,
                        if we can do it, let’s do it now . . . we all know what’s needed . . . let
                        us move forward.</p>
                    <p>“Besides, I can’t get anything done in the Middle East if I can’t get
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> out of this Panama thing!”
                        (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “Mr.
                        Secretary, ten years have passed, and a mountain of paper has accumulated.
                        But those years and that paper <pb n="105" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_105"/>have
                        not contributed, on either side, to a clear perception of, as you say, ‘What
                        is needed.’ We are at last getting that perception. I suppose you might
                        characterize it as a philosophical one, but with a practical aspect to it.
                        It is as simple as this: how do we integrate the two sets of interests:
                        Panama’s urge for sovereignty on one hand, and the United States’ urge for
                        protection of its vital interests on the other.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “That’s it precisely.</p>
                    <p>“You realize, of course, that we have trouble in yielding ‘sovereignty’,
                        because of the opposition. But if I can establish that we are getting in
                        return the practical things we need, then I think we might get over the
                        hurdle.</p>
                    <p>“One large piece of that hurdle is, of course, those people who live in the
                        Zone. I have little sympathy on that score. Still, they are there. I sense
                        that if we could get through a certain transitional period—if we could prove
                        over a period that the ‘Zonians’ could live well enough under your
                        sovereignty, then we would have the problem licked. Right, <persName
                            corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “About the people
                        in the Zone, I have talked with all their representatives, and what they are
                        worried about, of course, is their personal security. I have tried to give
                        them assurances that they will be protected, and shall keep doing so.”<note

                    <p>The Secretary: “I believe we can meld our practical necessities, and that we
                        can become partners in the Canal through this ‘integration’ process you
                        speak of. Perhaps, then I might be permitted onto Contadora Island to sign
                        the treaty.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “May I suggest
                        that one way of approaching this ‘integration’ problem is for the
                        negotiators to proceed, through a process of elimination, to pinpoint what
                        the U.S. needs and what it does not need to protect its interests in the
                        Canal. You, and many others, know that there are a number of United States
                        activities in the Zone which have no real bearing on the United States’ true
                        interests.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “For example?”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “For example,
                        uniformed American police giving private Panamanians traffic tickets.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “I agree absolutely. This sort of thing we can find practical
                        solutions for. That is ridiculous.</p>
                    <p>“What about the terminal date of the treaty? Is that a problem for the
                        breakthrough?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “Yes it is, and for
                        that reason the Minister and I have agreed to tackle that issue last.”</p>
                    <pb n="106" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_106"/>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “We must
                        address it at the last, for otherwise the negotiations would not move
                        forward at all. We would come to a dead stop on that.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “What schedule do the two of you have in mind?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “The Deputies are
                        now consolidating the major issues and . . .”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “I suppose the Deputies work on that island, too. (Laughter)
                        Would that I could get my negotiations located on an island resort.”
                        (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “And, we have an
                        understanding that we would not wish to present a treaty to the Congress
                        during this session.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “Absolutely, definitely not.”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “In fact, we have
                        seen the Vice President recently, and he has told us to go slowly for now,
                        but to expedite the treaty matter in 1975.”<note n="7" xml:id="d40fn7">See
                                <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “Is the Vice President supporting this?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “Yes.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “That is good. That will help. Then all you have to do is
                        convince the Secretary of State, and you have the thing made. (Laughter)
                        Perhaps it would be well to present the treaty in the first part of next
                        year’s sessions.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “I must say,
                        Mr. Secretary, that I am convinced that we can have something, a first
                        draft, by the end of the year.</p>
                    <p>“You know, some people think we are going very slowly, but they do not
                        understand how we are working, and I am certain we are doing it the right
                        way. I think we shall be going very strongly after May.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “The way I see it, we do not wish to provoke a tremendous
                        debate in the Congress and in the country for nothing. There are elections
                        coming up, and I rather think more liberals than conservatives will be
                        elected. So these elections will place your treaty in a much better
                        position.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “I understand
                        what you mean, and I certainly hope so.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “That is the kind that requires a two-thirds vote, right?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “Yes.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and I will be meeting
                        again in late May and . . .”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “On the island, I presume.” (Laughter)</p>
                    <pb n="107" facs="0132" xml:id="pg_107"/>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “Yes.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: (To Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>)
                        “A national disgrace! You know, I had so many applicants for the Middle East
                        job, and I picked <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. But he
                        didn’t really want it, and . . . <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName>, how many times have you been in the Middle East
                        and Panama?” (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “The work of
                        the Deputies is extremely important. Many people do not understand this, or
                        the way we are working generally, and perhaps it is best that they not
                        understand it.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “I agree. You have to take the necessary time, and you have to
                        maintain the good will you have both obviously developed. <persName
                            corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>, are you confident this is the
                        way to do it . . . are you content?”</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: “Decidedly.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “OK!”</p>
                    <p>“Pay no attention to this device attached to me. You know, they’re making a
                        television special on me, and wiring me for sound. I assure you I am not
                        taping this conversation. (Laughter)</p>
                    <p>“Seriously, I want you to know I am totally behind this reaching for
                        agreement. I want to reaffirm to you privately what I said the other day to
                        the Ministers. Moreover, do not be too concerned with the votes in the
                        Congress. What some members will do today, they would not do with a treaty
                        in front of them.”</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: “After what
                        you have said, and what we learned at breakfast the other day with the two
                        Senators, we believe the Senate is not the problem we had thought it to
                        be.</p>
                    <p>“Now, Mr. Secretary, I know your time is limited, and I believe you should
                        pass from one canal to another (laughter), so we shall take our leave.”</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: “Mr. Minister, anytime you are in Washington I would like to
                        see you. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>, will you see to

                        with Panama, emphasizing that Congressional reaction to the 1967 draft
                        treaties made it inexpedient for them to be submitted to the Senate, and
                        pointing out that the wording of the recently initialed principles portends
                        a treaty even more favorable to Panama than the 1967 versions.<note n="2"

                    <p>Dr. Lucier stated that the real problem for Congress is the degree of control
                        over the operations and defense of the Canal to be retained by the US. He
                        indicated that he understood the constraint under which the Department of
                        Defense operates, in view of the State Department blue-print for the new
                        treaty, comparing the Defense role to fighting a rear guard action.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Lucier focused upon the Statement of Principles which the Secretary of
                        State initialed in Panama City on 7 February, evincing a strongly
                        conservative point of view in attacking each of the eight principles on
                        grounds that they were wrong and based on false assumptions.<note n="3"

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Principle 4:</hi> The use of the term “Panamanian
                        territory” is an implied assumption. Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName> strongly believes that the Canal Zone is not
                        Panamanian territory; that the US has sovereign authority there; and that
                        Panama has residual authority, except that Colombia should have first claim
                        to the territory if we get out. This entire matter should be a negotiating
                        chip.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Principle 5:</hi> Who decides what constitutes a “just and
                        equitable share”?</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Principle 6:</hi> Panamanian citizens are now to be in
                        administrative positions. Under no circumstances should we have two
                        governments involved, and thus a split administration, which is
                        unworkable.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Principle 7:</hi> With Panamanian participation in the
                        defense of the Canal, again there is split responsibility which is worse in
                        the context of defense than in administration of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Principle 8:</hi> A sea level canal is absolutely
                        impractical. It would be too expensive, and a new treaty would not provide
                        sufficient U.S. control. The Sea Level Canal Study provided inadequate
                        treatment of the ecological hazards. We should modernize the current
                            canal.<note n="5" xml:id="d41fn5">See <ref target="frus1969-76ve10#d541"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Comments</p>
                    <p>Dr. Lucier feels that all eight principles are wrong and are based upon false
                        assumptions. Specifically:</p>
                    <p>—The State Department is misreading the strong opposition in Senate against a
                        treaty based upon these principles.</p>
                    <pb n="110" facs="0135" xml:id="pg_110"/>
                    <p>—More than the present 35 Senate signatories are expected to endorse the
                        recent <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> resolution in
                        support of continued, undiluted U.S. sovereignty and jurisdiction over the
                        U.S. owned Canal.</p>
                    <p>—Unless the State Department alters its present course and accepts the
                        realities of the climate in Congress, it will collide, head-on, with the
                        Senate. If this happens, the situation could become serious in Panama,
                        because of the present euphoric negotiating climate and subsequent
                        frustration if negotiations falter.</p>
                    <p>—The only viable alternative to a collision with the Senate is for the
                        Administration to support the expansion of the Canal capacity by the
                        TERMINAL LAKE—3RD LOCK PLAN which Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName> introduced in the Senate (Congressman <persName
                            corresp="#p_FDJ_1">Flood</persName> introduced a similar bill in the
                            House).<note n="6" xml:id="d41fn6">In 1973, <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                                >Thurmond</persName> introduced the “Panama Canal Modernization Act”
                            (S.2330), which discussed a Third Locks Project and was distinct from
                            the later Senate Resolution 301. The bill was referred to the Senate
                            Committee on Armed Services on August 2, 1973.</note> This proposal is
                        still the cheapest, most effective way to modernize the Canal without
                        requiring a change in the boundaries of the Canal Zone or a new treaty.</p>

                            April 29, 1974, pp. 453–457.</note></p>
                    <p>—The real U.S. interest is in continued operation and defense of the Canal by
                        the U.S.</p>
                    <p>—It is the manner of our presence in the Canal Zone which causes friction
                        rather than U.S. presence per se.</p>
                    <p>—Our ability to remain in the Canal Zone rests upon the consent of the
                        Panamanian people. We cannot negotiate our required presence unless the U.S.
                        has true sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>—If a new treaty is negotiated along the lines indicated by the principles,
                        the Canal operation will suffer from the instability of the Panamanian
                        Government. Rivalries for power will result in attempts to undermine the
                        Canal operation by anti-American agitation. There will be efforts, through
                        internal Panamanian Government discussions, to speed up the economic
                        benefits to Panama. The Canal will be prone to external attack by enemies of
                        the U.S. attempting to control the Canal; by subversive attempts within the
                        Government of Panama (GOP) to destroy the Canal operation; and by the
                        resultant U.S. reaction by force, which would demonstrate brutality on the
                        part of the U.S. as well as <pb n="111" facs="0136" xml:id="pg_111"
                        />ineptness on the part of the GOP. Additionally, the U.S. Government will
                        be under pressure to control the GOP, causing further unrest.</p>
                    <p>—In sum, the solution advocated by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> will cause significant instability.</p>

                        shared some of the misgivings over the principles enumerated by Dr. Lucier.
                        He emphasized, however, that we worked for the President, were responsive to
                        his directives, and within those parameters, should see what kind of a
                        mutually satisfactory treaty could be worked out.</p>

                        at point “A” on an “A” to “Z” spectrum. He stated that the other end would
                        describe the 1903 treaty and the current Canal Zone arrangements as
                        anachronistic. This viewpoint, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHLT_1"
                            >Koren</persName> observed, holds that some change in the
                        U.S.-Panamanian relationship is necessary, for circumstances could develop
                        whereby the Panamanians could make it impossible for us to run the
                        Canal.</p>

                    <p>—An alternative which would gain the concurrence of the Panamanians and
                        simultaneously receive Latin American approval would be a Third Locks

                    <p>PNA 384. Subj: GOP Closure of Canal Zone Customs and Immigration at Tocumen
                        Airport.</p>
                    <p>1. This is a preliminary report of action by the Government of Panama the
                        evening of May 21 to deny Canal Zone Customs and Immigration Officers access
                        to Tocumen International Airport in violation of Article XVII of the 1949
                        Aviation Agreement which provides for U.S. exercise of control, inspection
                        and processing of passengers, cargo and mail destined for the Canal
                        Zone.</p>
                    <p>2. About 2300 hours May 21 the Canal Zone Customs and Immigration Officer on
                        duty at Tocumen was asked to come to the VIP lounge at the airport because
                        Panamanian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>
                        wanted to talk with him. (<persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> had
                        just arrived from New York aboard Pan Am Flight 223.) Speaking rapidly in
                        Spanish, <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> was understood to have
                        said that the inspector was to leave the airport right away. When the
                        inspector expressed surprise and asked the reason <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> was under<pb n="113" facs="0138"
                            xml:id="pg_113"/>stood to have said something about courtesy and that he
                        should check with the US Embassy.</p>
                    <p>3. The Canal Zone inspector returned to his office in the Tocumen terminal
                        and reported the situation to his chiefs in the Customs Division. He was
                        instructed to speak with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> again.</p>
                    <p>4. The inspector then went to the VIP lounge, knocked on the door, and
                        entered. Excusing himself, the inspector asked <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> if what he had said previously applied only to him or
                        to all other Canal Zone inspectors. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> immediately answered, “All the inspectors.” During the
                        last ten minutes or so before departing the terminal, the inspector noted
                        several members of the National Guard observing whether he was leaving.</p>
                    <p>5. The Guardia Nacional security office at Tocumen Airport has confirmed that
                        they have been ordered not to permit Canal Zone Customs and Immigration
                        Officials to function at Tocumen. A <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss>
                        security official explained the order had been issued because Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> had been treated
                        discourteously by United States “customs officials.” Since midnight May 21
                        there has been no Canal Zone inspector at Tocumen.</p>
                    <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> has been
                        informed and will take the matter up with Foreign Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> immediately. Embassy has informed
                        Panama Desk and has asked State to track down basis for <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>’s charge that he was treated
                        discourteously by U.S. officials at any time during his trip to the United
                        States. It is believed that if any incident occurred it probably involved
                        airport security check at New York.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">In telegram
                            3017 from Panama City, May 25, the Embassy reported that <persName

                            authorities in New York forced him “to pass through metal detector three

                    <p>7. During period December 13–23, 1971, GOP usurped baggage inspection
                        function over passengers destined for Canal Zone in reaction to Congressman
                        Murphy’s charges of GOP laxity in narcotics control. At that time problem
                        was resolved through influence of local heads of Pan Am and Braniff after I
                        discussed possible necessity of requiring airlines to use <persName

                    <p rend="center">I. INTRODUCTION</p>
                    <p>In faithful reflection of the Contadora Island style of negotiation which the
                        distinguished chief negotiators have chosen, this briefing will be warm,
                        candid, informal, and rambling.</p>
                    <p>I have a lot of notes here for two reasons.</p>
                    <p>First, because I want to address myself specifically to a number of questions
                        that have been raised—and a number of fears that have been voiced.</p>
                    <p>Second, because we have now completed the first stage of the negotiation, and
                        are entering the second. Some refer to it as the “feature attraction.”
                        Perhaps it is rather more accurate to refer to it as the main bout. I would
                        like to set the stage for it carefully.</p>
                    <p>My remarks break down generally into three categories:</p>
                    <p>1. Comments on the last round of talks in Panama.</p>
                    <p>2. The philosophy and tactics underlying the future of the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>3. How this government should prepare itself for that negotiating future.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>The last round of talks in Panama.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">Deputy

                            report noted that the two sides had agreed on a “major-issues” paper
                            prepared by the Deputy Negotiators dated May 10.</note></p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">The telegraphic traffic presented the picture.</hi></p>
                    <p>—we completed the “preliminaries” with the agreement on the major issues that
                        flow from the Principles.</p>
                    <p>—these are a neutral statement of the issues.</p>
                    <p>—more importantly, they were arrived at jointly. The fact that they are a
                        joint product is encouraging because this has been helpful for <pb n="115"
                            facs="0140" xml:id="pg_115"/><persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName>. That leads me to comment on <persName
                            corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName>. He is a reflection of
                        General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, not <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>. That is, he is <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ man. That <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> would accept a product to which
                            <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> made a heavy
                        contribution is significant.</p>
                    <p>B. I would like to make two comments on this last round of talks.</p>
                    <p>First, Panama has continued to demonstrate a particular sort of approach to
                        the negotiations. I want to define this approach with some precision, lest
                        there be any erroneous impressions:</p>
                    <p>a. It is a <hi rend="italic">flexible</hi> approach—but not necessarily
                        concessional:</p>
                    <p>—they are willing to <hi rend="italic">debate</hi>, even change their
                        positions. For example, Panama has withdrawn its demand for inclusion of
                        civil and criminal jurisdiction as a major issue. We have not observed that
                        willingness to debate, to change, in quite a number of years.</p>
                    <p>b. It is an approach which reflects an increasing sense of practicality—a
                        sense of what will, and what will not, work in the real world.</p>
                    <p>—that is not to say that the Panamanians are off their sovereignty trip—they
                        will be on that forever.</p>
                    <p>—but, they are beginning to perceive that sovereignty will not be diluted in
                        unacceptable ways by agreeing to practical working arrangements with the
                        United States, on a transitional basis.</p>
                    <p>—An example of this practicality: the Panamanians have agreed to accord “use”
                        rights to the United States. This is an almost unprecedented action by the
                        Panamanians—one which the negotiators consider to be a major breakthrough.
                        It represents a practicality that we have not observed before.</p>
                    <p>c. It is an approach that hinges—I repeat, hinges—on the continuation of the
                        style of negotiation Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> has established: the <hi rend="italic"
                            >informality</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">plain talk</hi>, the <hi
                            rend="italic">friendliness</hi> which he has offered the
                        Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>—These things diminish the intensity of what I call the “<hi rend="italic"
                            >fright factor</hi>”—the fear the Panamanians have of our power . . . of
                        our expertise . . . and of our motivations. This fear has done great harm to
                        past negotiations.</p>
                    <p>—Any reversion to the more formal style of negotiation, whatever its merits,
                        could cause an intensification of the “fright factor” that could be a cause
                        for failure of the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>d. It is an approach which reflects, in my judgment, a firm decision on the
                        part of Panama to conclude a treaty as promptly as possible.</p>
                    <p>—We have not observed this determination to conclude a treaty on the part of
                        the Panamanians in the recent past.</p>
                    <p>—I sense it is because <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        wants a treaty—and that it doesn’t have to be a 100% Panamanian treaty.</p>
                    <pb n="116" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_116"/>
                    <p>e. In sum, it is an approach with which the United States can work. It is an
                        approach which we can exploit, and are doing so.</p>
                    <p>But it takes an effort on our part to respond as the Panamanians come along;
                        we must persistently tailor our own approach to their approach.</p>
                    <p>Let me illustrate how the Panamanians are coming along. I raised with
                            <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> the question of
                        a Panamanian concession to show Panama’s good faith in the negotiations.
                        Until now, I said, all Panama had done to show its good faith was maintain a
                        good climate for the talks. I thought that now would be a good time for
                        Panama to go beyond this. I suggested some ideas on what I thought would be
                        reasonable concessions. A short time later I received a message from
                        Gonzalez that Panama would recede from its demand for control over schools
                        and hospitals in the Zone while U.S. citizens were still there. Panama
                        regards this as a major concession.</p>
                    <p>My second comment on the last round of negotiations concerns the problems and
                        awkwardness for the United States of negotiating in Panama, on an isolated
                        island, many miles away from Washington.</p>
                    <p>—I am afraid that is an awkwardness that we must bear:</p>
                    <quote><p>—Washington must bear the negotiators’ seemingly unreasonable and
                            intemperate demands for prompt comments on positions.</p>
                        <p>—The negotiators must bear Washington’s seeming sluggishness in
                            responding.</p></quote>
                    <p>—But the U.S. can bear this inconvenience. Panama, limited in its negotiating
                        skills, still frightened, gun-shy, cannot.</p>
                    <p>One point here, at the risk of seeming to indulge in the traditional whine of
                        negotiators:</p>
                    <p>—there has to be a recognition that</p>
                    <p>a. the negotiators are in fact <hi rend="italic">negotiating.</hi> As the
                        Secretary said during his October 5 meeting with the Foreign Minister in New
                        York, “We cannot impose our will, and neither can you extort from us.”<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">See <ref target="#d21">Document 21</ref>.</note>
                        The negotiators will not impose the U.S. will on Panama. We are bargaining,
                        and we will try to obtain the maximum, but we will not get <hi rend="italic"
                            >everything</hi> we want.</p>
                    <p>b. There will be times when we cannot accept suggestions we receive from
                        Washington. On these occasions, please remember that we are not <hi
                            rend="italic">always</hi> wrong. For example, in the last round, there
                        was one suggestion regarding one issue, which, if we had accepted it, would
                        have had serious implications for our position in another issue.</p>
                    <pb n="117" facs="0142" xml:id="pg_117"/>
                    <p>c. We will make errors, or I should say, I’ll make errors. (The Chief
                        Negotiator does not make errors.) But we will count on Washington’s <hi
                            rend="italic">help</hi> when we do so.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III.</p>
                    <p>I would now like to turn to my second major topic, the philosophy and
                        strategy underlying the negotiating future. There are a number of points to
                        be made:</p>
                    <p>A. First, with respect to guidance.</p>
                    <p>The negotiators are operating solely on the basis of two pieces of
                        outstanding guidance:</p>
                    <p>1. The presidential instructions contained in the <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                            >NSDM</gloss>’s,<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4">See <ref target="#d18fn5"
                                >footnote 5, Document 18</ref>. Additionally, on June 10, 1974,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> issued <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 257, which mandated “giving close
                            attention to negotiations with Panama, continuing them in the spirit
                            characterized by the negotiation of the Statement of Principles signed
                            on February 7.” (National Archives, Nixon Presidential Materials, <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Files, <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss> Institutional Files (H-Files), Box H–248, National
                            Security Decision Memoranda, NDSM 257)</note> and</p>
                    <p>2. The agreement on “Principles.”</p>
                    <p>—There is no furtive guidance from the Secretary or the President.</p>
                    <p>—There are no furtive covenants with the Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>If anything is new, it is that the Secretary has made clear that he and the
                        President want an <hi rend="italic">equitable treaty</hi>—and <hi
                            rend="italic">promptly.</hi></p>
                    <p>If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> ever considers
                        that a change in guidance is necessary, he will recommend it in the
                        established channels. Then the interested agencies will fight it
                        out—openly—and the President will decide.</p>
                    <p>B. Second, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> intends
                        to adopt a particular approach to the negotiations:</p>
                    <p>1. It will be “careful, methodical, but with all deliberate speed.”</p>
                    <p>2. We will proceed from the general to the particular, carving out areas of
                        conceptual agreement. We will move layer by layer, carefully. This is
                        necessary because:</p>
                    <p>a. it educates the negotiators on both sides,</p>
                    <p>b. it reduces Panama’s fright factor, and</p>
                    <p>c. it draws Panama into a net of agreements.</p>
                    <p>C. Third, with respect to congressional opposition:</p>
                    <p>In Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s view, we:</p>
                    <p>—cannot negotiate with the fear of a defeat in mind, but</p>
                    <p>—We have to be persistently attentive to the opposition.</p>
                    <pb n="118" facs="0143" xml:id="pg_118"/>
                    <p>—As far as possible, we want to build up support for our position on both the
                        public and private level.</p>
                    <p>—We want to do this in a low key now. We want to avoid premature battle now
                        and save our campaign for selective use when we have a treaty in sight.</p>
                    <p>—In this regard, we have done some analysis concerning the <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> resolution.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d43fn5">See <ref target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note> Of the
                        34 sponsors, some will be retiring, some can be otherwise persuaded, and
                        some are up for reelection. We believe that there is a hard-core of about 16
                        or 17.</p>
                    <p>D. My fourth point has to do with timing.</p>
                    <p>The response: who knows when we’ll have a treaty?! The GOP would not be
                        unhappy with a first draft by the end of the year. Neither would the U.S.
                        negotiators. A lot depends upon the reactions of the Panamanians. It also
                        depends on progress we make in the talks and also on getting Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> out of the grasp of the
                        Secretary. Certainly it is in the realm of possibility. We are also mindful
                        of the Vice President’s advice that a treaty should be presented for
                        ratification in the first half of 1975.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                    <p>I would now like to turn to my last topic: how the U.S. should prepare for
                        the negotiating future.</p>
                    <p>A. We think that the idea of a staff support group, made up primarily by
                        members from State and Defense, would be useful. Our idea is that the group
                        would be a “think tank” for the negotiators. It would bring together
                        individuals who are closely involved with the negotiations to analyze
                        identified problems, present creative alternatives, and prepare working
                        documents as needed. The members would be independent of their agencies, but
                        would refer the results back to their agencies.</p>
                    <p>The basic group will consist of 4 representatives each from State and
                        Defense, and I will serve as chairman. In my absence there will be an
                        administrative chairman representing the negotiators. Individuals with
                        expertise on particular issues would be invited to work with the group from
                        time to time. While the group will not make policy decisions, it will be
                        expected to speed the eventual coordination process by indicating to the
                        negotiators the possible reaction of the bureaus and agencies from which its
                        members are drawn. The first meeting will be tomorrow, May 29, at 3 p.m. in
                        our new conference room.<note n="6" xml:id="d43fn6">The account of what
                            might be the May 29 Staff Support Group meeting is in the National

                    <p>B. One of the first orders of business for the group will be to analyze the
                        range of U.S. positions on each issue in order to assist the negotiators in
                        deciding on the first issue for substantive negotiations.</p>
                    <p>We need to arrange the issues in a sequence which affords the highest
                        probability of initial agreement.</p>
                    <p>Panama has already suggested jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>We might want to start with a consideration of U.S. rights.</p>
                    <p>Defense has suggested that we begin with an examination of Panamanian
                        participation in administration.</p>
                    <p>We should keep in mind, though, that we might want to start with another
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>The staff support group should consider that question promptly. I would hope
                        that there would be a decision before mid-June for use during a possible
                        trip by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> at the end
                        of the month.<note n="7" xml:id="d43fn7"><persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                        expect that the group will meet daily.</p>
                    <p rend="center">V. CONCLUSION</p>
                    <p>Someone has asked me what sensations I have respecting the chances that we
                        can conclude a mutually satisfactory treaty with Panama. I have some
                        hesitancy in speaking of those sensations because in such cases one’s words
                        almost inevitably tend to turn out to be famous last ones.</p>
                    <p>But, having said that, let me say that, looking at the past, one has to be
                        pessimistic. Looking at the present, one has to be optimistic. The present
                        negotiators are trying to strike a fine balance—and I hope that they have.
                        We realize that it requires hard work, but we can’t be negative. Thus, I
                        believe that a satisfactory treaty is definitely possible—and possibly
                        sooner rather than later.</p>
                    <p>I attribute this sensation to the application of <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> ian skills and charms to what is, for the
                        Ambassador-at-Large, only the most recent in a long string of bouts gauged
                        as being impossible to win.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador recently celebrated his 80th birthday. I ask you to join me in
                        a birthday salutation, in absentia, for health and a long life.</p>
                    <p>I’ll take questions now.</p>

                        to reach agreement with us on a treaty? What’s in it for Panama now?</p>
                    <p>Answer: <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has apparently made
                        up his mind that now is a propitious time for Panama to accept a treaty with
                        the United States. We must remember that his is a simplistic mind—I believe
                        he feels <pb n="120" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_120"/>that at the present time
                        Panama will be able to get as much as it ever will from a new treaty.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LS_2">Steve Low</persName> (<gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss>): Considering your comments on Panama’s willingness to
                        maintain a good negotiating climate, how do you interpret Panama’s
                        initiatives in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the
                        Universal Postal Union (UPU)? (Note: Panama has raised in international
                        meetings of these organizations the question of Panamanian sovereignty in
                        the Canal Zone.)</p>
                    <p>Answer: The United States and Panama have a sort of gentlemen’s agreement for
                        the duration of the negotiations. We recognize that Panama needs to maintain
                        the international support it has on the Canal issue and that it will seize
                        any chance it has to publicize its position. We have told the Panamanians
                        that we understand their need to do this. But we have warned them not to
                        press these issues, except in those cases where it doesn’t hurt the United
                        States from a substantive point of view. I have told <persName
                            corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> not to press these types
                        of things to a vote. Panama must not be overly provocative.</p>
                    <p>Question: Then Panama won’t push the ITU and UPU issues to a vote?</p>
                    <p>Answer: We don’t know yet for sure.</p>
                    <p>Col. T. Swett (<gloss target="#t_DODISA_1">DOD/ISA</gloss>): Do the issues
                        that have been discussed recently in the PRC also fall within this
                        “gentlemen’s agreement?”</p>
                    <p>Answer: Yes. In this regard, I think that the mini-PRC is a good sign. At
                        least I sense this in the squatter area. However, it is the kind of thing we
                        will have to learn to live with. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> realizes that some of this can be counter-productive
                        with the Congress. His last trip here opened his eyes to this.</p>

                        Government doesn’t always act in a rational, coordinated manner, and yet we
                        assume that other Governments do. Couldn’t this be the case with Panama?</p>
                    <p>Answer: Well, we must admit that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>’ own left hand doesn’t know what his right hand is
                        doing. The Panamanian Government certainly doesn’t display close
                        coordination.</p>
                    <p>Question: I think we should take this factor into account when faced with
                        these apparent harassing actions.</p>
                    <p>Answer: I hope we can.</p>

                            target="#t_ARAPAF_1">ARA/PAF</gloss>): I still have questions about why
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> feels at this time
                        that it pays to settle with us.</p>
                    <p>Answer: To really know the answer requires getting into <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ mind. Perhaps it is because he
                        feels so secure in his domestic position. I also have the feeling that he is
                        bored with government and will want to turn over the reins. However, he
                        wants a treaty during his tenure, so he is <pb n="121" facs="0146"
                            xml:id="pg_121"/>willing to get what he can now. I also sense that he’s
                        bored with the negotiation. It is too massive, too complex for him to
                        grasp.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_HRB_1">Dick Howard</persName> (<gloss
                            target="#t_ARAPAN_1">ARA/PAN</gloss>): Don’t you also think that the

                        raised <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ expectations that

                    <p>Answer: I think that that may have been a factor. Perhaps because Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s appointment reduced what
                        I earlier called the “fright factor”, the Panamanians are less reluctant to
                        reach an agreement. I must say that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> was terribly impressed by Ambassador <persName

                    <p>Answer: <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> have made a decision to negotiate
                        politically. All other advisors have been isolated. The hardliners are
                        without a power base; they do not have sufficient popular appeal.</p>

                            target="#t_ODUSA_1">ODUSA</gloss>): Could you be more precise about the
                        next phase of the negotiations? What do you expect will come out of the next
                        round?</p>
                    <p>Answer: One thing we will want to do is see how our positions fit into the
                        framework of the 8 principles. As I view it we must arrive at “threshold
                        agreements”. By this I mean general statements of how the negotiators will
                        want resolution of the issues to go. These will be used by the treaty
                        drafters in writing the actual treaty language. The threshold agreements
                        won’t be the actual language itself.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJH_1">Jeff Smith</persName> (<gloss
                            target="#t_DODJAG_1">DOD/JAG</gloss>): Given the complexity of the
                        issues, can we have a simple treaty by the year’s end and would we want to
                        table before the Congress a simple treaty without annexes?</p>
                    <p>Answer: In previous negotiating phases, the United States has always
                        expressed its desire for a simple treaty and the Panamanians have wanted all
                        the details written in. Now when the Panamanians say that they want a simple
                        treaty, the doubts about the wisdom of this come from elements of this
                        government. I believe that there will have to be some annexes. The Foreign
                        Minister has said that there should be some, but he also said that they too
                        should be simple. I think that the Panamanians have moved to the idea of a
                        simple treaty because for the first time in the negotiating history they
                        believe that they will have participation in Canal activities.</p>

                            target="#t_DODISA_1">DOD/ ISA</gloss>): In this regard I just want to
                        warn that we proceed with caution. If we have a simple treaty, then we
                        should have as many of the differences between us as possible written down
                        on paper.</p>
                    <p>Answer: As I indicated to you at lunch, George, our approach will have to be
                        geopolitical. If we confront the evils now, it means we will <pb n="122"
                            facs="0147" xml:id="pg_122"/>not get a treaty. It may be hard for us if
                        we postpone meeting the evils until later, but it gives us a chance to get a
                        treaty.</p>

                        treaty?</p>
                    <p>Answer: We have to be careful how we approach this, since we could scare the
                        Panamanians off. I think we can get a simple treaty with a number of
                        annexes. If we make a contribution in the matter of providing Panamanian
                        participation in administration, the Panamanians will be more accommodating,
                        mainly in permitting us what we need for operations. I don’t think that
                        defense rights will be a major hurdle, provided we find the right
                        trappings.</p>

                        Discussions</p>
                    <p>In accordance with your request, we have considered the relative merits of
                        beginning substantive talks with (a) the issue of jurisdiction, (b)
                        questions concerning jurisdiction and United States “use” rights combined,
                        or (c) the matter of Panamanian participation in the administration of the
                        Canal by the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="123" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_123"/>
                    <p>We have concluded that participation should be the first topic for
                        substantive discussion. The following factors are fundamental of this
                        conclusion:</p>
                    <p>1. The primary objective in selecting a topic for the first substantive talks
                        on major treaty issues is to discuss a subject area which will be mutually
                        productive and conducive to enhancement of negotiations.</p>
                    <p>2. The first round of substantive talks will be exploratory in nature, and
                        will therefore concern basic concepts rather than specific formulae.</p>
                    <p>3. The possible U.S. positions concerning Panamanian participation reflected
                        in the attached paper will be approved by the U.S. negotiators after
                        consultation with the interested agencies and bureaus within the U.S.
                            Government.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2">In the lower right-hand margin,
                            an unknown hand wrote: “No Group.”</note></p>
                    <p>4. The established style of negotiation does not require that all major
                        issues identified under a particular principle be addressed together, but
                        rather will permit issues to be addressed in the order most convenient to
                        the negotiators. In this regard, it is assumed that the negotiators will not
                        necessarily exhaust a particular issue (i.e., reach a “threshold agreement”)
                        before moving to another, but may discuss a number of issues at the
                        conceptual level before entering into more detailed discussion of any one of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The advantages and disadvantages of the options presented, as we view them,
                        are as follows:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option 1: <hi rend="roman">The question of all
                            aspects relative to jurisdiction.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                    <p>1. Might be possible to separate out for independent discussion any one of
                        the five basic categories of jurisdiction involved (i.e., criminal, civil,
                        police, private enterprise and legal rights of US agencies), thus narrowing
                        the scope of discussion to a manageable level.</p>
                    <p>2. Might permit the U.S. to demonstrate an accommodating attitude at the
                        outset of substantive talks on an issue of overriding importance to Panama
                        and might encourage Panama to reciprocate on other issues of importance to
                        the U.S.</p>
                    <p>3. Would constitute a positive response to Panama’s initial statement of
                        preference for this as the first substantive issue to be addressed.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                    <p>1. Would require the expenditure of significant U.S. concessions, without
                        providing us the opportunity to seek substantive Panamanian concessions in
                        return.</p>
                    <pb n="124" facs="0149" xml:id="pg_124"/>
                    <p>2. Would risk the possibility of reaching an impasse at the outset. Might be
                        faced with previous Panamanian hardline, inflexible positions and therefore
                        the choice of leaving the issue unresolved in principle (and hanging heavily
                        over discussions of other issues) or of making unacceptable concessions.</p>
                    <p>3. Is a very complex issue and has not been recently reviewed. These issues
                        could be discussed in only the most general and vague way.</p>
                    <p>4. Even if we attempt to separate out basic categories, Panama may force us
                        into a discussion of other issues such as lands and facilities.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option 2: <hi rend="roman">Same as Option 1, but
                            expand scope of discussion to include the question of the “use” rights
                            which Panama will confer upon the United States to enable it to carry
                            out the functions provided for in Principle 6.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                    <p>1. Would permit a balanced discussion of possible trade-offs between matters
                        of importance to each party.</p>
                    <p>2. Fairly positive response to Panama’s proposal.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                    <p>1. Probably impossible to prepare for in short time frame available (i.e.,
                        with respect to some complex categories of U.S. rights, notably defense, the
                        process of identifying our objectives within the U.S. Government may not be
                        completed for some time. Thus, we would have to limit the discussion of U.S.
                        rights with the attendant problem of reducing the range of Panamanian
                        concessions which we could seek in return for U.S. concessions). In any
                        event, would be a much more complex subject for discussion than either
                        Option 1 or 3.</p>
                    <p>2. Possibility of reaching impasse on jurisdiction (see Disadvantages 2–4
                        under Option 1) with additional disadvantage of drawing U.S. rights into
                        such a situation.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Option 3: <hi rend="roman">The questions of what form

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advantages</p>
                    <p>1. Would exploit recent Panamanian expressions of willingness to discuss this
                        option.</p>
                    <p>2. Would permit the U.S. to retain the negotiating initiative.</p>
                    <p>3. Would probably not require such extensive U.S. accommodations as would the
                        issue of jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>4. Absence of previous fixed Panamanian positions on issue might prompt a
                        flexible approach by Panama.</p>
                    <pb n="125" facs="0150" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                    <p>5. Could pave the way for a more accommodating Panamanian approach to the
                        issue of U.S. rights based upon understandings reached concerning the form
                        and degree of Panamanian participation in the administration of the
                        Canal.</p>
                    <p>6. Would serve to draw out Panamanian views on major Canal administration and
                        participation issues which are essential to developing a comprehensive U.S.
                        position.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Disadvantages</p>
                    <p>1. Could risk an impasse due to the lack of information about Panama’s views
                        on this issue.</p>
                    <p>2. Might pose difficulty for Panama in discussing this issue in depth.</p>

                            maintain the canal and auxiliary works. There was to be a Panamanian
                            liaison officer to the U.S. instrumentality and there were general
                            consultation provisions.</p>

                        <p>The 1967 treaty drafts established an “international judicial entity”,
                            the “joint administration”, which was to operate the canal and
                            administer the Canal Area. It was to be managed by a board composed of
                            five members from the United States and four from Panama. It had general
                            corporate powers and the extraordinary power to adopt a code governing
                            civil and criminal matters pertaining to the canal.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Nature of the
                            Problem</p>
                        <p>A. The problem is to guarantee effective U.S. control over canal
                            operations while incorporating Panamanians into the administration of
                            the canal.</p>
                        <p>B. There are two levels of the problem we must consider. First is the
                            degree of control which the United States must maintain in the overall
                            policy of canal operations. Second is the extent of Panamanian
                            participation in the day to day management and operation of the canal.
                            In pursuing current guidance to retain US control, we are not certain
                            what Panama desires when it says that it wishes to participate in canal
                            administration. However it is reasonable that Panama will wish to
                            participate at both levels. In the past Panama has been primarily
                            concerned with having the maximum number of Panamanians employed at all
                            levels of the canal administration. From discussions between the Deputy
                            Negotiators it is no longer clear that such a quantitative goal remains
                            paramount. Rather, Panama now appears primarily interested in
                            “meaningful” participation involving selected functions and
                            progressively more responsible positions without disturbing effective US
                            control agreed to in the Statement of Principles.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">III.</hi> Form of the Canal
                            Administration</p>
                        <p>The form of the canal administration is largely a technical matter and is
                            perhaps better considered after we know Panama’s concerns. <pb n="127"
                                facs="0152" xml:id="pg_127"/>Nevertheless if Panama desires to
                            discuss this matter, we are prepared to begin discussions noting that
                            there are several possible forms which could accomplish United States’
                            purposes. Each of these forms is sufficiently flexible to permit
                            Panamanian participation yet preserving essential control in the United
                            States. They are:</p>
                        <p>(a) continuation of present Panama Canal Company</p>
                        <p>(b) creation of new United States Government corporation</p>
                        <p>(c) transfer of canal to a civil works function of the United States Army
                            Corps of Engineers</p>
                        <p>(d) creation of joint United States-Panamanian government corporation,
                            with control resting in United States.</p>
                        <p>The primary purpose of this entity would be to operate and maintain the
                            canal. However in creating the entity we should be careful to provide in
                            some way for administering those activities beyond mere operation and
                            maintenance of the canal (e.g. fire protection, housing, legal systems,
                            etc.), whether by the canal entity or a separate United States agency.
                            In this regard, prior Panamanian agreement is needed to confer such
                            activities on the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">IV.</hi> Panamanian
                            Participation</p>
                        <p>At the policy level, the GOP might seek representation in the entity
                            which will operate and maintain the canal. The U.S. might agree to have
                            Panamanians appointed to the Board of Directors, while maintaining a US
                            majority which ensures US control of the canal’s operation. The U.S.
                            might also consider other means to allow Panamanian participation in the
                            canal entity—such as allowing Panama to become a minority
                            shareholder.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we presume Panama will seek to have more of its citizens
                            employed in all functions and at all levels of canal administration.
                            Agreement on this form of participation requires considerable Panamanian
                            understanding of the complexities and restraints which are inherent in
                            this matter and which involve U.S. citizen employees, their civil
                            service status and labor unions. For our part, it may be necessary to
                            give preference to Panamanians for certain jobs. It will probably be
                            necessary to modify previous practices regarding security positions. In
                            this regard one feasible and attractive response might be to use the GOP
                            state employment agency as the primary labor source. This difficult
                            issue may need to be referred to a joint US-Panamanian committee.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">V.</hi> Consultations and
                            Concept of Growing Panamanian Participation over Time</p>
                        <p>These two issues are very closely related. The mutual goal of the new
                            concept of growing Panamanian participation is to insure that Panama is
                            capable of assuming complete canal operation upon termina<pb n="128"
                                facs="0153" xml:id="pg_128"/>tion of the new treaty. In keeping with
                            a concept of responsible partnership both parties should be able to
                            reach agreement that the need for growing Panamanian participation is a
                            matter of good management.</p>
                        <p>Although we do not believe it is practical or desirable to reach
                            agreement at this point on fixed quotas and timetables, we are prepared
                            to accept the concept of gradually increasing participation. Perhaps the
                            best approach is to schedule periodic consultations to insure that
                            progress is being made toward the goal of full and meaningful
                            participation by Panamanian nationals. Guided by a clear statement of
                            intent, these consultations could also consider questions of training
                            programs, employment practices, promotion and general personnel
                            policies. There are many forms which the consultations could take. They
                            could be the responsibility of the legal entity which operates the canal
                            or carried out separately through any number of possible formats.
                            Through consultation at the policy level, it might be useful and
                            desirable to create some type of personnel system at the administrative
                            level which could contribute to the smooth and gradual integration of
                            qualified Panamanian nationals into the process of operating the
                            canal.</p>

                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> referred to Panama’s
                        unstable political record and minimized the importance of Panamanian
                        nationalist pressures in favor of Panamanian sovereignty. He observed that
                        General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> was attempting to
                        create political interest in a problem which lacked wide support in Panama.
                        On the other hand he observed that he receives frequent expressions of
                        concern from the Canal Zone over the direction which negotiations appear to
                        be taking.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> suggested the
                        desirability of finding an alternative to the sovereignty solution embodied
                        in current negotiations. He said that he would discuss several such
                        proposals during the June 23 NBC T.V. program which will look at the canal
                        question, and identified “home-rule” as one of these alternatives. He
                        promised to list them for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> by letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">Not
                            found.</note></p>
                    <p>In concluding the meeting Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName> referred to his role in helping to gain the
                        election of the Administration. He commented that although he wishes to see
                        it remain in office “it will lose if it submits a draft treaty as envisioned
                        by the Joint Statement of Principles.”</p>
                    <p>In departing, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        reaffirmed his intent to keep Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName> informed. The meeting adjourned at 2:20 p.m.</p>

                    <p>2. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted recent Presidential guidance
                        contained in reference 1b related to Latin America, the signing of the Eight
                        Negotiating Principles, and the continuing progress of US-Panama treaty
                        negotiations. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it timely to review and
                        provide an updated position on treaty negotiation issues that impact on US
                        national security.</p>
                    <p>3. (C) The strategic importance of the canal to the United States has been a
                        consistent position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The ultimate security
                        objectives of the United States in Panama center on an efficiently operated
                        interoceanic waterway freely accessible to US vessels and one which would be
                        denied to US enemies in time of war. The current treaty has served those
                        purposes for 70 years. However, Latin American nationalism and worldwide
                        trends of the post-World War II period have fundamentally altered the means
                        by which the United States can continue to achieve those objectives at
                        reasonable cost. Collective security offers a viable long-term regional path
                        for insuring concerted hemispheric resistance to military incursions by US
                        enemies, to include overt military threats to Panama. Successful
                        negotiations with Panama may be a key element in insuring the continued
                        participation in collective security by the other Latin American states. A
                        new and mutually acceptable treaty will better serve the immediate US
                        security situation in Panama, as well as US security interests throughout
                        the hemisphere.</p>
                    <pb n="131" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_131"/>
                    <p>4. (S) It is imperative to identify clearly for the US negotiators that
                        national security interests indefinitely require the right of US vessels to
                        use the canal. This end requires effective US control of canal defense for
                        the longest possible term and explicit guarantees of use thereafter.
                        Presidential guidance as expressed in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>
                        131 calls for a treaty duration of 50 years as a negotiating objective,
                        during which full essential US rights will be retained.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d46fn4">See <ref target="#d18fn5">footnote 5, Document
                            18</ref>.</note> The concept of expansion of canal capacity, recognized
                        in the Eighth Negotiating Principle, offers additional opportunities for
                        negotiating extended US rights dating from the election of an expansion
                        option by the United States.</p>
                    <p>5. (S) The negotiating principles acknowledge the transfer of Panama Canal
                        Zone jurisdiction and sovereignty to the Government of Panama. Such a
                        transfer would not jeopardize US security interests as long as the new
                        treaty confers on the United States those rights necessary for the continued
                        operation, maintenance, protection, and defense of the Panama Canal and the
                        transit of ships.</p>
                    <p>6. (S) In view of the broad security and politico-military implications of
                        the Panama Canal treaty negotiations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff support the
                        current negotiating objective of reaching agreement on a new and mutually
                        acceptable treaty. Further, the Joint Chiefs of Staff affirm the position
                        that the US negotiators should:</p>
                    <p>a. Seek the longest possible lock canal treaty duration.</p>
                    <p>b. Seek the longest possible term for the exercise by the United States of
                        canal expansion options.</p>
                    <p>c. Seek the longest and broadest extension of US control over operations and
                        defense following any expansion.</p>
                    <p>d. Require a joint US-Panamanian guarantee that upon termination of the new
                        treaty provisions will exist to insure that the canal will be open to all
                        world shipping without discrimination, at reasonable tolls, and that Panama
                        would take no action that would hamper the efficient operation of the
                        waterway.</p>

                        U.S.-Panama Treaty Negotiations: Chief Negotiator Talks, Contadora Island,
                        June 26–30, 1974.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I. Summary</p>
                    <p>I have reached agreement with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> on the first of the substantive issues to be taken up:
                        Panama’s participation in the administration of the Canal. We are to form an
                        operating partnership in which the United States retains control over the
                        lifetime of the new treaty.</p>
                    <p>We plan two meetings during July between the chief negotiators and virtually
                        continuous sessions of our deputies, and that should move us fairly far
                        along the substantive negotiating road.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>For some months we have been preoccupied with creating the correct climate
                        for this negotiation. A posture of confrontation had to be converted into
                        one of accommodation; the general principles agreed upon; the specific
                        points at issue between the parties identified. Now we are proceeding into
                        substance.</p>
                    <p>The Panamanians had wished to take up first the issue of arrangements for
                        Panama’s acquisition of jurisdiction over the Canal Zone (read
                        “sovereignty”). But I preferred not to treat at the outset a matter which is
                        of overriding importance to Panama and on which I have wide negotiating
                        flexibility under the Presidential guidance. Hence I suggested the issue of
                        Panama’s participation in the administration of the waterway (no. 6. of the
                        eight “principles”), and they agree.</p>
                    <p>We proposed a set of concepts—the product of a joint State/Defense/Canal
                        Company effort—under which the United States would retain effective control
                        of Canal administration over the new treaty’s lifetime, yet which would
                        permit Panama to begin participating in the administration immediately the
                        treaty enters into force. That participation would increase during the
                        treaty period so that Panama would be able to assume total control at its
                        expiration.</p>
                    <pb n="133" facs="0158" xml:id="pg_133"/>
                    <p>Panamanians would be brought into and rise through the Panama Canal
                        enterprise at all levels and in all functions, although in a staged fashion
                        to allow for (a) psychological accommodations on both sides to what will be
                        a markedly new way of life, (b) the necessary training of Panamanians, and
                        (c) continual reassessment by the United States of whether its effective
                        control is in any significant measure being vitiated by Panama’s increasing
                        participation.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister’s initial response was gratifying. He said he recognized
                        that the United States had made a generous offer and that it was an
                        extremely pragmatic one.</p>
                    <p>He emphasized two points. First, Panamanian participation in Canal
                        administration “must begin in a modest way, and grow gradually.” “That is
                        the only sensible course.”</p>
                    <p>Second, “General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and the
                        Panamanian people fully accept that as a function of the United States’s
                        super-power status, it must control the Canal’s operation effectively.”</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> added that our offer of an
                        operating partnership in the Panama Canal enterprise constituted proof for
                        him that the United States was intent—as you had promised him it would be—on
                        negotiating with Panama as an equal, and on negotiating a truly equitable
                        treaty. Perhaps the most meaningful response he could make, he continued,
                        was to declare that the United States no longer had to fear encountering
                        “non-negotiable” Panamanian positions.</p>
                    <p>After explaining the set of United States concepts to <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> in some detail, and drawing on his
                        reactions to them, we reduced them to a two-page “threshold agreement.” That
                        is a document, to be employed throughout the negotiation, which sets forth
                        conceptual formulae for resolving treaty issues and which, when approved by
                        the chief negotiators, stands as firm guidance for the drafting of actual
                        treaty language.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister approved the text, following consultation on it with
                        General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. Thus we have
                        disposed of the first of the major issues between us.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III.</p>
                    <p>We plan to meet again in mid-July, and then at the month’s end, to address
                        Panama’s participation in the protection and defense of the Panama Canal.
                        That will be followed by the issue of Panama’s acquisition of jurisdiction
                        plus the operating rights the United States will retain. The deputies will
                        be in virtually constant session. Thereafter we plan a recess for the month
                        of August, and on resuming we would have only the issues of compensation to
                        Panama and of land areas to take up before we reach the final, critical
                        issues of the new treaty’s <pb n="134" facs="0159" xml:id="pg_134"/>duration
                        and of an option for the United States to expand Canal capacity. <note n="2"

                            3750 from Panama was inadvertently not transmitted. He reported that
                            U.S. and Panamanian officials had also reached a threshold agreement on
                            the abrogation of the 1903 treaty, and that the deputy negotiators had
                            been requested to remain in Panama for “two more days while he
                                [<persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> ] obtains the formal

                            counteroffer for Principle VI on July 15. The memorandum quoted Bell as
                            saying the counterproposal was “generally acceptable” and “in the ball
                            park,” but described <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> as
                            “very upset at the Panamanian document, primarily because it rejects the

                        <salute>Dear Barney:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>For some time I have felt that our treaty negotiations are generally
                        proceeding on the wrong course, and that we should be on a path which is
                        about 90 degrees from the one we are now following.</p>
                    <p>From the days of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName> it
                        has been the stated policy of the Administration that we are going to turn
                        the Canal over to Panama at some point of time, and that we are going to go
                        through a transition period of returning various elements of jurisdiction
                        and sovereignty to them. Our negotiators have visualized a rather long,
                        drawn-out period during which our rights will gradually be whittled away,
                        and yet during which we will be responsible for operation of the waterway. I
                        think this is really the worst of all possible arrangements.</p>
                    <p>The longer we stretch out our responsibility for running the Canal with
                        diminishing rights, the more problems we are going to cause <pb n="135"
                            facs="0160" xml:id="pg_135"/>for management and for everyone connected
                        with the Canal in both governments. Further, we lose the opportunity to
                        create goodwill in Panama, jeopardize our relations following the long,
                        drawn-out period, and gain nothing in public relations with the rest of the
                        world. It is generally my view that if we are going to give the Canal back
                        to Panama anyway, the faster we do it the better, provided we retain for the
                        United States during that period of transition essentially the same rights
                        we have today.</p>
                    <p>Paul Runnestrand has put these ideas together in a paper called “New Treaty
                        Concept.” <note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> I am
                        forwarding a copy of the paper for your information. I support it and think
                        this is the way we should go.</p>

                        at the opportunity to brief senior <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                        >DOD</gloss>officials on Panama Canal Treaty Negotiation developments to
                        date; on the next steps to be taken in the negotiations; and on the
                        philosophy governing the negotiations. He expressed appreciation for the

                        with whom he had been working, including the Secretary of the Army. He was

                    <p>2. (U) <hi rend="italic">Technique for Conducting Negotiations</hi></p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> explained that the
                        negotiating technique is to proceed from agreement on principles to
                        agreement on major issues under each principle and then to a threshold
                        agreement for each principle encompassing the several issues associated with
                        that principle. He said he was proceeding with all deliberate speed in a
                        relaxed, informal atmosphere. The only negotiators who meet are himself and
                        his Deputy Negotiator, and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> and his Deputy.</p>
                    <p>3. (C) <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Negotiations</hi></p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> emphasized that, in
                        his view, it is time for the United States to make good on its commitment to
                        develop a more modern treaty relationship with Panama. This commitment was
                        initially made by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>
                        after consultation with ex-Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. He stated the
                        United States should not wish to be the only country in the world exercising
                        extra-territoriality and asserted that Panama’s consent to United States
                        presence would continue to decline without a more modern treaty. Declining
                        Panamanian consent would probably bring on conflict; in addition, the United
                        States would suffer in Latin American and world opinion. On the other hand,
                        Panamanian acquiescence in our presence would permit the United States to
                        exercise continued control of the Canal enterprise during the life of the
                        new treaty. In essence, the objective of the United States Negotiators is to
                        give Panama the sovereignty it “requires” and retain for the United States
                        what it needs to control and protect the Canal for an extended period. The
                        Panamanians are demonstrating a sense of responsibility during negotiations.
                        They recognize the importance of the Canal to the United States. They also
                        recognize that phased training will be necessary before Panamanians can be
                        considered capable of significant participation in its operation.</p>
                    <p>4. (U) <hi rend="italic">Stages of Current Negotiations</hi></p>
                    <p>a. The eight principles were negotiated in November and December 1973 and
                        agreed to by Panama and the United States (<persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>) in
                        February 1974.</p>
                    <p>b. The Deputy Negotiators developed statements of the major issues for each
                        of the eight principles in February and March 1974. The Chief Negotiators
                        agreed on these statements in early April.<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3"

                    <p>c. Substantive discussions on Principle VI concerning Panamanian
                        participation in the operation and administration of the Canal were held in
                        Panama in late June 1974.<note n="4" xml:id="d49fn4">See <ref target="#d47"
                                >Document 47</ref>.</note> A threshold agreement providing general
                        solutions to the issues associated with Principle VI resulted, constituting
                        a conceptual approach for Panamanian participation in the Canal operation.
                        This occurred earlier than we expected and will permit us to proceed
                        promptly to other issues.</p>
                    <p>d. We will develop similar threshold agreements for the remaining principles,
                        leaving details and the treaty language to be negotiated later.</p>
                    <p>(1) The next matter to be discussed will be Principle VII, Panamanian
                        participation in defense of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>(2) Discussions on rights, land use, compensation to Panama, and finally the
                        toughest issues, duration of the new treaty and expansion rights, will
                        follow.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated he understood
                        that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>was reviewing the United States
                        Unified Command structure world-wide and said he would appreciate an
                        opportunity to be able to inform the Panamanians of developments in this
                        regard which might affect them.</p>
                    <p>6. (U) <hi rend="italic">Outlook for the Future</hi></p>
                    <p>a. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s goal is to
                        develop a draft treaty sometime in early 1975. He hopes to be able to adhere
                        to that goal.</p>
                    <p>b. Possible constraining factors are:</p>
                    <quote><p>(1) There are Panamanian “hard liners,” but, in general, the
                            Panamanians have demonstrated flexibility. They expect to begin their
                            involvement in the Canal in a modest way and agree that the United
                            States must retain control. They see sovereignty, but not continued
                            control, as essential to Panama.</p>
                        <p>(2) Congressional attitudes reflect some United States “hard line”
                            positions. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> will
                            continue to listen to their opinions and explain the Panamanian need for
                            sovereignty with the concomitant agreement for United States control. He
                            recognizes that he will need supportive representations from <gloss

                    <p>c. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> expressed the
                        hope that a satisfactory, reasonable document which protects the United
                        States interests would result from the negotiations.</p>

                        >Bunker</persName>’s reaction to attitudes in the Congress, making specific

                        that only 16 or 17 of the signatories are “hard liners.” Among the
                        remainder, some are not returning to the Senate and others might be
                        persuaded. He added that the Vice President had told him to go slow in 1974
                        but to expedite his efforts in 1975. In addressing Congressional attitudes,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> indicated his
                        concern that Panamanian consent to our presence in the Canal Zone will
                        decline if there continues to be no new treaty.</p>
                    <p>b. The SecDef indicated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had recently updated

                    <p>c. General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> indicated that the
                        Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) had not agreed with the <gloss

                        Talley interjected that CNO had finally agreed with the adopted
                        positions.</p>
                    <p>d. The SecDef asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        to clarify who currently possesses sovereignty over the territory in the
                        Canal Zone. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        responded that under the current treaty the United States may act “as if

                            >Bunker</persName> could probably understand this statement, realizing

                            <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> responded that if a new
                        treaty can be moved through the Senate, only Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> with his deftness can accomplish it.
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> asked Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> if he believed that
                        legislation would be necessary in addition to treaty ratification.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> responded
                        affirmatively. Sec<pb n="140" facs="0165" xml:id="pg_140"/>retary <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> then commented that the House of
                        Representatives would play a part. He added that the Army supports the
                        negotiations, but is concerned about keeping United States control as long
                        as possible. The Army must also take care of its employees, many of whom see
                        negotiating away the Canal Zone to be a highly emotional matter.</p>
                    <p>g. The SecDef asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        whether Panamanian participation in defense of the Canal was merely
                        “hopefully” a cosmetic formula or something that might permit saboteurs to
                        get closer to the Canal. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> responded that there has been some participation to
                        date, and since the concept of a new treaty includes a termination date, at
                        some point Panamanians must participate.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Comment.</hi> There has been no combined defense
                        participation to date; rather, small scale training projects have been
                        accomplished sporadically.</p>
                    <p>h. The SecDef asked whether Panama would ever be able to defend the Canal.
                        General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> responded that he sees
                        two aspects to defense; one, defense against sabotage, and the other
                        traditional (conventional) defense. He thought that combined participation
                        with an effective working relationship would probably enhance security.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated that since
                        the Canal is the best asset that Panama has, Panama would not wish to damage
                        it.</p>
                    <p>i. The Assistant SecDef (<gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss>) stated his
                        concern with respect to the problem created by the apparent attitude in the
                        Senate and stated that he was leery about accelerated treaty efforts in
                        1975. He feared that current optimism and expectations in Panama could lead
                        to an extremely bad situation if no treaty was forthcoming. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> agreed this was a
                        potentially serious problem but stated that the Administration did not
                        desire to present a draft treaty to the Senate in an election year which
                        rules out doing so in 1974 or 1976, leaving only 1975 in the short term.</p>
                    <p>j. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> then asked Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> about the duration of the
                        new treaty. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> replied
                        that Presidential guidelines were to shoot for a treaty of 50 years
                        duration, with an extension of the treaty to accommodate Canal expansion. He
                        pointed out that Panama desires a much shorter duration. He thought
                        agreement on this issue would depend largely on what we can accomplish in
                        meeting Panamanian desires with respect to participation and
                        jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>k. The SecDef asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        what was, in his judgement, the minimum duration probable. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> replied that he could only
                        go on the Presidential guidelines and did not know what else would be
                        acceptable. He pointed out, however, that the United States is depreciating
                        the Canal over 40 years and that it might be feasible to let it go after it
                        has depreciated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>
                        observed <pb n="141" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_141"/>that it was probable that
                        the longer the duration of the new treaty, the more Senate votes for
                        ratification would result. <note n="6" xml:id="d49fn6">A July 12 memorandum

                            and Briefings for Meetings—1974) In his memoir, <persName
                                corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> asserted that the meeting was
                            hostile. He wrote: “When <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                            finished, <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> did not
                            thank him or even use his name. He brusquely read off the first of
                            several prepared questions: ‘Why should we jeopardize our national
                            security by giving up our vital sovereignty?’ The tone was that of a
                            jaded professor addressing a freshman at exam time. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, who was <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>’s senior by thirty-five
                            years, found rudeness unacceptable and aggressive egotism offensive. He
                            sat looking straight ahead as if nothing had been said. An aide worried
                            that the Ambassador had drawn a blank or had not heard. Then he realized
                            that the elderly Vermonter was simply not going to respond to
                            impertinent quizzing. The silence deepened. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> finally jumped in to ease the
                            moment.” <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> added: “He
                                [<persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> ] had proved to
                            all present that the consensus in official Washington and in the press
                            was firmly based: that the secretary of defense was probably the most
                            arrogant, self-centered, opinionated individual in the capital city.”

                        requested an opportunity to talk further with Mr. <persName

                        points which he had made during his 9 July briefing of SecDef.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d50fn2">See <ref target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> He
                        wanted to do this because he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName> had not had much opportunity to talk during that
                        meeting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> proceeded
                        to reiterate the major points covered during the 9 July meeting. A summary
                        of these points follows:</p>
                    <p>a. There is no particular Panamanian time pressure on the United States,
                        probably because of the eight principles already agreed upon. Principle VII,
                        involving Panamanian participation in Canal defense, will be addressed
                        during Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s next visit
                        to Panama, tentatively scheduled for 8 August.</p>
                    <p>b. We do not know how long the negotiations will take to complete.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>(1) They will not be completed in 1974.</item>
                        <item>(2) We may or may not get the treaty through the Senate (Senators
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWL_1">Scott</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMJ_1">Mansfield</persName>, and Fulbright, and
                            Congressman <persName corresp="#p_MTE_1">Morgan</persName> believe that
                            there is a good chance of Senate ratification if the draft treaty is
                            reasonable).</item>
                        <item>(3) Negotiations will probably be complete during 1975; if not, 1976
                            will be a bad year for the treaty to be presented in the Senate.</item>
                        <item>(4) It is conceivable that the treaty could await Senate action for as
                            long as a year or two. Even if this were the case, the fact that a draft
                            treaty had been prepared could relieve tension between the United States
                            and Panama.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>c. The Panamanians are not the most efficient negotiators, as shown by their
                        recent counter-proposal to the formerly agreed-upon threshold agreement
                        concerning Principle VI (Panamanian participation in Canal operation and
                            administration).<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">See <ref target="#d47fn2"

                            <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> that the
                        Panamanian paper is not acceptable as a negotiating paper, but the United
                        States could consider it a philosophical paper to be noted and set aside. He
                        has refrained from pursuing this issue pending receipt of formal Department
                        of Defense comments on the Panamanian proposal.</p>
                    <p>d. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> received a
                        message from Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> to the effect that 10 years was a long time for the
                            negotia<pb n="143" facs="0168" xml:id="pg_143"/>tions to have been in
                        progress. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> told
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> that if
                        the Panamanians persist in “consulting everybody, including businessmen,
                        labor leaders, and students,” on every treaty issue, negotiations will
                        likely last for 10 more years.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4">No record of the

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> explained that
                        except for preliminary, low-key efforts, he had refrained from substantive
                        contacts in Congress. He mentioned that in keeping with instructions from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, he had discussed
                        treaty negotiations several times with Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName>, who thinks there are “a good many things we could
                        do with Panama short of giving up sovereignty and terminating the 1903
                            Treaty.”<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">See <ref target="#d45">Document
                                45</ref>.</note> Senator <persName corresp="#p_MMJ_1"
                            >Mansfield</persName> has told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> that there is no point in talking about the treaty in

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated that if
                            <gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss> is to be disestablished,
                        he would appreciate being able to use this fact during negotiations. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> responded that SecDef
                        had told him Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s idea
                        on making use of such a decision, if and when it is made, makes sense; and
                        that he would see SecDef shortly and clarify for Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> the SecDef’s desires in this regard.
                        (Later, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> informed
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> by telephone that
                        SecDef had agreed that if <gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss>
                        were to be disestablished, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> should first be informed to permit him to convey this
                        information to the Panamanians when he thinks it is appropriate.)</p>
                    <p>4. (C) <hi rend="italic">Concluding Remarks.</hi></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> said that he was glad
                        that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> was keeping in
                        touch with Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName>, as
                        maintaining this contact is important for all. He expressed appreciation for
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s complimentary
                        remarks concerning Department of Defense cooperation with the United States
                        negotiators and remarked that he had been especially interested in
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s views on the
                        Panamanian counter-proposal previously discussed. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> replied that he felt the Panamanian
                        paper to be harmless; that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> had expressed the Panamanian problem as
                        frustration from a long series of disappointments which raised emotions and
                        thus dictated that the Panamanian Government coordinate its negotiating
                        positions with all interested sectors, including the hardliners. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> had subsequently pointed
                        out to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName>
                        that such an approach could further delay negotiations, particu<pb n="144"

                        the tactically important Ancon Hill complex in the Canal Zone. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> asked several questions
                        concerning the specific locations in the photo and was especially interested
                        in the proximity of the Albrook Air Force Base Runway to Ancon Hill and

                                >Torrijos</persName>’ waffling, threatened to pull all Cuban
                            personnel out of Panama, so the Panamanian leader changed course yet
                            again and made recognition official on August 20. (National Archives,

                    <p>We plan to extend the signal to the negotiations by delaying the renewal of
                        talks scheduled for next month. At present no negotiations are going on.
                        Early in September the Panamanians have promised to present a paper on Canal
                        defense arrangements. Instead of the Deputy Negotiators meeting quickly to
                        exchange views on the paper as has been the past pattern at the Deputy
                        Negotiator level, we will take our time in responding. This will push back
                        the timetable for the Principal Negotiator talks scheduled for
                            mid-September.<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">See <ref target="#d57"

                    <p>In executing these steps we will have to monitor Panamanian attitudes closely
                        and perhaps adjust them to changes of mood and circumstance. They are
                        emotional, volatile and immature. Their dispute with United Brands over the

                        reach a showdown, with the possibility of the government intervening or

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>The purpose of this letter is to express my deep concern over recent
                        developments in Panama and the Canal Zone. These developments may have
                        serious implications for the Panama Canal and vital U.S. interests there,
                        and, in addition, may well result in equally serious situations throughout
                        Latin America.</p>
                    <p>In recent weeks, the situation has deteriorated rapidly. The government of
                        Panama has been rapidly drifting to the left. My Panamanian contacts advise
                        me that many Cubans are presently in influential positions in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> regime, and that the General
                        himself is isolated from all but radicals and Communists. Indeed the
                        Communists there are increasingly aggressive and bold.</p>
                    <p>The two developments of greatest concern are Panama’s unilateral resumption
                        of diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the so-called “banana war” against
                        United Brands. The latter has been settled, but not without bitterly
                        anti-American agitation inspired by the government, including the stoning of
                        the United States Embassy by the pro-Communist student federation. The
                        banana war has been held up by government propagandists as a prototype for
                        action against the United States. Moreover, the Panamanian ambassadors to
                        the United States and the United Nations have openly threatened violence
                        against the United States.</p>
                    <p>These activities have been of great concern to many freedom-loving
                        Panamanians who see their nation quickly falling into Communist domination
                        because of recent developments in Cuban activity in Panama and the current
                        Panamanian regime.<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">The Embassy in Panama reported
                            a different reaction to the Panamanian recognition of Cuba: “The GOP’s
                            public treatment of the resumption of relations with Cuba has been
                            decidedly cautious and clearly carefully controlled” to assuage the
                            fears of Panamanian conservative opinion. (Telegram 5291 from Panama

                    <p>I share the concern about current Cuban-Panamanian political activity.
                        Obviously, all of Latin America is watching this situation <pb n="148"
                            facs="0173" xml:id="pg_148"/>closely. Needless to say, any action on the
                        part of the United States that indicates the slightest position of weakness
                        or a willingness to accommodate anti-American sentiment in Panama, would
                        result in many other Latin American countries moving in the same leftward
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>Our negotiations for a new canal treaty are fundamentally in error. More than
                        one-third of the Senate—thirty-five Senators—have sponsored Senate
                        Resolution 301 against the surrender of U.S. sovereignty in the Canal Zone.
                        Any loss of control of the Canal would be extremely detrimental to our vital
                        interests, especially in Latin America. We should make it clear that U.S.
                        vital interests there are not negotiable.</p>

                        <salute>Dear <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I thought it might be useful if I were to pass along to you an estimate of
                        the mood at this end of the negotiating track, as well as some thoughts on
                        possible next steps. I should say at the outset that what follows is more
                        than speculation and intuition. It is based on talks with numerous
                        Panamanians, but most important on a lengthy discussion I had recently with
                        General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The latter was rather unusual in several respects. First, I believe the
                        General had never before visited the Residence for more than a quick
                        entrance and exit—and not even that over the past few years. In this case,
                        he called on Sunday afternoon<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">September
                            22.</note> and asked if I had guests. When I said that Mili and I were
                        alone, he said he would be over. He came and stayed for several
                        hours—including a family supper. He said he had nothing particular in mind,
                        simply that he wanted to visit a friend and relax.</p>
                    <p>At several junctures he stressed that he hoped our meeting and talk could be
                        kept strictly confidential and so I have respected his <pb n="149"
                            facs="0174" xml:id="pg_149"/>wishes. For this reason, the fact of his
                        visit should be held between us. But I think it is important that you have
                        the “feel” of his mood.</p>
                    <p>First, you should know that he has the highest respect for and trust in you
                        and <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. He believes we are
                        all doing our best to push a treaty to a successful conclusion. He is
                        bothered that things seem to be moving so slowly. By this, I think he means
                        the pace of negotiations themselves. But he does not assign the blame to us
                        any more than to his own people. For this reason, he has decided to take a
                        more direct role—in the sense of overseeing—than he has in the past. He has
                        said he is tired of being told by his people that this or that proposal is
                        “unacceptable.” He has said he wants to know <hi rend="italic">why</hi>
                        something cannot be accepted and what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>But a basic source of frustration for him is the lack of anything he can
                        point out to his people as marking progress. He believes we are sincere and
                        have the best intentions. But he notes a striking lack of positive actions.
                        We promised to do something about the lottery sales in the Zone—and nothing
                        happened. We said we would transfer Old and New France Fields—and nothing
                            happened.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">For more information about the
                            above unilateral actions, see <ref target="#d28">Document
                            28</ref>.</note> He understands the difficulties we face on the Hill.
                        But from his point of view, the net result has been little or nothing in
                        terms of forward movement on specifics.</p>
                    <p>This brings me to the main point I wished to share with you. It is clear to
                        me that the one thing at this particular moment that would have the greatest
                        impact here is something we have been considering for some time. That is the
                        appointment of a Panamanian as Vice President of the Canal Company.
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> would regard this as a
                        major step forward and a considerable concession to his views. He could use
                        it inside his government and with the critics as proof positive of US
                        goodwill. He also sees it as a highly useful way in which to establish
                        closer liaison with the Canal Company and the Zone. His representative could
                        come to understand Zone problems and methods of operation so they could be
                        explained to others. And if the General had a problem either with the Zone
                        or on some matter that he thought the Zone could help with, he would have
                        his own representative there as the point of contact.</p>
                    <p>The man he would appoint to this position—and this fact must be tightly held
                        and discussed with no one—is <persName corresp="#p_FVE_1">Edwin
                            Fabrega</persName>. This choice clearly underlines the importance
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> places on this matter,
                        because <persName corresp="#p_FVE_1">Fabrega</persName> is one of the most
                        capable and intelligent men in this Government. He is also a very decent
                        human being. He was Dean of the University when it was an intellectual
                        institution and not a political hothouse. He is currently head of the
                        Institute of Water and Power Resources. I know Edwin and have the highest

                        have decided that the naming of a Panamanian to the Vice Presidency of the

                            10/11/74–7/26/75.</note></p>
                    <p>We understand that Headquarters, United States Southern Command, is
                        participating in the response, so that it will cover both military and Canal
                        Company/Zone Government areas and facilities.</p>
                    <p>Since we must now begin to address the “land use” negotiating issue in its
                        broadest aspect, you may wish to consider the following points.</p>
                    <p>Panama has agreed that the United States shall retain control over areas and
                        facilities necessary for operation and defense of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>To implement the “partnership” spirit implicit in the Principles,
                        however—and, indeed, to be certain of obtaining Panama’s agreement that the
                        areas and facilities we specify are truly “necessary”—it is appropriate that
                        the United States provide a rigorous justification for each of its needs. In
                        the United States Negotiators’ judgment, Panama will not accept nor would it
                        be fitting for the United States to table justifications based on
                        convenience for Canal operation and defense rather than essentiality.</p>
                    <p>In the course of specifying areas and installations essential to the United
                        States’s effective control over operation and defense, moreover, it is
                        appropriate to begin with the premise that the United States treaty offer on
                        “land use” must be more forthcoming than the 1971–72 offer with respect to
                        relinquishment to Panama of areas and facilities. By agreeing to the
                        Principles the United States has moved to a negotiating posture with which
                        the latter would be incompatible.</p>
                    <pb n="152" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                    <p>Finally, in the course of specifying areas and installations it is
                        appropriate to consider that the United States will not require a single,
                        contiguous, monolithic “Canal Area” to exercise its operational and
                        defensive control effectively. All areas and facilities which will appertain
                        to the United States will be specified in the treaty or a suitable companion
                        instrument, and all operational and defensive rights will be exercised with
                        respect to them.</p>
                    <p>It would seem to follow from the foregoing that the Negotiators will have
                        need of a categorization of areas and facilities along the following
                        lines:</p>
                    <p>(1) Immediately and unconditionally releasable to Panama.</p>
                    <p>(2) Immediately and unconditionally releasable with appropriate arrangements
                        to the effect that Panama will not use them in ways prejudicial to the
                        performance of essential activities of Canal operation and defense.</p>
                    <p>(3) Immediately releasable provided the United States retains access
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>(4) Immediately releasable provided Panama agrees to share their use with the
                        United States (for example, joint training areas).</p>
                    <p>(5) Releasable at some point during the first five-year period of the treaty,
                        under any of the circumstances described in (1) through (4) above.</p>
                    <p>(6) Not releasable for the treaty’s lifetime insofar as the United States can
                        now determine.</p>
                    <p>For the categorization to be most useful to the Negotiators, areas and
                        installations within each category should be identified in order of priority
                        for Canal operation and defense.</p>
                    <p>It would also seem essential for negotiation and treaty-drafting purposes to
                        identify each by approximate size and location, by facilities located
                        thereon, and by the purpose for which it is now used. In the case of those
                        not falling within category (1), a statement justifying their inclusion in
                        another category would be needed. In the case of those included in
                        categories (2)–(5), we would need a description of the particular
                        limitations on their releasibility. In the case of those included in
                        category (6) we would need an unassailable statement of justification.<note

                    <p>The matter of air space is inextricably linked to the “land use” issue. Thus
                        the Negotiators would need a specification and justification of United
                        States requirements in that regard.</p>
                    <p>The matter of “related activities” poses a special problem.</p>
                    <p>In response to the Negotiators’ informal assertion to Panama that they would
                        be unable to entertain a proposal to discontinue these activities, Panama
                        has said privately that as a general matter the activities may be continued
                        but that the proper “cover” must be found, for Panama’s domestic
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>Clearly we cannot cover these by relating them to any significant measure of
                        essentiality for Canal defense. Clearly Panama cannot accept a cover
                        relating to “hemispheric defense” or “strategic Panama”—concepts which it
                        has rejected flatly. Clearly, also, it would not seem to be in the United
                        States’ interests that a treaty with Panama hinge on this issue.</p>
                    <p>The Negotiators will welcome recommendations in this regard.<note n="4"

                    <p>We recognize that categorization of land/water areas and facilities as well
                        as air space requirements is an onerous task. Yet it is an essential one,
                        and urgent in that we shall have difficulty avoiding some general discussion
                        of these matters as we discuss the administration-defense-jurisdiction
                        package at the October 28–November 6 session of the Chief Negotiators in
                        Panama. It would be helpful if the Negotiators’ Support Group might be
                        furnished with any proposals from Canal Zone agencies as they are received,
                        so that the Group might in turn present recommendations for negotiating
                        positions as promptly as possible. As circumstances develop it may become

                        important elements for important negotiating trade-offs. Thus we would be
                        grateful if you would arrange that the proposals for those positions be

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> noted that failure

                            between our two Governments,” adding, “Congressional reaction to
                            Panama’s recent recognition of Cuba has been light and I do not
                            anticipate any significant degree of criticism if this waiver is

                        Foreign Military Sales Act, as Amended</p>
                    <p>On April 17, 1974, Panama seized an American fishing vessel for having
                        engaged in fishing more than twelve miles from the Panamanian <pb n="155"
                            facs="0180" xml:id="pg_155"/>coast but within Panama’s claimed 200-mile
                        territorial sea. Section 3(b) of the Foreign Military Sales Act, as amended,
                        requires the suspension of all sales, credits and guaranties under the Act
                        to any country which has so seized an American fishing vessel. Such
                        suspension is to remain in effect for a period of one year from the date of
                        the seizure in question. The President is authorized to waive this
                        suspension either (a) if reasonable assurances are received from the country
                        concerned that future violations of Section 3(b) will not occur or (b) if
                        the President determines that such a waiver is important to the security of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>The United States Ambassador in Panama has discussed the matter of the
                        seizure with a senior official of the Government of Panama, who has informed
                        the Ambassador that the commander of the patrol boat which effected the
                        April 17 seizure had acted on his own initiative, and that as a matter of
                        policy Panama would not rely upon seizures of foreign fishing boats to
                        implement its territorial sea claims. These representations constitute
                        reasonable assurances that future violations of U.S. fishing rights will not
                        occur.</p>

                    <p>6409. Subject: U.S.-PANAMA TREATY NEGOTIATIONS: Report of Chief Negotiators’
                        Session October 27–November 7, 1974, Contadora Island, Panama. From
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I.</p>
                    <p>Panama has accepted the package proposal I offered on the critical issues of
                        Canal operation, Canal defense, and the exercise of jurisdiction.
                        Accordingly it is reasonable to say that a new treaty is in sight. The <pb
                            n="156" facs="0181" xml:id="pg_156"/>parties have agreed to a schedule
                        of negotiation designed to conclude it by next March.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d57fn2">In telegram 1963 from Jerusalem, November 8, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> wrote: “I have no problems
                            with trying to complete the treaty by March.” (National Archives, <gloss

                            Box 4, Key Documents)</note></p>
                    <p>Whether it will be possible to do so depends on negotiating quickly the next
                        two issues—compensation to Panama and the return of Zone lands to Panama,
                        and then on arriving at a satisfactory formula for handling the final,
                        difficult issues of the treaty’s duration and of an option for expansion of
                        the Canal.</p>
                    <p>The Panamanians were gratified at the United States proposals which would
                        restore their “sovereignty.” As a result they agreed to language which, in
                        my judgment, would guarantee effective United States control of Canal
                        operation and defense through the treaty’s lifetime.</p>
                    <p>That is not to say that they did not bargain vigorously, and in some
                        instances I chose to accept their concepts and language in order to secure
                        their commitment to matters of particular concern to the United States. That
                        was also the case with respect to the issue of jurisdictional control. The
                        bargaining process, in fact, benefits the United States. The Panamanians now
                        cannot say that the United States imposed its will upon them.</p>
                    <p>These proposals are incorporated in three separate “Threshold
                        Agreements”—agreements on concepts to guide the treaty drafting—which the
                        Chief Negotiators have initialed. The texts follow.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d57fn3">Not printed; see footnote 6 below.</note> It is of
                        course understood between the parties that “Threshold Agreements” are not
                        immutable. All or parts of them are susceptible to the trade-off process
                        which will inevitably occur toward the end of the negotiation. These
                        agreements constitute the most that the United States can obtain thus far in
                        this give-and-take exercise.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ comment to me that
                        the Agreements have “broken the back of the treaty problem” may be an
                        overstatement, but I am hopeful it is not.</p>

                            the United States would retain in the new treaty the essential
                            provisions to permit it to defend and operate the canal efficiently and
                            effectively while the treaty is in force.” He added, “particularly
                            disturbing is the omission from the ‘threshold agreement on jurisdiction

                            Panama Canal Treaty Negotiations [1])</note> and to create now a
                        “Working Group” to begin planning for the first stage of Panama’s
                        participation in Canal operation. He expressed considerable satisfaction at
                        these earnests of the United States desire to move quickly toward a new
                        relationship, and I learned subsequently that these unilateral actions
                        occasioned more Panamanian flexibility in negotiating the issue of Canal
                        defense than would otherwise have appeared. I believe that we should now
                        implement the two actions.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                    <p>Summarizing what the United States has achieved from the negotiation of the
                        tripartite offer:</p>
                    <p>1. Panama has agreed that the United States shall have the “primary
                        responsibility,” during the treaty’s lifetime, for both Canal operations and
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>2. Panama has agreed to grant the basic operating rights the United States
                        requires, including the use of areas, free and unimpeded movement, and
                        rights to guard installations, to control the setting of tolls <pb n="158"
                            facs="0183" xml:id="pg_158"/>and the navigation of ships, and to
                        regulate labor relations. They have also agreed to grant the United States
                        rights in separate agreements to provide services such as schools, hospitals
                        and public utilities.</p>
                    <p>3. Panama has agreed to language which enables the United States to act
                        unilaterally to defend the Canal.</p>
                    <p>4. Panama has agreed that the United States may retain military activities
                        not related to operation and defense of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>5. Panama has agreed to a joint commitment to ensure the permanent neutrality
                        of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>6. Panama has agreed that civilian employees of the Canal Company may be
                        afforded special privileges and immunities for a period to be specified in
                        the treaty. The Minister indicated that these could be substantially similar
                        to those offered to other United States employees under a <gloss
                            target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>7. Panama has receded from (a) its position that it should have sole
                        responsibility for “local defense” of the Canal; (b) its insistence that the
                        United States commit itself to progressive dismantling of the physical
                        United States military presence; and (c) its insistence that the United
                        States commit itself explicitly to removing that presence entirely upon the
                        termination of the treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="center">V.</p>
                    <p>For its part, the United States has agreed to divest itself of the
                        appurtenances of sovereignty which are not required for the discharge of its
                        responsibilities for Canal operation and defense and which Panama has
                        considered to be offensive.</p>
                    <p>There is to be no “Canal Zone,” nor “Canal Zone Government.” Panama will
                        acquire criminal jurisdiction over its nationals and jurisdiction over
                        private civil matters immediately the treaty enters into force. Within three
                        years thereafter, civilian United States courts will disappear and Panama
                        will acquire general police authority.</p>
                    <p>In addition the United States has offered Panama meaningful participation—in
                        effect a “partnership”—in Canal operation and defense. Finally the United
                        States has offered to renegotiate the treaty five years before its
                        expiration date, to assure that implementation of the treaty’s provisions is
                        being carried out in ways such that Panama will be capable of assuming
                        responsibility for Canal operation and defense at the end of the treaty
                        period. Both parties also understand that renegotiation would permit
                        discussion of arrangements whereby the United States could assist Panama
                        with some aspects of Canal defense in the post-treaty period.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Question of the Approach to the Congress</p>
                    <p>I regret having missed your meeting November 21 on this subject,<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d58fn2">No record of this meeting has been found.</note> because
                        I had hoped to present for consideration the arguments in favor of an
                        exceedingly cautious approach to the Congress at this juncture. There are
                        seven of them. The Negotiating Staff joins me unanimously in forwarding them
                        to you and the other interested officers.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">I.</hi> The Arguments</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">A treaty is “in sight”—but far from certain.</hi> It
                        would seem unwise to start selling a commodity we do not yet have excellent
                        prospects of putting our hands on.</p>
                    <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The Defense Department is almost certainly not willing
                            to be helpful at this time in any approaches to the Congress</hi>—<hi
                            rend="italic">and might well be unhelpful.</hi> That is so for these
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>has not yet seen, in the draft
                        Threshold Agreements, the full protection of its interests. You intend over
                        the course of the negotiation to obtain that full measure of protection, of
                        course—but it is not there at this time.</p>
                    <p>2. There are those in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, in positions of
                        some importance, who do not wish a new treaty and will resist, vigorously,
                        any effort to involve <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>in preparing the
                        way for a treaty in the Congress.</p>
                    <p>3. There are those in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, in positions of
                        particular importance, who although favoring a new treaty will be extremely
                        skittish about involving <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>in
                        congressional approaches, for fear of their impact on members of the Armed
                        Services Committees, many of whom oppose a treaty. They will be most
                        reluctant to go to bat until they are compelled to do so.</p>
                    <p>4. Rumors are rife in <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>that Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> has ordered a review
                        of all existing <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>positions on major
                        worldwide issues, from “détente” to Panama, with a view to ascertaining
                        whether the <pb n="160" facs="0185" xml:id="pg_160"/><gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>positions should not be “hardened”. The
                        idea seems to be that vital “lines of communication” are being
                        jeopardized.</p>
                    <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Any full-blown initiative with the Congress would almost
                            certainly provoke the congressional opposition into retaliation, and we
                            are not yet ready to counter it.</hi> When the Negotiators are convinced
                        that a treaty is within easy reach, then we can bear up under the
                        opposition’s attack and counter it. Perhaps we might be in such a position
                        by early January.</p>
                    <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Extensive consultations with Congress significantly
                            increase the possibility of leaks.</hi> Panama, at least, could not
                        stand leaks now, and the course of negotiation would be very much prejudiced
                        by them. Later, Panama will be in a better position on this score.</p>
                    <p>E. <hi rend="italic">Premature congressional contacts could prejudice our
                            tactical position vis-à-vis Panama in the negotiation.</hi> The
                        Panamanians would learn of it promptly, and would interpret it as an effort
                        by the Administration to make certain it can move a treaty through the
                        Congress. We need to continue to use congressional approval as leverage in
                        our bargaining with the Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>F. <hi rend="italic">Given the Administration’s domestic difficulties at this
                            time, it is doubtful that the White House (the “domestic side”) would
                            want any more problems with the Congress than it already has.</hi> An
                        organized approach now to the Congress on the Panama matter would provoke
                        the congressional opposition and, thus, a “problem”. One can conceive of a
                        treaty with Panama being viewed as a foreign-policy coup, but a domestic
                        political disaster. At the least we should be moving slowly and cautiously
                        enough in the congressional approaches to give the White House time to
                        provide us with critical, not off-hand, guidance.</p>
                    <p>G. <hi rend="italic">There is in fact very little which you can say to
                            members of the Congress, at this time</hi>, which (a) you have not
                        already said, or (b) is so general in nature that your approaches could not
                        be truly productive. We should bear in mind the futility of the approaches
                        made in the <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1">Anderson</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_WD_1">Ward</persName> negotiation—several hundred individual
                        calls, in all. They were made too early: the general reaction was “I’ll make
                        up my mind when you show me a draft treaty.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">II.</hi> Suggestion for a “Cautious”
                        Approach</p>
                    <p>A two-track system might be in order.</p>
                    <p>One track would consist of efforts aimed, not directly at the Congress, but
                        rather at private groups which are influential with the Congress. We plan to
                        forward a separate memorandum to you on this subject but, briefly, we have
                        in mind, as mechanisms, (a) a few major speeches, (b) articles in leading
                        periodicals, (c) formation of a Citizens Committee, (d) briefings of
                        Editorial Boards of major non-Eastern newspapers, (3) démarches to <persName

                    <pb n="161" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_161"/>
                    <p>The second track might go somewhat like this.</p>
                    <p>You would brief the Secretary on what we perceive, at this juncture, as the
                        shape of a new treaty, and suggest that the following steps might now be
                        appropriate.</p>
                    <p>1. The Legislative Liaison Staff of the White House—and perhaps Ambassador
                        Rumsfeld as well—would be informed as to the possible shape of the treaty,
                        and its advice sought on the timing and nature of any approaches to the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>2. The majority and minority leadership of the Congress would also be briefed
                        on the possible shape of the new treaty, and their advice sought on
                        congressional approaches.</p>
                    <p>3. The Vice President-designate would be similarly briefed, and his advice
                        sought.</p>
                    <p>4. We would proceed thereafter in accordance with the advice and guidance
                        received.</p>
                    <p>5. Depending on the nature of the advice and guidance, members of the
                        Congressional Relations and Treaty staffs of the Department would move into
                        a low-key educational effort aimed at selected congressional staff
                        members.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>While the Panamanians always are unpredictable, we made significant progress
                        during my last visit to Panama and for the first time I feel I can say that
                        a treaty is in sight.</p>
                    <p>Panama accepted (in the form of initialed conceptual agreements) a package
                        proposal which I made to them combining defense, administration and
                        jurisdiction (summary attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">Attached but not
                            printed. For more information on the threshold agreements, see <ref
                                target="#d57">Document 57</ref>.</note> In essence, we gave them the
                        jurisdictional rights so important to their sense of national sovereignty in
                        exchange for their agreement that we have the primary right to operate and
                        defend the Canal during the life of the treaty. They also agreed to commit
                        themselves to join us in guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the
                        Canal.</p>
                    <p>Acceptance of this package was essential to a new treaty. If we have success
                        in dealing with the remaining four issues, I believe we may be able to
                        arrive at a treaty by next spring. This should give us a good chance of
                        getting Congressional approval in time to avoid the possibility of the
                        treaty becoming an issue in the Presidential campaign.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Revised Presidential Guidance</p>
                    <p>Between now and March, our schedule calls for taking up four remaining
                        issues. I do not anticipate much trouble on two of them: how much we pay
                        Panama for using the Canal, and how much non-essential land we return to
                        Panama. The other two will be difficult, and I will have to ask for some
                        relaxation of existing Presidential guidance in order to handle them.</p>
                    <p>The guidance calls for a 50-year treaty with an additional 30 to 50 years if
                        the Canal is expanded. It is clear to me that this is unrealistic. Panama
                        could not accept it politically. I shall have to ask for greater flexibility
                        so that I could be able to propose, for example, a significantly shorter
                        period of US control of Canal operations, say to the year 2000 or perhaps
                        less, in exchange for a clear US defense responsibility of longer
                        duration.</p>
                    <pb n="163" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_163"/>
                    <p>The other difficult area is the question of Canal expansion. As the
                        Panamanians tend to suspect that our interests in long-term options to
                        expand are a disguised attempt to get US perpetuity, the question of
                        extending the duration of the treaty in the event we expand the Canal may
                        have to be left for future negotiation.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the Canal is an aging utility. Its commercial—and its
                        military value—may be diminishing. Therefore, we will probably want the
                        treaty to include options for us to expand. However, studies which have
                        examined the value of an expanded Canal in comparison with alternative modes
                        of transportation indicate that the cost-effectiveness of an expanded Canal,
                        whether sea-level or lock, is debatable. The issue should be considered as
                        part of a national transportation policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">An Educational Effort</p>
                    <p>Although these are complicated questions, I hope we can resolve them with the
                        Panamanians by the spring. However, to get the treaty through Congress will
                        require strong support by the Administration and a fairly intensive, but
                        low-key, effort with both Congress and the public. To date, our opponents on
                        the Hill have had the field virtually to themselves, for we have not wanted
                        to inflame passions before we were relatively certain that a treaty was
                        possible. Now that it does appear possible, I believe we should begin a
                        low-key educational effort now.</p>
                    <p>As we see it, our effort would be built around a series of meetings between
                        senior State officials and key undecided Senators. We also are thinking of
                        establishing a citizens’ committee—perhaps drawing from the <persName

                        Panamanian people to accept a reasonable treaty.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Defense Department’s Role</p>
                    <p>Throughout the negotiations I have coordinated closely with the Defense
                        Department. They have been very cooperative even though we have made some
                        pretty heavy demands on them. When the time comes we want Defense to join us
                        in a coordinated approach to influence Congressional opinion in favor of the
                        treaty.</p>
                    <pb n="164" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_164"/>
                    <p>However, it is possible that Defense may become increasingly reluctant to
                        support our efforts to get a treaty. In my conversation with Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName> last August, and
                        from other indications we have had from the Pentagon since then, I sense a
                        growing concern over the problems of inflation and Congressional support as
                        they relate to the Defense budget. In view of this, Defense might well
                        decide that they do not want to promote anything on the Hill which might
                        antagonize Congress. Clearly, Defense now believes that some key people in
                        Congress who have a voice in shaping Defense appropriations are irritated or
                        uneasy with the idea of a new treaty. The Pentagon therefore might hesitate
                        to expend their credit with the Hill on this issue—which they see as
                        primarily beneficial to State rather than Defense.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, I expect this new, more liberal Congress to look with
                        greater favor on a new treaty. We may be able to persuade Defense that they
                        might strengthen their hand in Congress by joining us in advocating the
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>While there has been and will be a lot of opposition to this new treaty, I
                        believe that eventually it will be a positive political factor, both
                        domestically and in our foreign relations, and will serve as one more piece
                        of evidence of our determination to construct a new, more mature
                        relationship with the rest of the world. It will be especially helpful to
                        the course of your “new dialogue” with Latin America.</p>

                    <p>Over the past few days (December 2–5), I have met with several members of
                        Congress for informal discussions of the Panama problem. The MOC involved
                        were:</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>Senator Roman Hruska</item>
                        <item>Senator John Tower</item>
                        <item>Senator Glen Beall</item>
                        <item>Senator Sam Nunn</item>
                        <item>Rep. Wayne Hays</item>
                        <item>Senator Robert Taft</item>
                        <item>Senator Paul Fannin</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>I took the same general approach with each one, as follows:</p>
                    <p>I was in town on consultation with the Department of State and other
                        agencies. I had heard that the MOC concerned had an interest in the Panama
                        situation and I wanted to share with them some of the perceptions that had
                        come to me through living and working in Panama for the past eight months. I
                        said I could not get into the nuts and bolts of negotiations because they
                        were in midstream and were, in any case, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s responsibility. But I thought it
                        might be useful to them—as they viewed the situation now and in the
                        future—to have an idea of the way the problem looked from the other end.</p>
                    <p>I usually gave a quick, thumbnail sketch of Panama today—a “revolutionary”
                        government, moving ahead economically, but with plenty of problems
                        (inflation, unemployment, etc.), and with political forces ranging from
                        extreme left to extreme right. The one issue—indeed the <hi rend="italic"
                            >only</hi> issue—on which I found unanimity was on the need for a change
                        in status of the Canal Zone. While individual Panamanians might differ with
                        one another concerning the specific shape of changes that should take place,
                        they were solidly united in insisting that major changes were long overdue.
                        I said it was my judgment that the present Government and most thinking
                        Panamanians wished to have those changes occur in an atmosphere of
                        friendship and cooperation with the United <pb n="166" facs="0191"
                            xml:id="pg_166"/>States. They had no illusions, for example, about being
                        able to take over and run the Canal immediately or even in a few years. But
                        they wanted to move in the direction of increasing participation and
                        responsibility. Similarly, they had no capability to take over defense of
                        the Canal in the short term. Here again, they wanted to work with
                        us—steadily increasing their own capability for military defense through
                        training, joint exercises, etc.</p>
                    <p>But our view was that for the duration of a new treaty, the U.S. would and
                        should retain primary responsibility for the operation and defense of the
                        Canal. I believed most Panamanians understood this and accepted it.</p>
                    <p>In the long-run, I said, it seemed to me that the only real guarantee of
                        continued successful and smooth operation of the Canal was through Panama’s
                        wholehearted cooperation. Similarly, there was no way in the world to
                        guarantee the successful protection of the Canal in a physical and
                        psychological climate of hostility and confrontation.</p>
                    <p>For Panama, the principal immediate goal was our recognition of her
                        sovereignty over the territory through which the Canal passes. They could
                        not accept rules adopted 70 years ago under which a Panamanian could be
                        arrested for speeding or some other offense and find himself being tried
                        under U.S. laws, by U.S. judges and sentenced to a U.S. jail. The rules of
                        the game as they have been applied for the past 70 years were simply not
                        good enough for 1975.</p>
                    <p>In this context, I could see no reason why we could not shape a new
                        relationship that took Panamanian aspirations into consideration while
                        preserving what were for us the major interests—continued effective
                        operation and protection of the Canal. Moreover, I felt this could be done
                        in a way that would put U.S.-Panama relations on a new and modern
                        footing—setting an example to all for the way in which a large world power
                        could deal fairly and honorably with a small but proud country.</p>
                    <p>If we failed to reach a new agreement—or if we got one and then had it turned
                        down by the Congress—it was clear to me that we would quickly move into an
                        atmosphere of tension, of demonstrations, with riots and violence probable.
                        I did not believe any American could think without concern of the prospect
                        of U.S. troops having to use force to impose its will on Panamanian
                        citizens—to say nothing of having to kill many of them. I doubted that the
                        Congress or the American people would welcome a new “mini Algeria”<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">Presumably a reference to the war between Algerian
                            nationalists and the French from 1954 to 1962.</note> and perhaps having
                        to send a division of armed troops to a small country to show how tough we
                            <pb n="167" facs="0192" xml:id="pg_167"/>could be. In such a situation,
                        opinion in Latin America, and indeed throughout the world, would clearly be
                        on Panama’s side and against us. We would be attacked by the entire world,
                        in the press, at the UN, etc. And then, if we tried to work out a new
                        arrangement, it would be done in a spirit of bitterness and hatred—and would
                        doubtless produce far less for us than we now can reasonably expect.</p>
                    <p>It seemed foolhardy to me to follow this latter course, when the road to an
                        amicable and cooperative agreement was open.</p>
                    <p>All of the Senators expressed their appreciation that I had taken the trouble
                        to call on them. Most said that the discussion had given them a quite
                        different insight into the problem than they had before. The biggest problem
                        cited by almost all of them was the absence of any clear support among their
                        constituents for change in Panama. Most people looked at the problem in
                        simplistic terms—“we dug the ditch and paid for it; why should we give it
                        away?” Many of them said that the only mail they received on the problem was
                        along this line. They underlined the need for broader public education and
                        information.</p>
                    <p>Some of the individual reactions follow:</p>
                    <p>Sen. Hruska: He was worried about what some future Panamanian government
                        might do under a revised treaty—demanding more and more concessions. He was
                        concerned that any change might open the door to increased unfriendly
                        foreign influence. He also recalled the “flag incident” of 1964 which
                        produced rioting and some bloodshed. He thought the U.S. commander who
                        “protected our flag” was a hero.<note n="3" xml:id="d60fn3">The “flag
                            incident” touched off the January 1964 riots in the Canal Zone. See <ref
                                target="frus1964-68v31#d367"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                    Relations,</hi> 1964–1968, vol. XXXI, South and Central America;
                                Mexico, Documents 367</ref> and <ref target="frus1964-68v31#d368"
                                >368</ref>.</note> Nonetheless, he was reasonable during our talk
                        and willing to admit elements of the problem that he had not fully
                        considered before. (COMMENT: a likely negative vote but perhaps could be
                        swayed by sufficient mail from his home state or through the arguments of
                        respected colleagues.) </p>
                    <p>Sen. Tower: Stressed the lack of support for any change on the part of his
                        Texas constituency. But he did say that he was prepared to support a treaty
                        that adequately protected our basic interests. (COMMENT: an intelligent man;
                        more receptive than I had expected. But he will want to put any treaty under
                        a Senatorial microscope.)</p>
                    <p>Sen. Beall: After hearing me out, said he recognized how easy it was for some
                        of his colleagues to get swept up by emotion without looking hard at all the
                        facts. Said he was happy to get a reasoned and balanced viewpoint. Argued
                        that “people need to know more.” <pb n="168" facs="0193" xml:id="pg_168"
                        />(COMMENT: thoughtful and receptive; can be persuaded by facts and
                        logic.)</p>
                    <p>Sen. Nunn: Also quite reasonable. Appreciated getting facts and viewpoints he
                        had not considered. But noted there was little or no support for change.
                        Noted that members of the DAR and other groups were opposed, and were highly
                        vocal. He stressed the need for considerable broadened education—well in
                        advance of presentation of a final treaty to the Congress. (COMMENT: another
                        intelligent and responsible man who listens to facts and appreciates
                        insights that he had not heard or considered.)</p>
                    <p>Rep. Hays: Listened very little. Talked at length about the
                        “untrustworthiness” of all Latins. Said we could not trust them to live up
                        to any agreement. If he were President, he would simply tell the Panamanians
                        that we were going to live by the agreement of 1903 and if they didn’t like
                        it, that was too bad. (COMMENT: a negative vote on anything to do with a new
                        treaty or any concessions to Panama. Not susceptible to facts or
                        argument.)</p>
                    <p>Sen. Taft: Listened carefully. But expressed concern that the Panamanians
                        would continue to press for more and more concessions once an agreement was
                        reached. Thought that our ability to protect the Canal and resist physical
                        pressures would be greater under the present treaty’s concession of
                        sovereign rights than if we abandoned them in a new arrangement. Was
                        impressed by the argument that the use of force to impose our will could
                        mean killing perhaps hundreds of people. That was an unpleasant thought.
                        (COMMENT: intelligent, reasonable. Can be approached with sound arguments.
                        Will probably view any treaty through legalistic eyes.)</p>
                    <p>Sen. Fannin: Listened carefully. Very much appreciated getting a new point of
                        view. Noted that technological changes (in pipelines, bulk cargo conveyors,
                        etc.) might well diminish the importance of the Canal in a shorter time than
                        most people realized. Was interested to hear that Panama is, in fact,
                        considering putting in a new oil pipeline and studying a bulk-cargo conveyor
                        system. (COMMENT: reasonable, rational, intelligent. Can be influenced by
                        thoughtful argument.)</p>

                    <p>PNA 1035. Sub: Visit of Negotiators “Support Group”.</p>
                    <p>1. Negotiators “Support Group,” which is visiting here to discuss
                        compensation and land use issues,<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d55">Document 55</ref>.</note> has requested a great amount
                        of detailed information on our employees. In order to further the spirit of
                        cooperation between the Company and the Support Group, I have authorized
                        that the Support Group be provided with the requested data. I am, however,
                        dismayed by the inference of distrust in their requests, by the considerable
                        workload required by their requests and, above all, by the implication of
                        further inquiry and debate on our judgments on personnel policies.</p>
                    <p>2. Data which the Support Group has requested, and which we should have
                        available for them by early next week, include computer print outs of
                        alphabetical list of over 15000 employees, sequence listing by citizenship,
                        sequence listing showing whether each employee receives tropical
                        differential and complete copy of role and gang by citizenship. This
                        comprises a print out package about one foot high containing the
                        company/government’s complete personnel data. Request was made by AID
                        technician accompanying support group. But initiative for information
                        apparently comes from Group Chairman <persName corresp="#p_WRR_1"
                            >Wyrough</persName> who wants to obtain a better “feel” as to Canal
                        Administration’s continuing need for U.S. employees and future requirement
                        to pay U.S. employees in post treaty period additional retention incentives.
                        Alternatively, we were requested to supply Support Group with master copy of
                        our computer tape on employees (I am not prepared to authorize this
                        request).</p>
                    <p>3. Essential issue is how much money might be saved by changing U.S.–non-U.S.
                        employment mix and how these savings might affect compensation package we
                        have developed here with Support Group. It is doubtful that data we are
                        providing will allow Support Group to make meaningful judgments on these
                        critical issues. Nor do I believe that it is proper for negotiators to
                        involve themselves in judgments on the number of U.S. employees (and their
                        pay) which the future Canal Administration will need in order to effectively
                        run the Canal. Our <pb n="170" facs="0195" xml:id="pg_170"/>present
                        judgments on savings and costs, while we believe they are prudent and
                        supportable, are not immutable. We will be refining our data during the
                        coming weeks. But this data should not be questioned and debated in
                        independent terms of financing the compensation package to Panama. As long
                        as the U.S. has the responsibility for operating the Canal, these are
                        managerial judgments which should be left to those with the experience and
                        responsibility. Warm regards.</p>

                        Canal Negotiations Working Group has given the most careful consideration to

                            Box 8, Chron 1974)</note> The views of Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_PDS_1">Parker</persName> and General Rosson were considered
                        in the process.</p>
                    <p>We examined the primary objectives of the American work force under a new
                        treaty, and then the minimum requirements to achieve those goals. Throughout
                        we kept in mind the difficulties which you cited concerning obtaining
                        Panamanian agreement to an acceptable level of privileges and immunities for
                        Canal Administration U.S. citizen employees.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Defense considers there to be no feasible alternative to
                        uniform coverage of Canal Administration U.S. personnel, to include their
                        dependents, wholly under a Status of Forces Agreement. Options, such as
                        securing a right to pay a cost of living allowance in lieu of seeking
                        commissary and PX privileges, are not considered viable <pb n="171"
                            facs="0196" xml:id="pg_171"/>because much more is involved than the cost
                        of living aspect. For example, a cost of living allowance instead of <gloss
                            target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> purchase privileges would violate the
                        fundamental principle of uniformity of treatment of U.S. and non-U.S.
                        citizen employees. Moreover, it would increase Canal operating costs as well
                        as further increase and highlight the disparity between the compensation of
                        U.S. and Panamanian workers.</p>
                    <p>To operate the waterway efficiently and effectively and concurrently to
                        increase progressively Panamanian participation in Canal Administration, it
                        is essential that there be no disparity between the privileges and rights
                        enjoyed by the U.S. citizen employees of the Forces and those of the Canal
                        Administration. Therefore, the Defense Department considers it necessary
                        that the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> must embrace the total U.S.
                        citizen work force because to do otherwise would be patently unfair and
                        inequitable. More significantly, it would place in serious jeopardy the
                        Canal Administration’s ability to accomplish its operation and training
                        missions while the treaty is in force.</p>
                    <p>The detailed position paper attached explains the position of the Defense
                            Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">Not attached and not

                    <p>It is recommended that:</p>
                    <p>1. benefits, privileges, and immunities for U.S. Government personnel who are
                        U.S. nationals engaged in the operation and defense of the Canal apply
                        equally and uniformly to all U.S. citizen personnel, to include their
                        dependents, whether <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> or Canal

                        civilian employees as well as <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss>
                        personnel.</p>
                    <p>3. the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> or other treaty provisions not
                        restrict the right of the United States to provide to U.S. citizen personnel
                        whatever pay or other incentive, differentials, or allowances it deems
                        necessary to recruit and retain the number of U.S. citizen personnel with
                        required skills to assure the U.S. unimpaired capability to exercise its
                        rights and meet its responsibilities under the treaty, including the
                        training of Panamanians to assume full responsibility in the post-treaty
                        period.</p>
                    <p>4. the prospective treaty not restrict the organizational form or internal
                        structuring of the Canal Administration within the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department very much appreciates your efforts to secure a <gloss

                        Administration U.S. citizen employees included in the agreement. We believe
                        the United <pb n="172" facs="0197" xml:id="pg_172"/>States is being most
                        concessionary to Panama in the area of jurisdiction and for this reason, the
                        Defense Department position, as set forth in this communication, deserves
                        the utmost consideration. In this connection, we will do all possible to

                    <p>Now there has been a negotiating breakthrough: a new treaty is in sight.</p>
                    <p>Presidential decisions are needed, however, to implement the breakthrough.
                        The critical background for making them is this:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Continuation of the existing regime in the Panama Canal
                            Zone increases the risk of direct confrontation with Panama . . . and
                            consequent hemispheric repercussions. We have already delayed for 10
                            years in fulfilling a bipartisan U.S. commitment to conclude a new
                            treaty.</hi></p>
                    <pb n="173" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_173"/>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">A new treaty could constitute a striking foreign-policy
                            achievement for the Administration.</hi></p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">It will not be easy, of course, to move a treaty through
                            the Senate. But the real problem derives more from ignorance than
                            antipathy. And with strong Administration support we believe
                            ratification will be possible.</hi></p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">We should also consider that, from the viewpoint of
                            “managing” the Panama problem, it is probably better to have a treaty
                            which the Congress might hold for a lengthy period than have no treaty
                            at all.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Status of Negotiations</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Panama has accepted a package of “conceptual agreements”
                            which <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> offered</hi> on
                        three important negotiating issues: how the Canal is to be operated . . .
                        how it is to be defended . . . and under what jurisdictional
                            arrangements.<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">See <ref target="#d57">Document
                                57</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>In essence Panama will obtain jurisdictional rights giving it the sense of
                        sovereignty it requires . . . and, in addition, some participation in Canal
                        operation and defense. The United States will retain primary rights to
                        operate and defend the Canal for the treaty’s lifetime.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, Panama has agreed that the United States may join with it in
                        “guaranteeing” that the Canal will remain open, on a non-discriminatory
                        basis, permanently. That gives the United States the political basis—after
                        the treaty ends—to assure that our interests in the Canal are protected.</p>
                    <p>And until the treaty ends, the United States will have the right to act
                        unilaterally to defend the Canal.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">All this represents significant progress toward a
                            treaty.</hi></p>
                    <p>Four issues remain to be negotiated. Two of them—how much we pay Panama for
                        our Canal rights, and how much non-essential land we return to Panama—should
                        not pose insurmountable problems. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> will be addressing them with the Panamanians in early
                            January.<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">See <ref target="#d66">Document
                                66</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The remaining two will be very difficult: how long the new
                            treaty will last . . . and whether the United States will have exclusive
                            rights for expanding the Canal’s capacity.</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Existing Presidential Guidance</p>
                    <p>The outstanding instructions on the two difficult issues are now almost 4
                        years old . . . permit us to offer Panama even less favorable treatment than
                        we offered in the 1967 treaty drafts . . . and are not consonant with the
                        times: they would compel us to sustain a significant and protracted degree
                        of control over Panamanian territory.</p>
                    <pb n="174" facs="0199" xml:id="pg_174"/>
                    <p>The instructions require a 50-year timeframe for the new treaty. . . a
                        long-term U.S. option to construct a sea-level canal or additional locks
                        unilaterally . . . and an additional treaty duration of 30–50 years if we
                        decide to expand it. <hi rend="italic">It was proven impossible in 1972 to
                            negotiate a treaty based on that guidance.</hi></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> IS NOW
                            DEVISING FORMULAE WHICH PANAMA MIGHT ACCEPT AND THE UNITED STATES MIGHT
                            LIVE WITH. WE WILL BE SENDING THE PRESIDENT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
                            SOON.</hi> We hope Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName> will join in them, but he may not, at least
                        fully.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Timing</p>
                    <p>If we can cope with the two difficult issues, it may be possible to have a
                        complete package of conceptual agreements—that is, the configuration of a
                        new treaty—by, say, April. If the President and <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> then indicated that the
                        Negotiators should proceed, a final document could possibly be prepared in a
                        month. That should allow time to seek ratification before the treaty could
                        become an issue in the presidential campaign. <hi rend="italic">DOES THE
                            PRESIDENT HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROXIMATE TIMETABLE?</hi></p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Educating the Congress and the Public</p>
                    <p>Strong Administration support will be required to secure ratification . . .
                        although the new Congress may be more sympathetic than its predecessor to a
                        new relationship with Panama.</p>
                    <p>Congressional treaty opponents, while more vocal than vote-powerful, have
                        thus far remained virtually unchallenged because we have wished to avoid
                        causing a premature public debate. Now that a treaty seems possible, however
                            <hi rend="italic">WE HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL AGREE THAT WE BEGIN A
                            LOW-KEY EFFORT TO GENERATE SUPPORT FOR IT.</hi></p>
                    <p>The effort would include:</p>
                    <p>—meetings between senior Administration officials and groups of key
                        congressmen, following consultation with the leadership on both sides;</p>
                    <p>—the establishment of a Citizen’s Committee; and</p>
                    <p>—a carefully orchestrated program to reach the media and private-interest
                        groups throughout the nation, and thereby influence the Congress.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Defense Department Assistance</p>
                    <p>Throughout the negotiations <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has
                        coordinated closely with Defense and the Joint Chiefs.<note n="5"

                        unrelated to the US presentations, with the opposing positions far apart.
                        The Panamanian position on Compensation, for example, would result in
                        payment to Panama by the US of several hundred millions of dollars. The US
                        position, based upon tonnage transiting the Canal, envisions payment of
                        $35.7 million annually. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> emphasized that the US will stick with this

                        have gone well, affording a better mutual understanding of the opposing
                        positions and the requirements of each side. Panama had omitted activities
                        requiring use of <pb n="184" facs="0209" xml:id="pg_184"/>lands to which
                        they had previously agreed. There was no negotiating during these talks.
                        Negotiations in this regard will resume in late February after Ambassador

                        leaving only the issues of Duration and Expansion to be subsequently

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> emphasized his
                        particular interest in land use, expressing pleasure at the constructive
                        nature of the technical talks and at the fact that we had enlarged
                        Panamanian understanding of US land requirements. He noted that the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff are especially concerned about US land requirements, as is
                        the entire Department of Defense.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated that it will
                        be necessary to have more negotiating flexibility than current Presidential
                        Guidance provides with respect to Duration and Expansion. During 1967
                        negotiations the US offered thirty years for treaty duration. The fifty
                        years now prescribed in Presidential Guidance thus will not be at all
                        acceptable to Panama. For Canal Expansion the US needs a definitive option
                        of twenty-five years to construct a third set of locks or a sea level canal;
                        or, alternatively, a specified period of time with first refusal rights. An
                        example of the flexibility which the US Negotiators seek is authority to
                        bargain for a shorter duration for Canal operation with a longer duration
                        for Canal defense. In return we would expect Panama to enter into a separate
                        agreement providing the Canal’s US civilian employees the same rights and
                        privileges as military personnel will have under the <gloss

                        concern of Deputy Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> and Secretary of the Army <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> that the duration guideline of 50
                        years not be scaled back. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> responded that, in his judgment, if we insist on 50
                        years there will be no treaty, but that, in any case he would stick with the
                        guidance that the President ultimately provides. He indicated that Panama
                        would probably propose the end of this century as a termination date, and
                        that we might be able to get a longer period for defense. He pointed out
                        that there is agreement with Panama that the US will participate in
                        post-treaty protection of the Canal.</p>

                        as to Department of Defense interest in the project. He pointed out risks
                        involved; i.e., the study could be helpful or otherwise, but, in any case,
                        A. D. Little, Inc. could be relied upon for objectivity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> responded that he was
                        not persuaded of the utility of the proposed study, citing the following
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>—There is broadly based political interest and technical knowledge with
                        respect to the Canal in the Senate and among other politicians in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>—The players in the ratification process understand the issues to such a
                        degree that they would not be attracted to a study.</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> has a modest amount of funds for
                        contract studies, most of which is already committed; thus <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DoD</gloss> is financially strapped.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> commented that he
                        was fairly neutral about the study, but that he thought that an
                        authoritative, objective study would be useful for the Congress. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_JAA_1">Jordan</persName> noted that its results
                        could be used either for or against the treaty. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> replied that he understood the
                        risks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> observed that,
                        if each side could use the study, the degree to which it was “authoritative”
                        was questionable. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        agreed and stated that he would not pursue the project further.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> queried Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> concerning his sensing of
                        Congressional attitudes concerning a new treaty. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> responded that Congressman <persName

                            corresp="#p_SLK_1">Sullivan</persName> were circulating a House

                        He stated that at this point he is purposely staying away from Congress.
                        Major General <persName corresp="#p_WG_1">Wallace</persName> observed that
                        32 of 35 Senators who supported Senator <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thur<pb

                        year ago are still in the Senate. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> stated that, of the 32, 18 were “hardliners” with the
                        remainder susceptible to persuasion. He acknowledged that ratification of
                        any Canal treaty would involve an uphill fight, and that, without a major
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Administration effort,
                        ratification was unlikely. He observed that BG <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> would rather have a draft treaty without
                        ratification than no treaty at all, pointing out that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> in a recent interview had
                        expressed the hope that there would be a treaty in 1975, but had emphasized
                        that getting a modernized treaty was important whether this occurred in
                        1975, or in three years or ten years.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s opening remarks
                        were substantially as contained in the enclosure.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2"
                            >An undated paper entitled “Suggested Remarks for Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s Meeting with Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff” is attached but not printed.</note> He remarked that he has
                        presented no position to the Panamanian negotiators that had not been
                        cleared in advance with the Department of Defense.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                        >Bunker</persName>’s opening remarks, General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1"
                            >Brown</persName> asked what the United States would get in exchange for
                        agreement to a treaty of shorter duration. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> responded that the guidance change
                        is critical and that there would be no treaty without a lesser term than now
                        authorized by the President.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the land use question, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> said that further work was required but that he was
                        hopeful that some mutually acceptable formula that will give the total
                        substance of control while disguising the outline of the United States
                        presence could be reached. He observed that recent discussions showed that
                        the Panamanian land use position presented in January had omitted lands
                        associated with the so-called “other activities.”</p>
                    <p>On the question of expansion, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> anticipated agreement on the basis of a definitive
                        option of short duration in combination with a right of first refusal for a
                        longer period.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> said that the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff had recently recommended the inactivation of <gloss
                            target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1">SOUTHCOM</gloss> with establishment of a small
                        residual element for security assistance and related matters. He mentioned
                        that he disagreed slightly with the Service Chiefs over the details of
                        establishing this element. He stressed a concern of his, which he said is
                        shared by Vice President Rockefeller, to avoid action which would create the
                        impression in Latin America of a lessening U.S. interest in the area. In
                        this sense, he stressed the value of continuing the existing military
                        schools which are now located in the Canal Zone. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> also commented about the significant
                        manpower savings, reduction in numbers of general officer spaces, and
                        lowered profile associated with the disestablishment and the various
                        alternative plans being considered for discharge of the residual
                        functions.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> responded to General
                        Jones’ question concerning the congressional mood by acknowledging that we
                        face a tough fight. He said the new Congress is an unknown and that there is
                        no constituency favoring a treaty. However, with the backing of the
                        President and the State and Defense Departments he was optimistic that we
                        could move the treaty forward. In any event, he observed that Panama has
                        said that it would rather have a treaty that sits than no <pb n="188"
                            facs="0213" xml:id="pg_188"/>treaty—that such a situation would show the
                        Administration’s good will.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stressed, in
                        response to General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>’s query
                        about company employees in the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>, that
                        he would insist upon equal rights.</p>
                    <p>General Weyand observed that Governor <persName corresp="#p_PDS_1"
                            >Parker</persName> in recent conversation with him shared Amb. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s view that it is now or never for a
                        treaty. He quoted General <persName corresp="#p_PDS_1">Parker</persName> as
                        saying that Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> needs
                        flexibility, that Panama has a real interest in seeing the Canal operated
                        effectively, and that the duration of our right to operate the canal is less
                        important than that for the canal’s defense. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> agreed.</p>
                    <p>General Weyand asked Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KHLT_1">Koren</persName> for
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName>’s views. He said
                        that the Secretary would stand by any decision of the President but that he
                        would favor a treaty duration for as long as possible. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> observed that a shorter duration
                        works against the likelihood of Senate ratification.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Bagley asked why Panama would want a 30 rather than 50 year treaty.
                        Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> responded that we offered
                        them a 30 year treaty in 1967 and that we would like a residual presence
                        after treaty expiration. General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1"
                            >Brown</persName> concluded by observing that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        are concerned with the security of the United States, not Panama, and that
                        they would be weighing Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s
                        views carefully in considering the issues involved in the proposed guidance
                        change. He remarked that since they would be expected to help support a
                        treaty before the Congress they would want to see a treaty supportive of our
                        security.</p>

                    <p>(U) This memorandum provides Department of Defense comments on the Memorandum
                        for the President from the Secretary of State on the above subject.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">See <ref target="#d65">Document
                        65</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>(S) The Defense Department concurs in the recommendation in the Memorandum
                        for the President, provided the proposed National Security Decision
                        Memorandum (<gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss>) stipulates a minimum
                        duration period of 50 years for Canal defense.</p>
                    <p>(S) The security interests of the United States require a military presence
                        on the Isthmus of Panama for the longest possible time because:</p>
                    <p>—The need for the Canal to assure inter-ocean passage for US Navy and other
                        US Government vessels to support strategic war plans has not diminished nor
                        can a diminution of this requirement be forecast.</p>
                    <p>—Panama’s long history of political instability suggests a long-term duration
                        formula for Canal defense to safeguard our national interest in that
                        area.</p>
                    <p>—Soviet and Cuban interests in the Hemisphere pose potential security
                        problems for Panama and the Canal.</p>
                    <p>(S) The Department of Defense recognizes the need of the US Negotiator for
                        flexibility on duration to reach agreement on other major issues, and
                        ultimately to obtain a treaty; appreciates the Panamanian sensitivity to
                        this topic; and understands the risk of a confrontation with Panama, should
                        negotiations fail or falter at this time. There is serious concern within
                        the Department that a reduction below 50 years of the duration for defense
                        of the Canal would encounter strong Congressional opposition. Therefore,
                        this Department considers that the period of treaty duration for Canal
                        defense should not be less than 50 <pb n="190" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_190"
                        />years, and that existing Presidential guidance on this point should remain
                        as cited in <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 131 (13 September 1971).

                    <p>(S) It is urged that any concession on duration of Canal operation, as
                        distinguished from Canal defense, be accompanied by major concessions by
                        Panama on compensation, lands and waters, and Status of Forces Agreement
                        coverage for Canal Administration US citizen employees.</p>
                    <p>(S) The Department endorses the objective set forth in the draft <gloss

                        military presence.</p>

                        proposals presented on Canal expansion provide the necessary flexibility to

                    <p>In our position as Presidents of Colombia, Costa Rica and Venezuela, meeting
                        with the Head of the Government of Panamá, in the Capital of this Republic,
                        we have the pleasure of fowarding to you a copy of the Joint Declaration
                        that we have signed in this historic site, where 149 years ago the Congress
                        convened by the Liberator Simon Bolivar took place.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d70fn2">A reference to the Congress of Panama, held in 1826 with
                            the goal of promoting unity among the new Latin American
                            republics.</note></p>
                    <p>As the representatives of countries traditionally friendly towards the United
                        States, engaged in the same struggles for freedom, international justice,
                        and true democracy for our peoples, we have considered it our duty to relay
                        to you, confidentially, some reflexions connected with one of the problems
                        that causes the greatest concern to the Latinamerican community. We are
                        referring to the negociations iniciated eleven years ago, on the question of
                        the Panama Canal, which is unanimously considered by the peoples and
                        governments of this Hemisphere as a matter of common interest for all of
                        Latin America.</p>
                    <p>We believe, Mr. President, that the most appropriate means of solving the
                        dispute over the jurisdictional attributions of a foreign power on
                        Panamanian territory, are the direct negociations promoted by the Council of
                        the Organization of American States through the signature of the Joint
                        Declaration by the two countries in Washington <pb n="193" facs="0218"

                    <p>We are extremely pleased by the progress made in the negociations since the
                        Secretary of State of the United States, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Henry Kissinger</persName>, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
                        Panama, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Juan Antonio Tack</persName>,
                        signed the Eight Point Declaration on the seventh of February of 1974,<note

                        in the City of Panama. However, in our conversations we have noticed the
                        deep concern felt by the Head of the Government and the other
                        representatives of the sister Republic, over the obstacles, not
                        insurmountable in our judgement, which they have encountered in trying to
                        reach an agreement over two vital problems for the future of the Panamanian
                        nation: the duration of the new treaty and the overwhelming military
                        presence of the United States in Panamanian territory.</p>
                    <p>The Government of Panama hopes to agree on a fixed term for the duration of
                        the new treaty which will put an end, in unequivocal terms, to the unlimited
                        concession over the Canal established by the Treaty of 1903 between the
                        United States and Panama. This term should not extend beyond December 31 of
                        1994. The Government of the United States, on the other hand, has demanded a
                        longer term, originally fixed at a minimum of fifty years, a time lapse not
                        in agreement with the trends of the times.</p>
                    <p>As regards the jurisdiction over the Canal Zone, we are extremely pleased by
                        the fact that the two countries have reached an agreement whereby Panama
                        will recover, as territorial sovereign, jurisdiction over all her
                        geografical extension between the Republic of Colombia and the Republic of
                        Costa Rica, within a period of three years from the day the new treaty comes
                        into effect.</p>
                    <p>This agreement reflects Point 3 of the <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        Declaration which states, “The termination of the jurisdiction of the United
                        States over Panamanian territory is to be realized promptly”.</p>
                    <p>Evidently difficulties arise in connection with the duration of the right
                        which Panama, in her condition as territorial sovereign, would grant to the
                        United States, to use the land, waters and air space which are necessary for
                        the working, maintenance, protection and defense of the Canal, as well as
                        the right of way of vessels, as indicated in Point 4 of the Eight Point
                        Declaration.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that a long period of negociations and an unduly long
                        lease, that could be considered excessive, would mean a frustration for the
                        well grounded expectations of justice of our peoples. <pb n="194"
                            facs="0219" xml:id="pg_194"/>Such an outcome would in no way benefit the
                        friendly relations among the nations that share the geography of this
                        Continent.</p>
                    <p>It should be borne in mind that the successful operation of the waterway
                        depends on a large majority of Panamanian employees who work, day and night,
                        to keep the Canal open to world traffic; and that there is no record of a
                        hostile act, from any of the Panamanians who for generations have worked
                        there.</p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, an undisputed fact that Panama, as sovereign of the
                        territory where the waterway is located, not only is the country which is
                        most interested in the security, maintenance and effectiveness of the Canal
                        that joins the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but also the one that is in the
                        best position to undertake such responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, we address ourselves to you as Head of the
                        Government of the United States, invested with the power to make
                        international treaties, to request your good will, in order that the United
                        States could work towards an arrangement whereby the duration of the new
                        treaty will not extend beyond the end of this century. We therefore hope
                        that as far as the administration, the upkeep and the protection of the
                        waterway is concerned, there will be increased Panamanian participation
                        until the final expiration of the said treaty.</p>
                    <p>We dare to assure you, Mr. President, that a formula which fills these
                        requirements would open the way for the intensification of mutual
                        cooperation between your country and Latin America.</p>
                    <p>The military presence of American forces in Panamanian territory, although
                        considered necessary by the American Government, is one of the main causes
                        of friction between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>While the American Government believes that the Canal should continue to be
                        defended by the United States for a long period, there is no doubt that in
                        this nuclear age the defense of the Canal from Panamanian soil is, by all
                        standards, inadequate. This fact has lead the government of Panama to the
                        conclusion that the American Government keeps military installations inside
                        the Canal Zone that bear no relation whatsoever with the security and
                        protection of the Canal, giving Panama the character of a colonial outpost
                        in which the whole country is subordinated to the exclusive military
                        interests of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that the people of Panama have well founded hopes that the
                        new treaty will represent a radical change in the existing situation. This
                        will not be appreciated as long as the United States maintains an
                        overwhelming military presence in the crowded urban centers of Panama and
                        Colon, endpoints of the inter-oceanic waterway.</p>
                    <pb n="195" facs="0220" xml:id="pg_195"/>
                    <p>It is obvious that if the government of the United States insists in
                        maintaining the existing situation, this position would create a serious
                        problem of unpredictable political consequences for the Government of
                        Panama, and may even lead to threats of public unrest and threats against
                        the security of the Canal itself.</p>
                    <p>We address ourselves to the fairness and the spirit of justice of the people
                        and the government of the United States, so that they give their agreement
                        to remove the fourteen military bases which are kept at present in the areas
                        surrounding the cities of Panama and Colon, within the so-called Canal Zone.
                        This would not imply in any way that the two countries could not consider
                        the establishment of military bases for the defense and protection of the
                        Canal, in areas under Panamanian jurisdiction, distant from the urban
                        centers of Panama and Colon. These would be subject to a special regime of
                        limited duration, and would entail cooperation with the armed forces of the
                        Republic of Panama.</p>
                    <p>In the coming year of 1976, two historic events which are closely tied with
                        the ideals of justice and freedom of our peoples will be celebrated. They
                        are the bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence of the United States
                        of America which will be celebrated on the fourth of July, and the 150 years
                        of the celebration of the Congress of Panama summoned by Bolivar, which will
                        take place on the 22nd of June. This would be the proper occasion for
                        reviving the philosophy of the men who laid the foundations for the Union of
                        North America and those who gave birth to the Republics of Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>We relay to you our concerns, Mr. President, moved by the sincere spirit of
                        friendship towards the people and the government of the United States, and
                        by the brotherly feeling which links us to the Panamanian Nation.</p>
                    <p>The solution which we suggest, as stated by the Secretary General of the

                    <p>Concluding a treaty hinges on the President relaxing the instructions on two
                        issues:</p>
                    <p>—its duration</p>
                    <p>—how much land/water area we keep.</p>
                    <p>I believe that Defense is not immovable on that relaxation. Without it I will
                        have inadequate bargaining counters to reach an agreement which protects US
                        interests yet is acceptable to Panama.</p>

                    <p>My objective would be to have a treaty ready for you to sign in late June or
                        early July.</p>
                    <p>Delay beyond that in delivering it to the President for submission to the
                        Congress would seem inadvisable. Growing election-campaign concerns will
                        make for increasing disinclination to address an issue such as this. The
                        treaty might have to be put over until 1977. That could lead to a situation
                        of confrontation with Panama, injurious also to our efforts in Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if a more accommodating posture toward Panama is not in
                        the cards, then we should begin moving now to minimize our certain
                        losses.</p>

                        matters.]</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How are we
                        moving the Panama negotiations? I can not get out of our negotiator what the
                        hell he wants. I know he writes me these cryptic memoranda<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d72fn2">See <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note> which
                        are what—what exactly is the decision he wants out of the President?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: He wants more flexibility—that is to say, the authority to go
                        down to really 25 years on the treaty—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. And how
                        long on defense?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: And 40 on defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would the
                        Panamanians accept that?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: He thinks so. They’ll take 25 years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And would they
                        take 40 on defense?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I don’t know, but he thinks so; and that’s the card he wants to
                        play.</p>
                    <p>The other thing is with respect to the second Canal option. The initial
                        instructions required them to leave that option open for—I’ve forgotten the
                        precise number of years. He wants to be able to negotiate an option which
                        only goes for a couple of years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Two years?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Yes. A short period of time. We would have to make up our mind
                        whether we were going to build a second Canal within a few years.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And if we build
                        a second Canal, what does that give us?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: A second Canal.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Under the same
                        terms—under the same terms as the preceding one?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I don’t know the answer.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Or for a longer
                        period?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I don’t know the answer for you.</p>
                    <pb n="199" facs="0224" xml:id="pg_199"/>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m glad you
                        gave me this answer to the first question because I was confused there for a
                        minute. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>Now, you’re going to find out for me about this interesting question?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Of the terms upon which it’s proposed to have a second Canal? I’m
                        sure.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: O.K. How can we
                        move this to a Presidential decision? There has to be a meeting. The
                        President cannot decide this without a meeting, without getting knifed in
                        the back by the Defense Department. We’ve got to have an SRG meeting first
                        to know what arguments are going to come up and then an <gloss
                            target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I thought it was all arranged. The papers have been on for both
                            meetings.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">See <ref target="#d73fn1">footnote
                                1, Document 73</ref>.</note> The papers have been before you—both
                        your Ambassador over here and your Ambassador over there. Is that right,
                        Jerry?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bremer: I saw the papers over the weekend. I’ll check on where we
                        are.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the papers
                        you’ll look in vain for a precise definition as to what he wants, except
                        more flexibility and that the terms that we are now offering are not
                        adequate. But you will look in vain in these papers for a precise definition
                        of what decision he wants from the President, except more flexibility.
                        Secondly, the question of land use, on which he also wants more flexibility
                        and on which he wants approval—he neither defines what land we are supposed
                        to give up at the edges of town. Now, what exactly is it that he wants? I
                        mean, you can’t tell—to give up land at the edges of town that is disputed
                        by the Defense Department without knowing why the Defense Department is
                        disputing it and what the hell the issue is.</p>
                    <p>The “edges of town” in Panama is not the most illustrative example, from what
                        I’ve seen of Panama. (Laughter.) That probably means in the Canal Zone. Can
                        it mean anything else? We don’t have any land anywhere else.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So does he mean
                        at the edge of Panama City?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Yes. We can show you with great precision on a map.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t want to
                        see it on a map. I want to have a decision that the President can make. You
                        can’t expect the President, who is going to be killed in the Congress with
                        this, to give blanket authority to give up land at the edges of town without
                        knowing why it is that the Defense Department opposes it.</p>
                    <pb n="200" facs="0225" xml:id="pg_200"/>
                    <p>Jerry, will you please line up an SRG meeting as soon as possible and then an
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting? He will never get
                        authority the way he’s proceeding. I won’t give him authority. What he wants
                        is to be sent down there with a carte blanche to come back with a treaty.
                        Even that he can get if he puts it in a manner that the President can
                        understand.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Does General
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> have the capability to
                        carry out sustained terrorist attacks on U.S. installations and personnel
                        (if the Senate refuses to ratify the treaty)?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Colby: Yes, he has the capability. What would happen is that he would
                        benefit from the nationalistic feelings that would be unleashed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Terrorist
                        attacks inside the Canal Zone? Do you agree, George (Gen. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>)?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Colby: The problem is that there are a lot of vulnerable things there,
                        machinery and stuff.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. In
                        addition, you’d have the Latin American problem, which would be a mess.
                        Okay. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> (Amb. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>), could you give us a rundown on
                        where the negotiations are at this point and what you are trying to do?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: What we are trying to do
                        is to obtain a treaty which would preserve our national security interests
                        and at the same time be salable to both Panama and to our own Congress. In
                        spite of Congressional criticism, I think that the package we have put
                        together so far would protect our security interests. The problem is that we
                        can’t get a treaty if we have to stick to our earlier instructions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has made it quite
                        clear that he will not accept a 50-year treaty duration. They want something
                        less than that. If you will recall, in 1967–1968 we offered a 30-year
                        duration. They turned that down. We tried again in 1971 and 1972 with a
                        50-year duration. They turned that down. What we want to do is put together
                        a treaty that will give us optimum security but is also salable to
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would make
                        it salable to Congress? I saw where (Senator) <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName> has already lined up 37 Senators in opposition to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I think that perhaps half
                        of those 37 are persuadable.</p>
                    <pb n="202" facs="0227" xml:id="pg_202"/>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: You know, Henry, the
                        issue also involves the question of other priorities. Do you want to have a
                        flap over this issue, or save your guns for a more important issue?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, that’s
                        what the President will have to decide. He’ll have to weigh that against the
                        international consequences—where we would be years from now without a
                        treaty. What happens after twenty-five years as far as defense of the canal
                        is concerned?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Well, we’re asking for a
                        twenty-five to fifty year defense duration in the treaty. We also hope to be
                        able to negotiate some type of military presence there after the expiration
                        of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What’s the
                        problem then?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Well, the question is,
                        can Defense accept 20 years’ duration on canal operations and 25 years on
                        defense? What we are asking for is some flexibility. What we would like to
                        get is somewhere between twenty-five and fifty years’ duration on
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you
                        think would be realistically acceptable to Congress?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I would hope that
                        Congress would accept somewhere between thirty-five and fifty years’
                        duration on defense. Say forty years, for example.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would the
                        Defense Department fall on its sword over ten-years on duration? What
                        happens after forty years, for example? Who defends the Canal after forty
                        years?</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I think the (Armed)
                        Services would have to consider a ten-year difference very carefully, but I
                        don’t think they would fall on their swords over only a five-to-seven year
                        difference. Ten years would give us some problems.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: If we drop more than
                        ten years, we would have real problems.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have real
                        difficulty understanding why the Services could accept forty-three years and
                        not forty. What do you have, inside information that something is going to
                        happen then?</p>
                    <p>(General <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Scowcroft</persName> entered the meeting
                        at this point reporting that President Thieu had not left Saigon.)</p>
                    <p>I understand the lower cut-off point, but not the higher.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We can talk in increments
                        of five years, but ten years would be difficult to accept.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: After X number
                        of years, what happens? Who takes over operation and defense of the
                        Canal?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Panama would take over
                        operation of the Canal. After say forty years’ duration on defense, Panama
                        would also take <pb n="203" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_203"/>over responsibility
                        for the defense of the Canal, but we would hope to be able to negotiate some
                        sort of residual presence.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Is this spelled out
                        explicitly?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the
                        treaty?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: In an agreement.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d73fn4">See <ref target="#d57">Document
                        57</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. What we
                        face here are two issues. The first one is substantive. Defense is arguing
                        that the treaty’s duration for defensive purposes must be fifty years and
                        not less than forty years. Even forty years gives them a lot of pain.
                        (Senator) <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> opposes any kind
                        of new treaty. By the way, he called me the other day and claimed that we
                        were planning to turn over a number of things like the police, the fire
                        department and postal service unilaterally to the Panamanians.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d73fn5">Record of conversation not found.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: There are no unilateral turnovers planned. Provisions in the
                        treaty relate to turning over installations to the Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then I can
                        assure <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> that there will be
                        no unilateral transfer of jurisdiction outside the treaty.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d73fn6"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> spoke

                            April 23 to assure him. (Department of State, FOIA Virtual Reading Room,

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Absolutely.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: There is no transfer of
                        jurisdiction or services outside the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, my
                        sympathy for the citizens of the Canal Zone is zero. The Canal Zone is
                        nothing more than a vestige of colonialism in my view.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: There are a number of
                        things that are irritants to them, but they are minor and I’m sure we can

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: That’s right, Henry.
                        You know, if in the President’s judgement the timing is not right to have a
                        treaty, we can make some small accommodations with the Panamanians. There’s
                        a lot of little things we could do. They are not much in terms of value, but
                        they would be symbolic.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you
                        think, Bill?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I think they are interested in a treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> does want a treaty? If
                        he does, how flexible is he? If there is no treaty, will he accept
                        unilateral accommodations to ease the pain? Do you think this is
                        manageable?</p>
                    <pb n="204" facs="0229" xml:id="pg_204"/>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I think it would be very
                        difficult for him to accept.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay, how about
                        a three-minute lecture on the land and waters issue.</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: In our negotiations, the
                        Panamanians have made it clear that they cannot accept an overwhelming U.S.
                        military presence in the Canal Zone. We propose to turn over some facilities
                        and areas to them. We should not hold on to those areas that are not
                        critical to the defense of the Canal. Some of these areas that we do not
                        plan to turn over are near the major cities, however, and they say that
                        constitutes an overwhelming presence. We would like to reach some
                        accommodation with them on that issue. <persName corresp="#p_THD_1"
                            >Train</persName> ing fields, for example, could be shared.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Could this be
                        done unilaterally if necessary?</p>
                    <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Bill, do you
                        think this will satisfy them?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: No I don’t.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that the
                        State Department and the Defense Department should get together and work out
                        what we are willing to give up and what optical changes we could make to
                        satisfy the Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Yes, isolate our
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You two (Defense
                        and State) get together and get an agreed position. I think this is a matter
                        for the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> once we see what the
                        differences are.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Colby: I think the Panamanians will want a treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think we’re
                        clear about that. As I understand it, this is really a domestic political
                        decision that the President will have to make. Many in Congress are opposed
                        to a treaty. It’s the judgement of the Intelligence Community that if the
                        treaty negotiations break down, there are going to be one hell of a lot of
                        problems. If the President decides to proceed with a treaty, he is going to
                        get one hell of a lot of flak in this country. We have to get agreement on
                        the land and waters issue. When we have that, we can present it to him for
                        decision. I think we’ll have an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> meeting
                        on this in two or three weeks. We’ll let the President make the
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Good.</p>

                        are concerned and disillusioned about the prospects of obtaining a new Canal

                            prerogatives in defense or we won’t get the treaty through the
                            Congress.” He added: “But our Congress is out of control. The condition
                            is described here as ‘Latin American’—no executive authority,” and
                            “given the present state of affairs with the Congress, they wouldn’t

                        for ratification of a new Canal treaty. Aside from their reluctance to give
                        up rights in the Canal Zone, some members of Congress are opposed to even
                        negotiating a treaty because they question the legitimacy of the present

                        <pb n="206" facs="0231" xml:id="pg_206"/>reported that despite the sentiment
                        of the Congress of the United States, the executive branch of the Government
                        of the United States is doing what it can to arrive at a reasonable and just

                        He said that the Department of State is worried about congressional concerns

                        very upset over recent statements by United States Congressmen concerning

                        interprets these statements as being part of a well conceived plan,
                        orchestrated by “Washington” to deny Panama a new treaty. <persName

                        suffered around the world which have hardened the attitude of Congress.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName> has been gauging the

                            >Lievano</persName> told a Panamanian journalist that Panama is now
                        preparing for and expects a postponement and possible discontinuation of the
                        treaty negotiations. He said that the United States may stall and attempt to
                        postpone signing a new treaty since it is doubtful that a new treaty would
                        be approved by the Senate at this time. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"

                            >Lievano</persName> that Panama’s reaction to such a tactic would be to
                        engage in world-wide denunciation of the United States. This anti-U.S.
                        campaign would be launched among Latin American countries and would be
                        followed by a request for support from the Third World nations, especially
                        the Arab bloc. The Communist nations would be asked to participate.</p>
                    <p>9. There are government employees who are currently discussing with students
                        the possibility the Canal treaty negotiations may fail for the purpose of

                        Defense have developed the enclosed series of steps which the United States
                        might consider taking in the event that agreement on a new treaty with
                        Panama is not possible. Listed actions are not limited entirely to
                        jurisdiction and lands and waters. Most would require Panamanian agreement
                        and cooperation for implementation. The few and relatively insignificant
                        measures which could be taken by Executive Branch action alone are at
                        Attachment 1. Even so, Congress should be informed of these steps before
                        they are taken. Measures requiring Congressional action are at Attachment
                        2.</p>

                    <p>SMB: I doubt the latter. The former is pretty definite—all signs we get say

                            two issues—the duration of the treaty and the duration of the Canal
                            defense arrangement. Defense will buy a 25-year treaty with a 50-year
                            defense arrangement. The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> may buy 40
                            years. If these negotiations fail, we will be beaten to death in every
                            international forum and there will be riots all over Latin America. We
                            maybe could work out the signing the end of this year, submit it to the
                            Senate with the understanding there will be no action until ’77, or not
                            submit it. Panama could then ratify it first. If it collapses we will
                            have massive problems. If you sign it you will also have massive
                            problems.” (Memorandum of conversation, May 12; Ford Library, National

                    <p>President: Bill, can you give us a briefing on the Panama Canal?</p>
                    <p>Colby: (Intelligence briefing attached at Tab D)<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2"
                            >Tab D, dated May 12, is ibid.</note></p>
                    <p>President: Thank you. Can you give us any indication of the land that is
                        involved?</p>
                    <p>Colby: One of the major issues involved is the fact that you can only land in
                        Panama at points which are subject to U.S. control. This is a matter of
                        great concern to the Panamanians. The rest is a matter of degree. But the
                        fact that they do not have direct access to Panama bothers them.</p>
                    <p>President: Henry, can you lay out the options as you see them?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, one of my
                        problems with this issue is that <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName> won’t tell me what he’s doing. So I think it would
                        be better to ask him first. And then I will add my comments.</p>
                    <p>President: Mr. Ambassador, would you please discuss this?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Mr. President, we think that a
                        treaty is within reach. But to get it we need flexibility on two issues:
                        duration and lands and waters. I have no doubt that failure in these
                        negotiations would entail unacceptable risks including negative effects
                        beyond Panama which would disrupt our relations with Latin America, lead to
                        world condemnation, and hamper the operation of the waterway. If we get into
                        a situation involving confrontation, we would turn what is now a basically
                        free country radically to the Left. While we could undoubtedly maintain our
                        control, we would deprive ourselves of what we have gained so far and
                        undermine any future possibility of a reasonable agreement. We are trying to
                        get a treaty which is acceptable both to Panama and to the Congress, and at
                        the same time protect our basic security and interests. I believe we can
                        achieve a balance of the various interests and if we do so, the treaty would
                        be acceptable to both Panama and Congress. We look at this as involving a
                        balance of many components: the long-term protection of our security
                        interests including the right to act unilaterally in defense of the Canal;
                        the consent of the host country; maintenance of our bases; satisfactory
                        conditions for Canal personnel; duration and post-treaty security
                        arrangements. Panama has already agreed to give us all the defense rights we
                        want including a good Status of Forces Agreement. We want a balance between
                        adequate control over the operation of the Canal, sufficient military
                        presence, long but not too long duration, and a reasonable assurance of
                            post-<pb n="213" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_213"/>treaty defense
                        arrangements. With this balance we can obtain a treaty which is acceptable
                        to all parties, and more real security than we have today. However, we need
                        negotiating flexibility, relaxation on treaty duration to between 20 and 50
                        years.</p>
                    <p>President: Assume a treaty of 25 to 50 years—what happens after that
                        expires?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Panama will have control of
                        the Canal. We will jointly guarantee its neutrality and access for ships of
                        all nations. What we would like to have is flexibility, particularly as
                        between duration for operation and defense. Defense has agreed with us on a
                        period of duration for operation purposes but feels we should have 50 years
                        on defense. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has made it
                        clear 50 years is unacceptable. We want flexibility so we can bargain as
                        between duration for operation and duration for defense: 25 years for
                        operation, 50 for defense, if we can get it, though I am certain we cannot.
                        Something in-between is what is necessary. And then a lands and waters
                        proposal which is sufficient to permit agreement. The present one is not
                        saleable to Panama.</p>
                    <p>President: I am not sure I understand what you mean by ‘operation.’</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: The administration of the
                        Canal.</p>
                    <p>President: Once a treaty is signed and approved, how would operation go?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: For X number of years we
                        would run it. After the treaty expires, it would go to Panama.</p>
                    <p>President: And our defense rights would go along with it?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The original concept was
                        of duration for both operation and defense for a 50-year period. Now we are
                        proposing to split the two. We would be willing to settle for a shorter
                        period for operational control if we could get a longer one for defense. I
                        have to add that in 1967 we offered them 33 years.</p>
                    <p>President: For both operation and defense?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Now, if we could get
                        25 years for operation, we would be still better off than we would have been
                        in 1967. We would probably have no great difficulty in getting them to
                        accept 25 years for operation duration. For defense they will not accept 50
                        years. We have not yet explored this with them as we have not been
                        authorized to. So we don’t know how much more than 25 but less than 50 they
                        would accept. How much longer for defense than operation has not been
                        explored. It would be less than 50 but more than 25. This is the area in
                        which the negotiations would have to take place, if you decide to permit
                        greater flexibility. The land uses matter can’t be explored here. We don’t
                        have any proposal to make, but something is possible. It seems to me the
                        basic issues are the following: first, whether you <pb n="214" facs="0239"
                            xml:id="pg_214"/>are willing to go along with the concept of separating
                        operation from defense. The agencies all agree on this approach. Though not
                        on the numbers—what is going to happen in 40 years is so hard to predict.
                        Two, if you are willing to go that route, then, what is the minimum we can
                        accept? Three, if you don’t want a treaty now, you have to decide whether
                        there are some unilateral steps we can take which ease the situation for
                        Panama—steps which give up some of the lands but do not change the
                        relationship. It is my strong impression from the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss> sessions which have just been taking place, in which I
                        talked to most of the Latin ministers,<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d76">Document 76</ref>.</note> that we will get no help
                        from them, but, on the contrary, they will not hesitate to contribute to our
                        problems. On the other hand, I have been hammered by <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> and Buckley on this and am fully
                        aware of the problems raised from that side. If you decide to go for a
                        treaty, then you have the problem of Congress. It is possible, however, that
                        if a treaty were negotiated and signed, you could hold up ratification until
                        1977. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> would go along with
                        that. Of course, the Congress will scream when a treaty is signed, even
                        before ratification. Internationally, failure to conclude a treaty is going
                        to get us into a <hi rend="italic">cause celebre</hi>, with harassment,
                        demonstrations, bombing of embassies. The next administration will face the
                        issue again with less receptivity and poorer chances to get a reasonable
                        agreement. On the other hand, if we do it now, we will face a major domestic
                        uproar.</p>
                    <p>President: Going so far as bombs here?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, not literally—just
                        political. No one here is for it. Those who are against it are extremely
                        vocal. Frankly, I can’t convince myself that the difference between 40 and
                        50 years is that important. If you decide not to go ahead with the
                        negotiations, we have to decide how to do it with a minimum of damage. There
                        will be an uproar in Panama, with riots and harassment. It will become an
                        armed camp and will spread rapidly to the Western Hemisphere. It will become
                        an <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> issue around which they will all
                        unite. Then it will spread into the international organizations. It is just
                        a question of how long you want to take. From the foreign policy point of
                        view, I favor going ahead. However, domestically I’ve already encountered
                        enough opponents to know what a barrier exists.</p>
                    <p>President: I’ve been told that 37 Senators have signed some document that
                        they would disapprove of a treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: From the foreign policy point of view, we’re better off signing a
                        treaty and not submitting it to the Senate. That would give us two
                        years.</p>
                    <pb n="215" facs="0240" xml:id="pg_215"/>
                    <p>President: I have a question. I am told that, inasmuch as we would be giving
                        up U.S. territory, both the Senate and the House would need to act on this;
                        the Senate on the treaty and the House on the land. Of course, in the House
                        a simple majority is sufficient but two-thirds are needed in the Senate.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Thirty-seven Senators signed
                        the <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1">Thurmond</persName> resolution. Our
                        analysis in the State Department indicates that perhaps 20 are soft
                        opponents and might be persuadable; 17 are intransigent and not susceptible
                        of being won over. As of now, the Canal has a constituency while the treaty
                        has none. That is because we have done nothing yet. We have made no broad
                        effort on the Hill or with the public. Consultation with the Congress and
                        public education would be essential in getting a treaty passed.</p>
                    <p>President: What do you think about this, Jim?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The details of the
                        Defense position have been discussed in the earlier meetings. I would like
                        to give you my personal observations. I guess I may be classified as an
                        opponent of the treaty. It seems to me one of the biggest mistakes the
                        United States has made since 1945 was not to acquire sovereign base rights
                        in a number of places around the world, like the Philippines and elsewhere
                        in the Far East. The Panama Canal Zone represents one of these sovereign
                        base areas. Defense agreed to the Eight Principles signed last year which
                        sacrificed sovereign land areas. It was a generous offer on the part of the
                        U.S., giving them land and sovereignty. What Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> refers to as flexibility is no less
                        than a further reduction in what we’re asking for, an erosion in our
                        position of substantial magnitude. It seems to me we’re engaged in reducing
                        our requirements to what we think <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> will accept. When I was <gloss target="#t_DCI_1"
                            >DCI</gloss>, the analysis was different. We recognize that there will
                        be harassment and attacks. The question is whether the price is worth
                        defending a set of principles on our part. Worldwide reactions are likely to
                        be mixed. When the U.S. shows strength and determination, it receives
                        respect. When it recedes from its position, it whets appetites. I was
                        reluctant to see the position your predecessor, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>, took in 1967. That eroded your
                        position.</p>
                    <p>President: Were those the negotiations <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1">Bob
                            Anderson</persName> conducted?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Yes; we have had eight
                        years since then; one solution would be to try to protect our position for
                        another eight years. That might give us the greatest period of time
                        advantage. Henry put the problem in terms of a conflict between domestic and
                        international interests. I think it’s more complex than that. The
                        international effect will be varied—the Brazilians and some of the others
                        respect us when we take a strong stand—there will be different attitudes.
                        While the international implications are mixed, the domestic are unmixed; in
                        my <pb n="216" facs="0241" xml:id="pg_216"/>mind the question is whether or
                        not the U.S. is capable of standing up to the harassment which <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> is quite capable of
                        mounting.</p>
                    <p>President: In your judgment would the harassment be of such degree that it
                        could render the Canal inoperable?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I think not. The <gloss

                        depend on their assessment of the American position. If they were persuaded
                        the U.S. was flexible, then they would be tough; if they thought the
                        American position was tough, they would be more reasonable. They will take
                        advantage of the situation depending on how firm the U.S. is prepared to be.
                        If we are tough in the Canal they will yield. In recent years the U.S. has
                        not shown a great deal of this quality.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do we want to stand
                        up for the Eight Principles for? They give no time limit and no guidance in
                        this issue.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I understood it was 50
                        years.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is in the
                        presidential instructions, but not in the principles. The principles just
                        speak of an adequate period of time. We have all agreed on proposing 25
                        years for operation; the issue is whether or not to insist on 50 for
                        defense, with an extension into the post-treaty period. My recommendation
                        would be to shave our demands on matters like operation if it could add to
                        defense. I do not share the view that some of the Latins will support us. I
                        have just finished talking to all of them and am convinced that none will
                        support us. The question is, is this a good issue on which to try to
                        face-down the Latins? It might be if it were only <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> we have to face-down, but this
                        is the whole Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>Colby: I am convinced that we are facing in the next 15 years increasing
                        tension between the North and South which will take on racial
                        characteristics. They would be unified against us.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I don’t think there is any
                        problem about Defense and State coming to some reasonable solution; working
                        out the details is easy.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: This is no problem. The
                        post-treaty conditions are a little more difficult. We could set them out
                        further in some reasonable and understandable form. So far as harassment in
                        the Canal Zone goes, this can be contained without severe action. In order
                        to do that we will have to make some minor concessions. We can move forward
                        with the lesser issues and keep the negotiations going, make some of the <pb
                            n="217" facs="0242" xml:id="pg_217"/>accommodations they want, but keep
                        the treaty out of the political arena. Joe Doaks in Paducah is excited about
                        the Panama Canal. He considers this part of his business and will become
                        very emotional about it. I know I’m supposed to be a non-partisan career
                        official, but I can tell you this will be one hell of an issue domestically
                        in 1976. I think we can avoid it by making some accommodations, working out
                        the details, and holding everything as it is for 18 months, and still save
                        to a reasonable degree the international conditions.</p>
                    <p>President: Would these adjustments fit under a subsequent treaty?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with Bill that we
                        could come to an agreement with Defense on all points in a treaty, and we
                        would gain internationally. From the foreign policy point of view this is
                        just not a good issue to face people down with. With regard to his
                        recommendation that we protract the negotiations so as not to sign for 18
                        months, we’ll have to take a look to see if it’s possible.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHH_1">Bo Callaway</persName> and the Army assure me this
                        can be done. We’ll have to do some selling, but there are a lot of things
                        that we can do, and we feel very positive about it.</p>
                    <p>President: I’ve had some experience with the Panama Canal, going back as
                        early as 1951 when I was a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee
                        that had jurisdiction over the Panama Canal. At that time I had the temerity
                        to look at the sinecures that some of the civilian employees of the Canal
                        had acquired, such as rents, which I think were $15 a month, and a raft of
                        other gratuities that few other people working for the Federal Government
                        received. I objected and sought to decrease these benefits. I was met with
                        an onslaught from a highly organized group which I hadn’t anticipated.
                        Previous to that, the Carrier on which I served went through the Canal. A
                        Navy Canal pilot whom I met took me back to the other side and we stayed out
                        late having what I remember were called “blue moons.” The ship was going to
                        San Diego the next morning. At about 2:00 a.m., I asked whether we shouldn’t
                        start back. He said, “Never mind, I’ll fly you in the morning.” And so we
                        went to sleep at about 2:00 and at 5:00, took off in a single engine plane;
                        we went through the worst rainstorm I ever saw. I got on the gangplank of
                        the ship just as it was beginning to go up. If I had missed it I would have
                        been AWOL. But that is the most highly organized group of American employees
                        I know. They have a vested interest in the status quo. This is a group that
                        gives the public the impression of what we should be doing down there. We
                        are not going to decide this issue on those grounds. They ought to know it.
                        The Army gets its information from them and they infect it with their views.
                        But they’re not going to decide this.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHH_1">Bo Callaway</persName> and the Army have been
                        handling this very effectively. They have been attempting to bring about a
                        reduction in these benefits.</p>
                    <pb n="218" facs="0243" xml:id="pg_218"/>
                    <p>President: Do they still get a 20 to 25% wage differential?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I think they get some. The
                        Army and Bo want to do things right. They want to bring the Panamanians into
                        the operation and do some other things that should have happened long
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>President: This group of Americans go from one generation to another. Some of
                        them have been there for three generations.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: These concessions could
                        take two forms—first, they could help save our lives on the treaty; second,
                        if the Panamanians perceive them as a substitute for a treaty, we will have
                        difficulty. We will have to look into the possibility of whether we can drag
                        the negotiations out until after the elections. For that kind of thing we
                        can probably get some Latin American support from people like the
                        Brazilians.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: What <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHH_1">Bo Callaway</persName> is talking about is a number
                        of atmospherics. He is the most ardent advocate of the Eight Principles and
                        the existing presidential guidance.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Eight Principles are
                        just platitudes, deliberately designed to be satisfactory to both sides.
                        They give no guidance on this.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The Army is prepared to
                        accept them. Bo and the others firmly adhere to this position. It’s our
                        position that the little flexibility they’re asking would reduce the period
                        to 30 or 25 years and soon it gets down to the point which we just can’t
                        tolerate—20 years, for instance.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, that’s not the case;
                        we’re trying to separate operational rights from defense rights. For
                        operational rights we’re willing to accept down to 20 years; for defense
                        rights not 50 but more than 25, something like 30 or 40—my own estimate is
                        we should get 40 or even 45—that means defense by Americans. We haven’t
                        tried shaving the other treaty rights to get more on defense rights.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: And some post-treaty
                        rights.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In any circumstances the
                        defense control will extend well beyond the year 2000.</p>
                    <p>President: Are you saying that if the treaty is signed, our sovereign rights
                        will extend through the year 2000?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Until 2000 we operate the
                        Canal and until, say, 40 years, that is until the year 2015, we have the
                        unilateral right to defend the Canal. Then there is the problem of the
                        post-treaty rights which we’ve not been prepared to discuss. My
                        understanding is that sovereignty would lapse with the signing of the
                        agreement and be phased out over a three-year period. The operational part
                        is less important than defense.</p>
                    <p>President: Then there are really three points. Sovereignty is phased out in 3
                        years, operation would be 25, and defense rights 40 to 45.</p>

                    <p>(The Vice President enters)</p>
                    <p>Rumsfeld: I’ve been doing some talking up on the Hill and I find there is a
                        great deal of distrust and concern and leaking of documents to the Hill by
                        the people in the Zone. I would caution against any new treaty concession
                        being made to the Panamanians. The conservatives would join with the
                        liberals on this.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is a totally separate
                        issue. There is a story on the Hill that we are negotiating some unilateral
                            accommodations.<note n="5" xml:id="d77fn5">See <ref target="#d73"
                                >Document 73</ref>.</note> This is sheer nonsense. We have told them
                        that. We should save these unilateral concessions for the treaty where we
                        get something in return.</p>
                    <p>Rumsfeld: There is a strong constituency in Panama and there is not at home.
                        We don’t think this is a matter of deep concern among the American people,
                        but there is a violent concern among some Congressmen that have active
                        supporters opposing this treaty.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Is it a matter of
                        physical harassment?</p>
                    <p>Rumsfeld: No—political. Some of our good friends in the Congress feel very
                        strongly about this issue. If we antagonize them on this, then the ability
                        of the President to deal with other matters of high priority, like Turkey,
                        will be diminished. The point is that this so angers people on the Hill that
                        we lose their support. This will affect the attitude of these people with
                        regard to other issues. It would be just like sending up a nomination for
                            <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Abe Fortas</persName>.<note n="6"

                        persuade some of these people.</p>
                    <p>Vice President: I am a politician and I know a little about pursuing our
                        national interests and the treatment of people. I understand these people
                        that Don talks about—they have to understand the world in which we live.
                        This is a big issue in Latin America like the expropriation of oil in Mexico
                        was in 1939. It’s symbolic of freedom from the United States and the
                        restoration of dignity. This is terribly important for our relations in the
                        Western Hemisphere. I would like to talk to some of these people. I may be
                        able to help.</p>
                    <p>Colby: The pressure will grow from Latin America. There is a tendency to
                        compare it with the base at Guantanamo. The situation is going to get more
                        and more tense.</p>
                    <p>President: What is the time schedule as you see it?</p>
                    <pb n="220" facs="0245" xml:id="pg_220"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: If we can get the flexibility
                        we need, and without it we can’t get a treaty, then we can move along and
                        probably get something by August or September. There has been no treaty
                        drafting as yet.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: We have done no selling on
                        the Hill because we didn’t know our position, and couldn’t explain it. This
                        problem is not going to go away. It’s going to get worse.</p>
                    <p>President: We ought to get further information on the proposal of the
                        specific things which <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Bo Callaway</persName> is
                        talking about. When we see those specifics we can look at how much can be
                        done unilaterally and how soon. They should be put together soon; let me
                        look to see what impact they would have and after that we’ll take a look at
                        what we can do.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The fundamental problem is
                        to assure that we maintain the negotiating position. If <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> perceives that we’ve abandoned
                        it in some way, he wouldn’t want to play that game and we would be in for a
                        confrontation. If we used these unilateral steps to protect our negotiations
                        for 18 months, we might be all right and some of the more sophisticated
                        Latins like the Brazilians might help. But if we say there will be no new
                        treaty, then there will be an uproar. (I’ve never discussed this with the
                        Vice President so I can assure you there’s been no collusion.) We would have
                        a real uproar; volunteers, demonstrations, violence, and we would be dragged
                        into every international forum. This is no issue to face the world on. It
                        looks like pure colonialism.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The palliatives will
                        help us only as far as postponement is concerned. Sooner or later we’re
                        going to run into these problems. You must face the prospect of
                        harassment.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_CHH_1">Bo Callaway</persName> and the Joint Chiefs and all
                        of us are together on this. There is no problem. We want to move forward.
                        We’re not advocating the status quo. We understand that a treaty is
                        inevitable; the problem is timing.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll have to draw up a
                        list and then make our best assessment of the situation if we are to protect
                        the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>President: Let’s find out what the alleged goodies are and the impact of this
                        kind of thing.</p>
                    <p>Vice President: Do you know <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                        >Torrijos</persName>? He’s a very interesting guy. I think at some point if

                        personal attention. It would have a big impact.</p>
                    <p>Rumsfeld: Get him with . . .</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Right now he’s working on

                    <p>President: We ought to expose him to my old friend <persName

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’d complete the

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> staff has decided not to issue any
                        guidance to Defense or State as a result of the meeting with the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>Rather, Defense is to take the initiative in putting forward a proposal
                        whereby (a) unilateral actions would be employed to relieve pressures while
                        (b) negotiations are stretched out as a prelude to (c) a delay in submitting
                        the treaty for ratification until early 1977.<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>This exercise is apparently underway, but no due-date has been fixed. There
                        are reports that Action Officers in the Defense Department have been told to
                        “take their time” about it.</p>
                    <p>The Negotiators will wait to see what, if anything, emerges from Defense in
                        the coming days. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, who have talked several
                        times, have agreed to talk again upon <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>’s return to the Department Wednesday morning from a
                        Seattle-Vermont trip. (I return to Washington this Friday evening from the
                        Seattle trip).<note n="3" xml:id="d78fn3">While <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName> was in Seattle, he addressed the Rainier Club on

                    <p>But we are already prepared to counter the Defense proposal. Our position
                        would run generally along the lines of the attached draft—which it would be
                        useful for you to read as background, although I <pb n="222" facs="0247"
                            xml:id="pg_222"/>am revising it to “stretch out” the negotiation
                        somewhat further and to identify an outer-limit to the stretch-out.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d78fn4">A draft paper, undated, entitled “U.S-Panama
                            Treaty Negotiations,” is attached but not printed. In the draft, Bell
                            wrote: “They [unilateral actions] would prevent neither confrontation
                            nor censure. And if they could be moved through the Congress, which is
                            doubtful, they would rob future negotiators of the best bargaining
                            chips. Conclusion of a treaty seems possible if the President relaxes
                            sufficiently the negotiation instructions.”</note></p>
                    <p>One probable problem with the Defense proposal is that it will come down for
                        unilateral actions and stretched-out negotiations, yet will not offer what
                        will make <hi rend="italic">any</hi> negotiations—stretched-out or
                        not—possible: a relaxation of the guidance. We believe it is more and more
                        clear that Defense will have to be ordered by the President to “give” on
                        lands and on duration, despite what <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> said at the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>This panorama has been complicated by what the Secretary mentioned to

                        now. I believe they will read the Secretary’s query, correctly or not, as a
                        strong indication that he wishes he could escape from the negotiation. (I
                        have briefed <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Bill Jorden</persName>, by secure

                        conversation, so that he can be alert to reactions.)</p>
                    <p>A further complication is that <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> reportedly spread the word to senior Defense

                    <p>The Negotiators have no background on any such agreement.</p>

                    <p>—our position vis-à-vis the Panamanians is becoming more tenuous as the

                    </list>
                    <p>This memorandum is a follow-up to the recent <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> discussion of measures which may permit the United States
                        to meet its commitment concerning a new Panama Canal Treaty without
                        incurring unacceptable domestic political costs.</p>
                    <p>While I am convinced that it is in the interest of the United States to
                        continue to negotiate for a new Panama Canal Treaty in accordance with the
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> agreement of February 1974, I am
                        equally convinced that to attempt to achieve a new treaty before the 1976
                        Presidential election would be both impractical and politically damaging. In
                        order both to spin out the negotiations and to avoid a serious
                        confrontation, I believe that we should embark on a series of steps designed
                        to create a sense of momentum toward a mutually satisfactory treaty
                        relationship; to this end, I suggest the following actions:</p>
                    <p>1. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> should invite the
                        Panamanian Chief of Government, Brigadier General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, to visit Washington and the
                        United States. During this visit, President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName> would</p>
                    <pb n="224" facs="0249" xml:id="pg_224"/>
                    <p>—Explain in complete candor the political problem which would result if the
                        Administration were to confront the Congress in a treaty ratification fight
                        before the election.</p>
                    <p>—Convince Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        of the good faith of the United States Government in continuing steadfastly
                        to pursue the objective of a new treaty despite significant Congressional
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>—Establish a target date of early 1977 for initialling the new treaty and
                        initiating ratification procedures in both countries.</p>
                    <p>—Convince Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        of the futility of violent Panamanian reaction to this delay in achieving a
                        treaty, since such a reaction would clearly preclude treaty ratification for
                        many years.</p>
                    <p>—Propose to Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> the actions enumerated in the following
                        paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>2. Propose a differential duration concept, with a treaty duration of no less
                        than 25 years for Canal operation, and between 40 and 50 years for Canal
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>—Panama has stated that it cannot accept a 50 year treaty duration while the
                        United States is currently committed to a minimum of 50 years’ duration.</p>
                    <p>—The United States and Panama should both compromise on this issue, as
                        described above.</p>
                    <p>3. Propose that, consistent with the current U.S. concept for the defense of
                        the Canal against external aggression, Panama participate in that defense
                        and share designated training areas.</p>
                    <p>—To facilitate implementation of this shared responsibility, a U.S.-Panama
                        Combined Canal Defense Board should be established.</p>
                    <p>—The Combined Defense Board would make appropriate recommendations to the
                        senior United States and Panamanian military commanders having
                        responsibility for local Canal defense.</p>
                    <p>4. Propose that Panama and the United States agree conceptually upon a
                        bilateral mutual assistance arrangement for post-treaty Canal defense.</p>
                    <p>5. Propose that, between now and early 1977, the U.S. should unilaterally
                        take a series of steps which meet some of Panama’s aspirations for gaining
                        control of Canal-associated activities, while reducing somewhat the U.S.
                        involvement in them.</p>
                    <p>—Unilateral actions envisioned include only those which the Executive Branch
                        could take without Congressional action.</p>
                    <p>—List of actions is at Tab A.<note n="2" xml:id="d79fn2">Tab A, entitled
                            “Unilateral Actions (Require No Congressional Action),” undated, is
                            attached but not printed. Among the proposed unilateral actions were:
                            using Panamanian license plates on Canal Zone privately-owned vehicles;
                            consolidating and reducing the <gloss target="#t_SOUTHCOM_1"
                                >SOUTHCOM</gloss> structure; leasing lands to Panama; and increasing
                            the utilization of Panamanian employees in the Canal Zone work
                            force.</note></p>
                    <pb n="225" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_225"/>
                    <p>6. Attempt to increase Panama’s revenues from the Canal, either by
                        authorizing for Panama funds derived from increasing tolls, or by
                        appropriating funds for this purpose. (NOTE: Legislative action would be
                        necessary.)</p>

                    <p>[Mr. Rogers:] Also, on Panama, you’re aware that <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName> feels that he would like to get back before the
                        end of the month. He’s under significant pressure from <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, who was saying that his time is
                        running out.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we better
                        decide what we’re going to do.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: That’s the basic issue—whether or not aid to a country initially
                        soon or so can be done at first, and then an amendment on instructions.</p>
                    <p>Those papers I think are pretty well completed in the White House. There’s
                        one more paper going in this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you mean
                        “White House”?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: At the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>. These are what
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> made May 23rd,<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">See <ref target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note>
                        which are things he was supposed to produce.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, but I don’t
                        want <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> against everybody. I
                        want opposition and <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>
                        position. That’s two alternatives.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What’s your
                        view?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: (a), that we should amend <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName>’s instruction; (b), that he should be encouraged
                        to go back and work out an initial conceptual agreement as soon as
                        possible.</p>

                    <p>Whether that needs to go public or not is another question, although my
                        opinion is there’s no reason not to.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It can’t be kept
                        secret. In fact, if it is supposed to do <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> any good, it has to be public.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Mr. Secretary, it puts the President in an absolutely impossible
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: That he should offer <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> the possibility of postponing the treaty until
                        January of 1977 invites the charge of duplicity, both in terms of domestic
                        politics and in terms of international relations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Besides, it
                        would get public, so we pay exactly the same price.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: It invites initial repercussions.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But it is a
                        major problem because these Panama people are getting a tremendous head of
                        steam up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Well, I think there are two things to be said about that. In the
                        first place, there are plenty of Republicans and Democrats who say, “If you

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: It’s a political problem in both directions. You know, we’re that

                        <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>There is increasing local concern over statements by United States
                        authorities publicly predicting violence unless a new treaty is reached with
                        Panama and suggesting that such violence would gain for Panama as much or
                        more of its objectives than the treaty would provide. Among those expressing
                        concern locally are employee union and civic council members. It is their
                        feeling that such statements may feed violence-prone elements within Panama
                        and breed support for their tactics that would not otherwise be forthcoming.
                        This feeling is shared by many other knowledgeable local observers, both
                        U.S. and Panamanian.</p>
                    <p>The validity of this concern is probably shown by the treatment the
                        Panamanian news media have given to statements of Assistant Secretary of
                        State Rogers and to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                        >Bunker</persName>’s address to the Rainier Club in Seattle.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d81fn2">See <ref target="#d78fn3">footnote 3, Document 78</ref>.
                            Rogers’ statement has not been found.</note> Emphasis, often with
                        sensational treatment as you can see from the attached clippings,<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d81fn3">Not attached.</note> has been placed on the portions of
                        the addresses in which the predictions of violence are made.</p>
                    <p>Public predictions by U.S. spokesmen are being construed by some here as U.S.
                        acceptance of violence as a politically legitimate means for Panama
                        ultimately to gain its treaty objectives. The foremost concern here is that
                        Canal Zone employees and their families may be the victims in a situation of
                        Panamanian violence protesting Congressional intransigence, inspired in part
                        by their interpretations of statements of U.S. officials.</p>
                    <p>I share Secretary Rogers and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>’s concern over the potential for violence here under
                        certain conditions. I understand their desire that the Congress and U.S.
                        public should be fully informed of the possible consequence of an
                        intransigent position vis-à-vis a new treaty. It is conceivable, however,
                        that violence might be avoided if the Panamanian Government is convinced
                        such acts would be counter-productive to gaining ultimate treaty objectives,
                        as I feel certain they would be. Public statements by U.S. officials
                        indicating the contrary <pb n="228" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_228"/>diminish
                        the likelihood of Panama adopting the latter course and tend to lower the
                        local threshold for violence.</p>
                    <p>I realize that the U.S. authorities concerned are faced with a dilemma. There
                        is a need for the Congress and the people to be fully informed on
                        alternatives. On the other hand, U.S. authorities have a responsibility for
                        the welfare of U.S. personnel in the Canal Zone and this responsibility is
                        best served by persuading Panama that violence would be counterproductive to
                        the fulfillment of its objectives.</p>
                    <p>If you share this concern with me, I hope there will be an opportunity for
                        you to discuss with U.S. spokesmen on treaty matters the need to balance
                        carefully the probable effect of their statements on the very dissimilar
                        United States and Panamanian audiences.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary of State has indicated on several occasions in conversation and
                        in meetings that the treaty duration for United States’ responsibility for
                        Canal defense should be from 40–45 years; and he is aware that, if the
                        treaty provides for more than 40 years for defense, it would be acceptable
                        to the Department of Defense, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The
                        Department of Defense continues to support this position on duration.
                        Anything less than a period of over 40 years’ duration would be unacceptable
                        to the Department of Defense, which would prefer to see the duration greater
                        than 45 years.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Lands and Waters issue, the present Defense Department
                        position provides the bare minimum in terms of protection of vital
                        installations of the Canal and United States citizens associated with the
                        Canal operations. Anything less would not be acceptable, in that it would
                        not permit the discharge of Department of Defense responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>In amplification of the above, the fundamental disagreement between Defense
                        and State Departments is that the Department of Defense does not trust the
                        reliability or stability of <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>’ Government. Our mistrust of the Panamanians
                        engenders realistic concerns that under Panamanian control:</p>
                    <p>—Use of the Panama Canal could be denied the United States at any time under
                        any conditions; i.e., Canal transit by United States Naval ships carrying
                        nuclear warheads;</p>
                    <p>—United States citizens associated with the Canal operation would be subject
                        to whims of an illegally spawned dictatorial regime which has repeatedly
                        demonstrated abusive power, disregard of civil liberties, harassment of
                        private citizens, capricious treatment by police and judges and repressed
                        freedom of press, as well as increasing association with communist
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>—Land areas adjacent to population centers would provide unlimited routes of
                        approach for Panamanian mobs and rioters to vital U.S. installations,
                        placing them in danger.</p>
                    <p>Adherence to a negotiating position which assures a United States military
                        presence for more than 40 years, as well as retention of sufficient lands
                        and waters (in return for relinquishing to Panama operational control of the
                        Canal after a shorter period), would provide a deterrent against Panamanian
                        irresponsibility.</p>

                    <p rend="center">PANAMA</p>
                    <p rend="center">Meeting with Congressional Aides</p>
                    <p>We got some interesting commentary and advice from the congressional
                        aides:</p>
                    <p>1. They were all impressed with what the negotiation has yielded thus far as
                        regards protecting U.S. interests. If we get much of what we want on the
                        outstanding issues, we will have a “saleable” treaty.</p>
                    <p>2. Most of them believe we can get a treaty ratified this year—if submitted
                        right after the summer recess—with an all-out administration effort.</p>
                    <p>3. The President must provide positive leadership in the Executive and take a
                        strong public stand soon. Republicans on the Hill will respond <hi
                            rend="italic">positively</hi> to that leadership.</p>
                    <p>4. If the treaty is not submitted now, <hi rend="italic">’76 is out</hi>,
                        although it would be more of a Republican party issue in presidential
                        primaries than a national election issue. <hi rend="italic">After the
                            primaries</hi> we could sign a treaty with less danger than before.</p>
                    <p>5. An initialed treaty would be much more difficult to deal with on the Hill
                        than a signed treaty because it presumably would not be made public. This
                        would cause problems.</p>
                    <p>6. Most senators recognize that opposing congressional mail on Panama is not
                        representative. It has become a cause of the far right and is generally
                        recognized as such. Still, mail on only one side of the issue is
                        troublesome.</p>
                    <p>7. A number of aides were distressed by what they termed State being
                        outmaneuvered by <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> on the Hill. They
                        claim that <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is actively collaborating
                        with treaty opponents while State is hyper-cautious in dealing with treaty
                        friends.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Panama Negotiation</p>
                    <p>Although the Department of Defense has repeatedly affirmed its support for
                        negotiations leading to a new treaty, <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName>’ latest paper (attached) in effect rules out any
                        possibility of attaining one.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">Only the cover
                            sheet is attached; the paper is printed as <ref target="#d82">Document
                                82</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>In his paper—which is addressed directly to the President—<persName
                            corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> asserts, moreover, that anything
                        less than his position on duration (defense) and lands/waters will not be
                        “acceptable” to Defense. That has some of the quality of ultimatum to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be said of the Defense Department’s inter-governmental approach,
                        its substantive position is irrational. Rather than protect military
                        interests over the long term, it would jeopardize them.</p>
                    <p>Attentive to Defense concerns, I compromised on the duration (defense) issue,
                        abandoning my desire for flexibility between 25 and 50 years, agreeing
                        instead to a minimum of 35 years. In return I expected an improvement in the
                        land/water position.</p>
                    <p>The plain fact is that Panama probably would not even buy 25 years without
                        some such improvement. Thus land/water is pivotal.</p>
                    <p>The new Defense position rejects my compromise on duration, and sticks to a
                        40-plus position which is in itself probably unacceptable to Panama and
                        certainly unacceptable without a better offer on land/water, which Defense
                        refuses to give.</p>
                    <p>Justifying the Defense position, <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> claims that 40-plus years, together with the
                        unimproved land/water offer, would provide a deterrent against what he
                        postulates as the irresponsibility of the Panamanian Governments in the next
                        century.</p>
                    <p>He does not make clear how a few-years prolongation of the U.S. military
                        presence or the retention of a few hundred acres of territory would have
                        this effect. Nor does he indicate how the Defense position would provide
                        security for the U.S. citizen employees from alleged Panamanian “whims”.</p>
                    <pb n="232" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_232"/>
                    <p>While it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict international
                        irresponsibility, we are determined to safeguard our rights and interest in
                        the Canal in the treaty we are negotiating.</p>
                    <p>The Defense position would jeopardize long-term military interests in that,
                        by foreclosing a treaty, it would engender protracted confrontation with
                        Panama . . . interfere with our ability to operate the waterway efficiently
                        . . . and endanger our very presence.</p>
                    <p>We believe you will want to caution the President along the foregoing
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we believe it is time to halt this skirmishing. It is now 4½
                        months since I have been in truly substantive negotiation with Panama—and 1½
                        months since you renewed the commitment to negotiate at the OASGA. <note

                        the Negotiators’—is running out.</p>
                    <p>And the President certainly has all the choices before him, now that Defense
                        has in effect recommended a no-treaty choice.</p>

                    </opener>
                    <p>As you know the House of Representatives on Thursday, June 26, passed an
                        amendment to the State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Bill which would
                        have the effect of terminating the negotiations with the Government of
                        Panama regarding a Canal treaty from proceeding.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2"
                            >The amendment to <gloss target="#t_HR_1">H.R.</gloss> 8121 was
                            introduced by Representative <persName corresp="#p_SME_1">Gene
                                Snyder</persName> (R-Kentucky), but was not included in the final
                            version of the appropriations bill. A similar amendment was proposed in
                            the Senate by Senator <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Harry Byrd</persName>
                            (Ind.-Virginia).</note> I believe that this was a most unfortunate
                        action and in itself may stimulate a reaction in Panama and throughout the
                        Western Hemisphere detrimental to the interest of the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="233" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_233"/>
                    <p>The action by the House is disturbing because it brings into question the
                        commitment the United States made in 1964 to enter into good faith
                        negotiations with the Government of Panama on the Canal. Also it interposes
                        by questionable Constitutional means a blocking action by the House of
                        Representatives which would have the effect of preventing the Senate of the
                        United States from exercising its advice and consent once a treaty was
                        submitted.</p>
                    <p>I appeal to you and to the members of your Committee to take the necessary
                        action to reverse this unwise initiative by the House of Representatives. I
                        am appealing in like manner to the Speaker of the House, the Majority and
                        Minority Leaders of the Senate, and the Chairman of the Senate

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Because he wouldn’t be too surprised. Hopefully, a structured
                        response. It was a good response. He said he couldn’t understand how the
                        Congress of the United States could be impatient with appropriations of
                        money for negotiations that dragged on for 11 years. (Laughter.) But
                        privately he’s made very clear that he does not think he can told it
                        together unless he gets these negotiations back on the track. And it’s
                        pretty clear that the House vote brings the issue right out on the
                        table.</p>
                    <p>It’s going to come up on the Senate floor for a very clear vote. And the
                        question of a floor vote is whether or not those negotiations ought to be
                        resumed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Well, you’ve got the
                        Defense Department out campaigning against us very strongly. There’s an
                        article by Marilyn Berger this morning pointing out that <persName

                            a June 27 article by Marilyn Berger, “House Rejects Funds for Canal Zone
                            Talks.” <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Callaway</persName> was quoted as
                            saying: “There’s the feeling that the Canal is enormously valuable, that
                            we paid for it and it’s ours.” (<hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>,

                            >Clements</persName> yesterday and he said, “We have a disagreement.” I
                        said, “Yes, but you should at least give the options to the President—decide
                        what he wants to do.” He said, “That’s up to the State Department. They’re
                        actively campaigning against us.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: There’s a strong belief up on the Hill, according to Dante, that
                        the decision has already been made—not by the President but, at least, his
                        chief advisers—to finesse the issue to 1977. And this was one of the reasons
                        why there was a considerable vote on that amendment yesterday. Dante told me
                        this the night before last.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Yes. And he also said that both <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1"
                            >Callaway</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> are vigorous up on the Hill—expect to postpone
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is
                        crazy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: It is.</p>

                    <p>Now, the issue comes up. It’s going to come up in the Senate—there’s no
                        question about it. They sustain the amendment or amend <pb n="235"
                            facs="0260" xml:id="pg_235"/>it. There’s no way to avoid the issue
                        unless you don’t want an appropriation.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m in favor of
                        vetoing it—just on the principle that this way the Congress is going to run
                        everybody’s negotiation. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Well, if you could beat it off on the Senate floor, obviously
                        you’re better off. Otherwise it’s news to Panama. If the Senate sustains the
                        House, the ballgame’s over, because that puts Panama—notice that we can’t
                        get the treaty through. So what the hell is the sense of going forward with
                        the negotiations?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ve got to talk
                        to the President.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I think if we can reverse the House and the Senate, we can put
                        this to advantage. We can demonstrate to the Panamanians what a serious
                        political problem we have. And we’re prepared to go down the line on the
                        situation. If we lose in the Senate, I think the ballgame is over.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: You can turn off

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: We looked at the question you asked me on Saturday—whether or not
                        we can postpone the initialing of the treaty until after the elections, and

                        treaty was inevitable, we would cooperate. Even that may not do it because
                        if they feed a public debate on whether there’ll be a treaty, which [<hi

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Well, I think let’s take it piece by piece and not go to the man
                        on the big issue. (a), if we can hold off that—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That we have to
                        do on constitutional grounds. It’s absolutely independent—that’s totally
                        independent of the merits of the <persName corresp="#p_SME_1"
                            >Snyder</persName> amendment. But if we permit Congress to determine
                        what we can negotiate about by withholding funds, we’re going to shift the
                        balance in the foreign policy field totally. If the Congress precludes
                        itself from passing on the merits of the negotiation by withholding funds, I
                        think we have to be very, very tough on them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Right. The second thing which I think is crucial: <persName

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>We write with deep personal concern over the progress of negotiations with
                        the Government of the Republic of Panama for a new Panama Canal Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Quite frankly, we are troubled by the failure of the Executive Branch to
                        resolve differences between the Department of State and Department of
                        Defense over fundamental negotiating positions, particularly in regards to
                        the duration of the new treaty and the land and water issues. It is well
                        known that the Department of Defense has yet to develop realistic positions
                        on these issues.</p>
                    <p>We realize the differences within the Executive Branch are properly questions
                        for you to resolve. However, in this case, the very obvious conflict between
                        two key Executive departments has caused serious difficulties in efforts
                        within the Congress to support the general position of your Administration
                        for the negotiation of not only an equitable treaty between our two
                        governments, but one which will also protect U.S. short- and long-term
                        interests as they relate to the operation of the Canal. In essence, unless
                        such a treaty is negotiated and ratified in the coming months, we believe
                        these interests will be placed in serious jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>We understand that in the coming days you will be making a decision as to
                        what the ultimate U.S. position will be on the two matters mentioned above
                        as well as on the strategy for Senate ratification. We cannot impress upon
                        you enough the importance of both making a decision soon on these critical
                        issues and ending the divisive and harmful bureaucratic maneuvering which
                        has already had a detrimental effect on Congressional attitudes toward the
                        treaty, as evidenced by the recent vote in the House on the <persName
                            corresp="#p_SME_1">Snyder</persName> amendment.</p>
                    <p>We do not believe that the prospects for ratification are lost. It would,
                        however, be unfortunate if any department within the Executive Branch
                        undercut our treaty efforts with Panama. As Members of the Foreign Relations
                        Committee, we stand ready to do whatever we can, in cooperation with you, to
                        insure that ratification proceeds in a timely fashion. However, in the
                        absence of a final decision by you, particularly <pb n="239" facs="0264"
                            xml:id="pg_239"/>in establishing a unified position on the treaty within
                        the Executive Branch, we believe our efforts will be fruitless.</p>
                    <p>Again, we stand ready to assist you in this vital matter and would appreciate
                        meeting with you or your representatives if you should so desire. <note

                    <p>4306. Subj: Canal Treaty Negotiations: GOP Discussion of Options.</p>
                    <p>Summary: Embassy has been told in confidence that GOP officials are
                        discussing three options concerning Canal issue. First would be to try to
                        reach agreement with U.S. this year with understanding U.S. would not
                        actively push ratification until 1977. Second would be to continue
                        negotiations without significant Panamanian compromise while stepping up
                        international pressures and in two years obtain better terms than are
                        possible now. Third alternative would be confrontation. All of these
                        alternatives entail problems and risks. It may be that political realities
                        in Washington and Panama have pushed diplomacy and compromise aside. End
                        summary.</p>
                    <p>1. Although GOP’s public stance has been that USG has a commitment with
                        Panama to continue treaty negotiations until causes of conflict are
                        resolved, events of last two weeks have cast layer after layer of pessimism
                        on private attitudes of GOP treaty advisers and other <pb n="240"
                            facs="0265" xml:id="pg_240"/>Panamanians closely associated with issue.
                        While some persons reportedly have concluded that current round of
                        negotiations has run its course, others are still counseling that GOP should
                        not yet act on that conclusion. Each passing day, however, gives the latter
                        less basis for their arguments. Embassy has heard that alternative courses
                        of action are being discussed while <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>, through meetings with students (July 9) and
                        National Assembly of Community Representatives (July 18) and private
                        discussions, is trying to gauge the mood of his constituents. Decisions will
                        be based upon <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ conclusions
                        concerning U.S. intentions and Panamanian political realities.</p>
                    <p>2. Archbishop McGrath (protect source) during visit to Embassy July 14 told
                        EmbOffs that he was aware of three alternatives under discussion.</p>
                    <p>3. First alternative would be to negotiate and sign a treaty this year,
                        although it would not be actively considered by the Senate until 1977.
                        Advantages of this approach would be that Panama’s credit-worthiness would
                        be enhanced. Loans would be more readily available and investors, foreseeing
                        an amicable solution to Canal issue, would increase their stakes in Panama,
                        thus alleviating economic problem. Negative aspects would be that Panama
                        would have to compromise on some issues, and that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> would have difficulty keeping
                        lid on situation in interim.</p>
                    <p>4. Second alternative would be for Panama to draw out the negotiations until
                        1977 without reaching agreement. Concurrently, Panama’s international
                        campaign to exert pressure on U.S. would be accelerated. Advocates of this
                        approach argue that U.S. position is becoming increasingly vulnerable, and
                        Panama could obtain more favorable terms in 1977 or later than it can now.
                        Disadvantage of this approach is that tension will inhibit investment and
                        economic growth.</p>
                    <p>5. Third option would be to admit negotiations have stalled and enter into
                        symbolic and physical confrontation. Students would be allowed to make
                        incursions into the Canal Zone and create disturbances, thus provoking a
                        violent response from U.S. forces. The Canal issue would be forced into the
                        United Nations, and worldwide condemnation of the U.S. would be generated.
                        This would be an acceleration of the process described under option two
                        except that the risks for Panama would be greater. Disorders would aggravate
                        Panama’s economic difficulties, and <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> would risk losing control of situation.</p>
                    <p>6. Foreign Ministry source told EmbOff July 16 that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> was trying to stave off the
                        students, but that the ball was now in U.S. hands. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ interpretation of U.S. actions
                        in near future would influence decisions in Panama about what must be done
                        in U.S.-Panamanian relations.</p>
                    <pb n="241" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_241"/>
                    <p>7. Comment: In Panama, as well as in Washington, the time of analysis and
                        decision may be passing and the force of domestic political realities may
                        become dominant. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ decision
                        to discuss negotiations with students and NACR representatives is indicative
                        of the political pressures on him. He is much more responsible to popular
                        pressures and has less independence of action than is generally believed in
                        some U.S. circles. In our view, a key factor which <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> must be weighing concerning
                        alternative one (para 3 above) is whether he could keep the students and
                        ultranationalists waiting until 1977 when U.S. would begin ratification of a
                        treaty. Option two represents “pure” nationalist thinking on how to handle
                        the Canal issue and has been consistently pushed by hardliners who oppose
                        any significant compromise in the negotiation. It is based upon the belief
                        that time and the thrust of history works to Panama’s favor (see Panama
                        3766). <note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">In telegram 3766 from Panama City, June
                            24, the Embassy provided a background paper on the “pure nationalist”
                            position held by certain Panamanian officials, asserting that advocates
                            of such a position believed that reason, time, and intransigence
                            intelligently applied would benefit the Panamanians on the Canal issue.

                    <p>President: Henry, would you outline the options as you see them?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: As things now stand,
                        negotiations are stalled and everyone is getting itchy. We have not been
                        able to let <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> go back to Panama
                        since March because he has exhausted his negotiating instructions. Unless we
                        give him new instructions, the stalemate continues. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> is under increasing pressure to
                        take more vigorous action against us. The other Latins are getting into the
                        act. As I pointed out to you this morning, you have a personal letter from
                        the President of Costa Rica, who said he and the Presidents of Colombia and
                        Venezuela together with <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        would march arm-in-arm into the Canal Zone as a symbol of Latin American
                        solidarity if it is necessary.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d70">Document 70</ref>. The memorandum of conversation of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s morning meeting
                            with the President is in the Ford Library, National Security Adviser,
                            Memoranda of Conversations, Box 14, July 23, 1975—<persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>.</note> It is not difficult to foresee that
                        unless we begin the negotiations again there will be increasing unrest and
                        eventually all Latin Americans will join in and we will have a <hi
                            rend="italic">cause celebre</hi> on our hands.</p>
                    <p>As I see it, you have three strategic options to choose from: first, to
                        pronounce that we have reached an impasse and see no point to continuing the
                        negotiations; second, tell <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> to
                        resume negotiations within the limits of his existing instructions; this
                        would lead simply to stalemate. We can sweeten each of these two options by
                        giving a little more flexibility on lands and waters and duration—that would
                        have the advantage of making the situation more tolerable, but it would have
                        the disadvantage of giving away things which we will need to bargain with
                        later on. The third option would be to return <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> to the negotiations with new negotiating
                        instructions. We would have to consider the political situation here in the
                        United States; in the first place, there is a strong feeling in the Congress
                        against a treaty, and second, there is probably a feeling in the country in
                        opposition to a treaty. Wherever I go I get unfriendly questions on the
                        Panama Canal. <pb n="243" facs="0268" xml:id="pg_243"/>We can handle the
                        negotiations in such a way that the political considerations are
                        mitigated.</p>
                    <p>(Discussion was interrupted for a few minutes while the President went out of
                        the room.)</p>
                    <p>The question is, if you want a treaty, can we conduct negotiations in such a
                        way that they do not come to a conclusion before the end of 1976? I think we
                        can do so. We have to make some progress but not necessarily conclude an
                        agreement. We can get an understanding with Panama that we reach certain
                        conceptual agreements on various items, but no final agreement. Our
                        negotiations would continue and progress during 1976 but they would not be
                        concluded. It will not be easy to do but we think we can. If you want to go
                        that route, it would be a mistake to give away anything just to keep the lid
                        on things. The instructions have to be changed. As they now stand <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> is required to negotiate 50 years
                        for both operation and defense. We recommend a substantial reduction for
                        operations to 25 years and defense to 45; then, as a fallback, to go not
                        lower than 40 years for defense and 20 years for operation. We’re not
                        insisting on exact details. The questions are, first, do you want a treaty?
                        and do you want the negotiations to go forward? Second, will you agree to
                        change the instructions? Then, third, what is the minimum beyond which we
                        should not go?</p>
                    <p>President: It is my feeling that yes, we want a treaty, if it is something we
                        have bargained for which will protect our rights. We don’t want a blow-up
                        here in the United States or down there, either. We want the situation under
                        control here and certainly not a renewal of the fighting from 1964 there
                        where people were killed and we had a hell of a mess.</p>
                    <p>I’ve looked over the papers you sent me, including suggestions from the
                        Defense Department. Jim, do you have anything to add to this?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The important question
                        you have to answer is, do you want a treaty? In my judgment we would give
                        away 85 percent of what is most important to us in giving away sovereignty.
                        We will be out of the Canal in 15 years whether we get 40 or 35 years’
                        duration. Our experience in the Philippines is an example. In 1947 we got
                        base rights for 99 years. That was reduced to 55 years in 1966 and now they
                        may let us remain as their guests. That is the reality. I sympathize with
                            <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName>. If we want a treaty,
                        we have to be willing to give up a little more. The question is, do you want
                        a treaty?</p>
                    <p>President: You say we don’t want a treaty?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I’ve tried to stay out
                        of this but I’m reluctant to give up sovereignty.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then none of these things
                        we’re talking about makes any difference.</p>
                    <pb n="244" facs="0269" xml:id="pg_244"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I tried to indicate
                        that. The flexibility you’re seeking here is a moot point, because the
                        length you stay in the Canal will be determined by what the Panama
                        Government decides to do ten years from now. It will not be something we can
                        protect.</p>
                    <p>President: Bill, what’s your view?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I don’t feel as strongly as
                        Jim. He is consistent in his desire not to give up sovereignty. The world we
                        live in today is not the world of Teddy Roosevelt; those circumstances just
                        don’t exist today. If we want to maintain our relationships with South
                        America, and they are important, we need to have a more enlightened view
                        than that of trying to maintain our sovereignty over the Panama Canal. If we
                        work at it, and the Army will do so, if we give them the right framework to
                        work in, we can maintain the right relationship. If we go down there and
                        apply ourselves and make it worth their while, give them a stake in keeping
                        the Canal going, then I think we can look forward to long tenure and the
                        betterment of our position in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>President: Then you feel we can achieve the two objectives—of keeping an
                        explosion from occurring in Panama, and the situation under control here in
                        the United States? If we can agree on terms to protect our interests, we can
                        proceed to an understanding.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes, sir. It won’t be easy
                        and it’s complex, and will require your help. You’ll have to inject yourself
                        in a moderating sense; you’ll have to say, “These things are happening under
                        my direction.”</p>
                    <p>President: If we show good faith, and they act in a sophisticated way, we can
                        achieve our purposes. We have a problem with the Americans in that area. I
                        have been involved for a long time in this question from back in 1953 and
                        1954. They have a sinecure down there which they don’t want to give up. I’m
                        not going to let them dictate American policy. There is a long history of
                        Americans who have a good life down there. But they are not going to decide
                        this. Bill has indicated a reasonable approach, and it coincides with
                        Henry’s view. Can it be handled, <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName>?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: Yes, we will need to reach
                        some conceptual agreements by . . .</p>
                    <p>President: The spring of ’76?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I think by January of 1976,
                        when they have the anniversary of the riots. But there won’t be any treaty
                        writing. We can complete the agreement in late 1976, early 1977, sign it in
                        December of 1976 or January of 1977. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"

                        through proposals that have been made earlier. Everyone who has communicated
                        with us about this is dead-set against it, but we’re already started down
                        the road and we can’t back out now.</p>
                    <p>President: Do you think 45 and 25 years is defensible?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Yes, and the Chiefs do too.
                        We’ve looked at lands and waters this morning with <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWP_1">Bill Clements</persName> and I looked at it again
                        this afternoon; this is key and we need to be forthcoming. The management of
                        defense at the turn of the century required lands that we don’t need now.
                        But we don’t want to give any more than the Ambassador has already been
                        authorized.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: But the Panamanians have
                        turned that down.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Have you offered them
                        everything that the Chiefs have authorized you to?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I have offered everything and
                        have been turned down.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have a suggestion: would
                        it be possible, after you have made a decision that you want to go ahead
                        with this, to see whether State and Defense can sit down to write up where
                        they agree and where they disagree and come to you for the decision with
                        pro’s and con’s. I have never studied this thing really. On duration I agree
                        with Jim—once you decide you want a treaty of a determinate length, a few
                        years one way or another don’t make much difference. On lands and waters, I
                        have not studied this myself and I couldn’t give you an opinion on whom I
                        support; I don’t know the State or the Defense position. State and Defense
                        and the Joint Chiefs and the CIA could get together in a week and have ready
                        for you on your return the issues in the negotiations. If there is
                        agreement, we can submit it to you by paper. If we disagree, then we can
                        have another meeting.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I’d like to make one
                        comment. Our attitude is as important as anything else. There’s a lot of
                        cosmetics in a thing like this. We run the place down there like a U.S.
                        colony. The people in India under the British Empire weren’t treated any
                        worse.</p>
                    <p>President: You said it the way I feel and better.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: There are a lot of things
                        we can do down there to assist <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: It’s not the way the U.S.
                        citizens are treated but the Panamanian employees. Their schooling is
                        different, their treatment, their pay, the facilities available to them.</p>
                    <pb n="246" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_246"/>
                    <p>President: Exactly—the same job but different pay. I know from my experience
                        on the committees that they can be very vocal and have a disproportionate
                        influence from their numbers. Somewhat like the Greeks.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Much greater.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: There are only 17,000
                        Zonians.</p>
                    <p>President: It’s the Zonians who go on from one generation to another.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My mail is 100 percent
                        against a treaty.</p>
                    <p>President: I think it’s similar in the White House. This is a delicate
                        problem. It has to be handled with skill. Going back to 1954, when I think
                        payment for the Canal was about $456,000,<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">The
                            actual sum was $430,000.</note> and President Eisenhower increased it to
                        several million, there was a hullabaloo. That was first modification of the
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>: I believe there were
                        amendments in 1936 and 1954.<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5">In 1936 and 1954,
                            the United States renegotiated aspects of the 1903 Panama Canal Treaty,
                            including raising the annual payment to Panama.</note></p>
                    <p>President: There was a real hullabaloo raised then. Most of the objections
                        came from the Zonians.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: No one else really cares
                        about the financial transactions.</p>
                    <p>President: We all agree this is a very sensitive subject. Jim has a different
                        view, but I am sure we agree that this is very sensitive. It is incumbent on
                        us, with the sensitivity that this problem has, that we keep our
                        differences, if any, to an absolute minimum, and certainly avoid public
                        differences. Any discussion of what we talk about here could be
                        misinterpreted. Since we all understand, it is mandatory we keep it to the
                        eight or nine who are here and we work with <persName corresp="#p_ER_1"
                            >Ellsworth</persName>.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: There is a former
                        Secretary of the Army who has some very strong views—I’d like to make three
                        points: first, you may want to talk to <persName corresp="#p_CHH_1">Bo
                            Callaway</persName>, your campaign manager, about this; he has some very
                        strong views, and he is supposed to be supporting you. Second, a point of
                        intelligence. I don’t agree with the general tendency of the intelligence
                        analyses of the Latins’ attitudes on this. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not
                            declassified</hi>] Third, on the matter of duration: whether it’s 40 or
                        35 years, we are creating a phantasm in that once they control operations,
                        then they can stop the Canal. Defense would be moot. I’d like to ask the
                        Committee to see if 30 years for each would not make more sense. Under those
                        circumstances, we might have rights but couldn’t keep the Canal open.</p>
                    <pb n="247" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_247"/>
                    <p>Colby: On the intelligence point, I agree with you, Jim, when you are talking
                        about Ecuador, Peru and Chile, which are directly affected by this. But
                        there are many other Latin Americans—in the Caribbean and elsewhere—who are
                        chiefly concerned about the political issues and are not so directly
                        involved.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Peru won’t do us any good,
                        whatever Velasco said to <persName corresp="#p_WVA_1">Walters</persName>.
                        They will be in the vocal forefront of those attacking us on this issue.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: I agree that on the
                        surface there is no support for the U.S., but under the surface there is
                        much more.</p>
                    <p>Colby: Whatever deal we work out, 40 or 30 years, someone will come around in
                        ten years to raise the issue again. The relationship between us is the
                        important thing.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree that when you give
                        up sovereignty you move into a new era. The question is whether you can hold
                        on to it at an acceptable cost. I think we probably could maintain our
                        sovereignty if we wanted to, but not at an acceptable cost. It would become
                        a major propaganda point; it would engulf even the moderates and our
                        friends. People like the Brazilians at these conferences support the
                        Panamanians totally. In six years another President will face the same
                        problem again. I agree with the dangers which Jim has outlined, but it would
                        be a little more manageable if we could get ahead of the curve.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: You are in a difficult
                        position, once President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>
                        decided to modernize our relationship. To go back on that is difficult. The
                        position of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> was
                        tougher than the one in 1967.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Even the position of
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> didn’t go to the heart of
                        Jim’s point. It was tougher than LBJ’s but 40 or 60 years are not ultimately
                        the question, as long as there is a limit.</p>
                    <p>President: As I remember <persName corresp="#p_ARB_1">Bob Anderson</persName>
                        talking to me in 1966 and 1967, what we talked about was more forthcoming
                        than what we are talking about now.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: The present position is
                        quite a bit tougher.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s one of the
                        liabilities we’re working under, if you add the ten years which have
                        elapsed—our position automatically becomes more difficult.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>: Mr. President, I think
                        you’re facing three choices: you can acquiesce, you can recant, or you can
                        procrastinate.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Opportunity is another
                        choice.</p>
                    <p>President: We want to be sure that the method we select is the right one.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They should get together.
                        We won’t do anything until they get together—we won’t tell <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> anything.</p>

                        then said that to get duration of presence, we must give moderately on Land
                        and Water Use and to ensure a U.S. presence after the end of the period
                        covered in the treaty (20/45 years). To do this, that is, achieve duration,
                        we must have some give on the Land and Water situation. We cannot get
                        everything, that is, 45 years and free use of Land and Water. We can get an
                        acceptable treaty if we work out a balance between Land and Water Use and
                        duration.</p>
                    <p>The Panamanians needed:</p>
                    <p>1. Something that would have initial impact, that is, near urban areas where
                        U.S. profile was too high.</p>
                    <p>2. Some jointness on Canal operation and military installations.</p>
                    <p>3. Some progress over lifetime of treaty in reducing our military profile and
                        military structure.</p>
                    <p>4. Economic development (including highway corridor for Panamanians) perhaps
                        Albrook Field.</p>
                    <pb n="249" facs="0274" xml:id="pg_249"/>
                    <p>Bell said it would be very helpful if we could promise to turn over one
                        military installation right after the treaty—perhaps Fort Gulick.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing was an educated guess of what the Panamanians wanted.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> asked what we were
                        defending the Canal against. Was it against some other power or against
                        disorders in Panama. He asked me my opinion and I said fundamentally it was
                        the latter case. General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>
                        philosophized aloud about whether it might not be more desirable to pull out
                        completely and give the Canal and Zone to the Panamanians. In reply to a
                        question from General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>,
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> indicated the
                        Panamanians would not seek removal of the School of the Americas.</p>
                    <p>I asked what percentage of Panama’s GNP was dependent on their share of Canal
                        tolls, and expenditures of U.S. Forces. Secretary Rogers said 13% and both
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> found this figure very
                        low. Secretary Rogers said it was a good figure and reliable. It seems low
                        to me, too.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion of how much tolls could be raised without reducing
                        traffic and it was reported that the Governor had had a study made by a
                        California firm<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">Not found.</note> and the
                        conclusion had been that the tolls could be raised as much as 50% without
                        cutting traffic. Secretary Rogers voiced some doubts about this.</p>
                    <p>I asked if any input was expected from CIA for this paper which was to be
                        drafted by Defense (<gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>) and the reply was
                        “nothing.” General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>, however,
                        asked that we make an input as to the possible threat from Panamanian
                        instability or subversives. I agreed.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that the paper should go beyond mere Water and Land Use and
                        give:</p>
                    <p>1. Issues</p>
                    <p>2. Points of agreement between State and Defense</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>I am happy to report that our firm pressure on Defense, coupled with the
                        sensible attitude adopted by <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Bill
                            Clements</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">George
                            Brown</persName>, resulted in the resolution this morning of
                        State-Defense differences on land and water use in the Panama Canal
                        negotiating package. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> overcame
                        the intransigence of our authorities (military and civil) in the Canal Zone
                        by devising a degree-of-risk concept making it possible to add seven areas
                        and facilities (of defense or operational significance) to <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s negotiating kit. Our memorandum to
                        the President will point out that we have more work to do on such problems
                        as selecting bases for designation as joint facilities, reducing our
                        military presence and consolidating our base structure over time. However,
                        that program need not delay <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s
                        return to Panama to negotiate land-water use. Since this morning’s meeting
                        was attended by <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> and Colby (as well as <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and Rogers), I believe we can make
                        this compromise stick. <persName corresp="#p_ER_1">Bob Ellsworth</persName>
                        was also present: like <persName corresp="#p_SJR_1">Schlesinger</persName>
                        he strongly opposes any give but he has been overruled by <persName

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have to have
                        a little exchange with him first. Then he can go down. It doesn’t make any

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Come on—you
                        can’t sit on a thing for three months, leak us all to death, and then
                        suddenly go. You know what impression that is going to make in Latin
                        America. It is just not possible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> did a good job, because he really
                        had to beat those people over there.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m delighted.
                        Now, nothing is going to happen until we get the memo to the President.<note

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Last night we worked out a joint Defense-State position, really
                        something of a minor miracle.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that going to
                        come through me, or will I find it on the President’s desk?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: I will tell you exactly the procedure. It is going to you, from
                            <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> and <persName

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: It will be there tomorrow, no later than noon, because <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> is going to sign tomorrow
                        morning, assuming Bob signs it this evening.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: After that we
                        will send the message.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: That should clear the way for the message.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And then we will
                        get an answer.<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">Telegram 189243 to Panama City,

                    <p>The United States Negotiators requested new instructions from you on three
                        major issues in the negotiation:</p>
                    <p>—the duration of the new treaty;</p>
                    <p>—the distribution of land/water areas in the existing Canal Zone between
                        Panama and the United States; and</p>
                    <p>—the rights of the United States respecting any expansion of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>The Departments of State and Defense agreed earlier in recommendations to you
                        for new instructions on the Canal-expansion issue. They have now agreed in
                        recommendations to you on the duration and land/water issues.</p>
                    <p>They have also designed, for your approval, a process of negotiation with
                        Panama which should minimize the intrusion of “the Panama problem” into our
                        domestic political process next year. Thereby the nation should be able to
                        examine more objectively and deliberately the question of how that problem
                        is to be resolved.</p>
                    <p>An agreed draft <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> incorporating all the
                        recommendations for altered instructions is attached for your
                            consideration.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">Attached but not printed. The
                            signed version of <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 302 is printed
                            as <ref target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>The Departments join in seeking an early decision from you so that the United
                        States Negotiators may promptly resume negotiations with Panama. It is
                        important that we break the negotiating “impasse” which Panama has
                        alleged.</p>

                        Instructions</p>
                    <p>The Negotiators would seek a minimum of 40 years duration of the treaty for
                        Canal defense and 20 years for Canal operation. Their “opening” position
                        would be, respectively, 50 and 25 years.</p>
                    <pb n="254" facs="0279" xml:id="pg_254"/>
                    <p>The Negotiators would carry into the next negotiating round an offer to
                        Panama on the land/water issue which is improved over the original offer by
                        the addition of options for the Negotiators contained in the second
                        attachment to this memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">The attachment,
                            undated, entitled “Options for United States Negotiators,” is attached
                            but not printed.</note></p>
                    <p>These options have been provided by the Defense Department following a review
                        of its previous position on lands and waters. The review substantiated, in
                        the Defense Department’s judgment, the soundness of its previous position
                        and noted that the options would subject the operation and defense of the
                        Canal to some risks. However, recognizing that other imperatives may require
                        modification of the Defense Department position in order to pursue
                        negotiations, the list of options developed, though involving some risks,
                        might be acceptable to you.</p>
                    <p>These additions would impact to some degree on either Canal operation or
                        defense for the treaty’s lifetime. The additions are intended to help the
                        Negotiators secure from Panama a commitment to negotiate prior to the
                        termination of the treaty a mutually satisfactory agreement concerning
                        United States involvement in Canal defense, including a limited post-treaty
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the Departments of State and Defense have agreed to study the
                        feasibility of certain other measures which might be taken to make our land
                        and water position more acceptable to Panama. These are: redesignation of
                        and/or joint arrangements for certain United States bases; designation of a
                        United States base as a combined United States-Panamanian headquarters; and
                        a long-range commitment to reduce United States military installations.</p>
                    <p>Respecting the issue of Canal expansion, the Negotiators would seek a
                        definitive and exclusive option for the treaty period (operation), but
                        recede if necessary to a “first-refusal right” for that period, and agree to
                        negotiate terms with Panama should we ever decide to expand the waterway’s
                        capacity.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">B.</hi> On the Negotiating
                        Process</p>
                    <p>The Negotiators would resume negotiations in early September. Thereafter,
                        they would try to arrange that the two parties reach substantial agreement
                        on the broad outlines of most if not all of the major issues before next
                        January 9, the 12th anniversary of the 1964 student riots. It is important
                        for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> to be convinced before
                        that date that solid, steady negotiating progress is being made.</p>
                    <pb n="255" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_255"/>
                    <p>Any agreements on negotiating issues would, of course, be confidential and
                            <hi rend="italic">ad referendum.</hi> They would serve as guidelines for
                        the subsequent resolving of the many minor negotiating issues and drafting
                        of the actual treaty text.</p>
                    <p>Proceeding with all deliberate speed, the treaty text would not be ready
                        before September-October of next year. At that juncture the United States
                        and Panamanian Negotiators would submit it to their governments for
                        approval. It would be arranged that approval would not be forthcoming until
                        after our elections are completed. The treaty would be signed publicly
                        following the elections and submitted to the Senate for ratification in
                        January 1977.</p>
                    <p>Provided there is satisfactory and uninterrupted negotiating progress in the
                        period culminating with the draft treaty text, <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> is likely to acquiesce in the process described
                        above. He might, however, insist at some point in the latter stages of the
                        process on having a private commitment from you that the treaty would in
                        fact be signed following the elections and sent to the Senate in January.
                        Alternatively, he might desire that the treaty text at least be initialed
                        confidentially by the Negotiators, <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> to
                        governments, as soon as it is ready. Our Negotiators believe they would be
                        in a position to resist such a confidential initialing should you desire
                        that they do so.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the foregoing process, the two Departments would join in
                        consulting steadily and confidentially with the Congress, to keep it
                        informed of negotiating progress and to begin building adequate support for
                        eventual treaty ratification. Presumably Panama would be undertaking a
                        similar effort—a national plebiscite will be required there for treaty
                        ratification, and <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> will
                        have to convince his people that he has not “sold out” to the United States
                        in the new treaty.</p>

                        concerning proposals for negotiating instructions on a new United

                        supplement them as follows:</p>
                    <p>—The negotiators are authorized to propose to the Panamanians that the treaty
                            <hi rend="italic">duration</hi> applicable for defense be separated from
                        its application to operation of the Canal. With regard to duration
                        applicable to operation of the Canal, the United States negotiators should
                        seek to obtain the longest possible period, to terminate not earlier than
                        December 31, 1999. With regard to duration applicable to defense of the
                        Canal, they should seek to obtain a minimum of 50 years, but are authorized
                        to recede to no less than 40 years. They should also make efforts to obtain
                        a right in principle for the United States to participate in Canal defense,
                        including a limited military presence in Panama, following the expiration of
                        the treaty period applicable to defense, such participation to be of a

                        one year prior to the treaty’s expiration. As a fallback, if deemed
                        necessary to achieve the objective of an extended period for Canal defense
                        or other critical negotiating objectives, the Negotiators may offer a
                        reduction of the duration period applicable to Canal operation to a period
                        of not less than 20 years.</p>

                        Negotiators should seek to obtain the longest possible period up to the

                        States option to exercise definitive and exclusive rights to expand the
                        Canal’s capacity, whether by addition of a third lane of locks or the
                        construction of a <pb n="257" facs="0282" xml:id="pg_257"/>sea-level canal.
                        As a fallback, they may seek to obtain—either in lieu of or in combination
                        with definitive rights—commitments that: (a) Panama will not permit the
                        construction of a sea level canal in its territory during the period of
                        United States control of the existing Canal unless it has first offered to
                        the United States the option to construct such a canal. That option should
                        be under terms and conditions which would accord to the United States rights
                        relating to operation and defense commensurate with the due protection and
                        enjoyment of a United States investment of that magnitude; (b) no country
                        other than the United States or Panama shall have responsibility for
                        operation and defense of an interoceanic canal in Panama; and (c) the
                        neutrality guarantee applicable to the existing Canal will apply to any new
                        canal built in Panama.</p>

                    <p>I’d like to call your attention to a personnel problem which I believe to be
                        of some importance.</p>
                    <p>The Deputy Canal Negotiator is a Foreign Service Officer with the personnel
                        rank of Minister by name of Morey Bell. His relations with the Pentagon have
                        steadily deteriorated over the last two years and reached the place where
                            <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> simply has no confidence in him and
                        is deeply concerned over his influence with <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName>. There are many in Defense genuinely interested in
                        obtaining a treaty who believe that the Negotiators (i.e., Bell) are not
                        getting the point across to the Panamanians that there is no more slack in
                        the lands and waters proposal and that if there is to be Defense support for
                        a treaty, Panama will have to accept it more or less as it stands.</p>
                    <p>Things reached such a point that <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> raised the issue with <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1"
                            >Ingersoll</persName>, requesting either that Bell be replaced, or that
                        a second Deputy be named from the Defense Department.</p>
                    <p>It is my understanding that the matter has never been presented to <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> but instead was referred to the
                        Secretary, who may have some hesitation about appointing <gloss
                            target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> people to positions of this kind based on
                        considerations beyond the Panama issue.</p>
                    <p>From my own experience, Defense has very strong grounds for its complaints in
                        this case. I believe that without a better basis for trust as the
                        negotiations proceed, we will not get Defense’s support for the treaty which
                        ultimately emerges, and, as a result, seriously damage our chances of
                        obtaining its approval in the Senate.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                    <p>If the appropriate occasion arises, you may want to reinforce with the
                        Secretary the importance of acceding to one or the other of Defense’s <pb

                    <p>A) To the Panamanians they said that we would not be prepared to sign a
                        treaty for a year or two, but that</p>
                    <p>—the President was serious in his desire to negotiate a new treaty;</p>
                    <p>—the Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, though unenthusiastic
                        at first, were now fully committed to a new agreement;</p>
                    <p>—any violence would make this more difficult for us and therefore we needed
                        Panamanian cooperation in keeping the situation quiet.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> responded that he
                        needed:</p>
                    <pb n="260" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_260"/>
                    <p>—help from the Zone militarily to keep the situation quiet;</p>
                    <p>—some successes (“conquistas”) to demonstrate to his people that the U.S. was
                        serious in its purpose.</p>
                    <p>B) To the American military commanders, both the Governor and the CINC,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> stated</p>
                    <p>—their unequivocal support for the negotiations;</p>
                    <p>—the expectation that we could arrive at a new agreement in the next year or
                        two;</p>
                    <p>—their insistence that we begin now preparing Panamanians to take over from
                        us at the end of the treaty period.</p>
                    <p>They directed the U.S. military commanders in Panama to adopt a new attitude
                        from the top-down, looking towards a more cooperative relationship with the
                        Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>There are already indications that in spite of this forthright attitude and
                        the initial impression of unity, problems between State and Defense are
                        likely to reappear. The party included Assistant Secretary of the Army
                            <persName corresp="#p_VVV_1">Veysey</persName>, who has responsibility
                        for the Canal. However, <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>
                        made very clear that he himself would continue handling the Panama matter
                        personally, and he left <persName corresp="#p_VVV_1">Veysey</persName> out
                        of it. He told us frankly (and privately) that <gloss target="#t_ISA_1"
                            >ISA</gloss> was not “with us” on this matter. I believe the new Army
                        Secretary (Marty Hoffman) will not be long in wanting to assert his voice in
                        this (he ‘owns’ the Canal Company, as you know), and that he will be

                        ago.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: I am sorry to see your Embassy was attacked.<note n="2"

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are making a mistake.
                        We are trying to get it done, but we have to say certain things. And it is
                        terribly emotional in this country and we can’t do it until the elections
                        are over. Then we can sign in 1977.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: Let me be frank. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        says the same thing, that he has to have something to show.</p>
                    <p>The President: We sent <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> down
                        there with a new position.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, it was much more
                        forthcoming. We did start with 50 years, though.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: They don’t think so. Let me tell you, it is easier for a small country
                        to negotiate with a big one than with one of equal size. I would rather
                        negotiate with the Soviet Union than Panama.</p>
                    <p>I asked how they would defend the canal. They said they had thought of that
                        and offered to let the U.S. in in case of aggression.</p>
                    <p>In the Canal Zone, they want to have full jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That they can get after
                        the transition period. That is not the problem. The problem is about
                        guerrilla action and the border line between civil disturbance and guerrilla
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: It is between action against third parties and action between
                        Panamanians.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. We do have the right
                        to defend the Canal against third parties. We have asked for 50 years, but
                        we can slip that.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: Do you need fourteen bases?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look, we can maneuver so
                        we can give up more, but if we have to do it all now and with publicity, the
                        Congress will stop it. We must have time. We sent a different team down
                        there and we found we can give up a lot. We can give up a little at a time
                        so that over the<pb n="265" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_265"/> period they will
                        get what they need. But we need to maneuver. The House just voted again to
                        take away our ability to negotiate.<note n="3" xml:id="d100fn3">On September
                            24, the House rejected a conference committee compromise on the language
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_SME_1">Snyder</persName> Amendment to the

                    <p>The President: That is right, and 32 senators sent me a letter against a
                        treaty. They should know that a newly elected President can do a lot that I
                        can’t now.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: If you could do something without negotiating.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Outside the
                        discussions?</p>
                    <p>Lopez: Yes. Something you are not going to use.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You think that would
                        help?</p>
                    <p>Lopez: Very much.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That I think we can do.
                        Defense would go along with some of that. We had been holding it back for
                        the negotiation, but we can do it now.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: The small things. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        has his own enemies who say he is getting nowhere after a year. If he had
                        something concrete, even small, it would help him.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will look at it. We had
                        decided against it in the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The President: Let’s look into it.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I haven’t looked at the
                        Defense team report, but we can do something.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: I want to make clear I am not threatening. I am not the bearer of any
                        threats.</p>
                    <p>The President: You will be very well received on the Hill. No threats, giving
                        up aid, help on drugs.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: I don’t want to say that without a treaty Panama could be another
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you could tell them,
                        however, the attitude of all of Latin America, so then they understand just
                        what the attitudes are.</p>

                    <p>8. (C/NFD) <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">TORRIJOS</persName>, as mentioned
                        above, remained listening attentively, but then came his turn to speak, very
                        much aware that whatever he said would be reported by me to higher
                        authorities. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">TORRIJOS</persName> began and I
                        quote because I feel his remarks were sincere and he does mean to carry out
                        the actions planned. These were his words:</p>
                    <p>“Look [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>], I don’t think we will
                        get a quick treaty (meaning the treaty negotiations taking place). In fact,
                        I don’t think we will get anywhere the way things are moving. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’S visits to Panama are useless and
                        nonproductive. We are not getting what we want and just recently it was
                        mentioned that the signing of a treaty is two years from now. This is too
                        long a period to wait. We will have to start something—do something about
                        it. We cannot wait; our patience is running out. I don’t know how long I can
                        hold back the people, the students, even the young <gloss target="#t_GN_1"
                            >GN</gloss> officers back from taking action. I believe I can hold them
                        off about one year, at least until next summer but no longer than that. I am
                        planning to get hold of these radicals and train them in the use of weapons
                        and at least keep them at bay for a while. I plan to start recruiting 2000
                        more <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> troops and I plan to purchase
                        long-range weapons, something we can use against PQ sites from as far as La
                        Chorrera. I know the US will not sell me these types of weapons, nor will
                        any country over which the US has influence, but I will get them anyway.
                        Little by little and piece by piece I will get some high caliber weapons for
                        my <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss>. I will not ask help from Russia or
                        Cuba because I was once advised by Josif “Tito” BROZ of Yugoslavia never to
                        ask Russia for help because I would end up with Russians on my hands. This
                        would never solve my problem of kicking the “gringos” out while allowing the
                        Russians to come in. I <pb n="267" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_267"/>don’t trust
                        the Cubans for the same reasons. I could easily turn into a Communist, but I
                        am not a Communist. I am a Panamanian whose desire is to have Panama, from
                        border to border, for the Panamanians. When the time comes and I can no
                        longer hold back my people, we will have to resort to drastic action, maybe
                        harassment, maybe guerrilla action. My people can cause plenty of damage to
                        PQ based elements and installations. They are good in jungle-type actions. I
                        know you people have good leaders and troops for this type of warfare but I
                        think we can do enough to start something and get the treaty moving faster.
                        I don’t think that my <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> will confront your
                        troops in sustained combat because I know you can whip us, but we will give
                        you plenty of trouble in guerrilla-type warfare. Don’t think I will be at
                        the head of them as I mentioned in one of my speeches as leading and being
                        in front of my troops against the PQ. I am not that stupid to get shot
                        first. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>], I am backed against
                        the wall and I can do nothing but go ahead with what I think I must do. I am
                        tired of the whole mess and I sure as hell wish that I had never gotten into
                        this situation. I wish I had the money to take off and leave all this to
                        hell but I have given my word and I have no choice but to go through with
                        it. I will let you know when the time runs out so you can get the hell out
                        of the way. Please believe me, you are my friend and I would never wish harm
                        to befall you.”</p>

                    <p>The Deputy Negotiator level talks conducted in Panama (September 27–October
                        12), were useful in clarifying many Panamanian misconceptions concerning the
                        United States offer which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> presented in early September.<note n="2"

                        Panamanians—with the benefit of further explanations—reacted more favorably
                        to a number of points and characterized the United States approach as “more
                        positive” then they had at first imagined. Clearly, however, Panama still
                        has significant substantive problems regarding our position on issues such
                        as duration, neutrality, a residual defense presence, and lands/waters.</p>
                    <p>At the urging of the United States team, Panama seems prepared to make some
                        kind of counteroffer.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3">In telegram 259835 to

                        divided on how to assess and respond to our offer. Thus, it is not possible
                        to predict at this point the nature of Panama’s response or when it will be
                        forthcoming. While we have assured the Panamanian team that we are prepared
                        to resume discussion whenever they are ready, we have also made it clear
                        that the next move is up to them. Until we receive a concrete Panamanian
                        counterproposal, we are not able to do much toward narrowing the remaining
                        differences between our respective negotiating positions.</p>

                        government in coping with its domestic political problems associated with a

                        ahead with a series of US actions. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> indicated that such actions should begin now, be
                        staged over the negotiating period and be a mix of symbol and substance in
                        both military and non-military areas. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> and certain of his key advisors made several
                        specific suggestions to our Deputy Negotiator regarding possible unilateral
                        actions which will be examined jointly by State and Defense.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Department of Defense is actively considering a variety of
                        earlier proposals. The first, which involves the National Guard’s use of
                        some seaplane ramps in the Zone, has already been approved and was offered
                        to Panama last week. We expect to have Defense’s more detailed views on
                        other possible steps next week. As these measures are identified and
                        approved, we can decide how and when to proceed in order to contribute most
                        effectively to a favorable political environment. We will take into account
                        your view that these measures should be arranged in a manner which avoids
                        the inference that they are in exchange for concessions in the

                        important one. As usual their reasoning is unclear.</p>
                    <p>2. We are doing what we can here to alter that line of thinking, but believe
                        that you and your key officers can do much more there by way of preparing
                        the proper mentality, and would appreciate your help.</p>
                    <p>3. These are the points to be made:</p>
                    <p>(a) The next round can be regarded as a “routine” one. That is, it is the
                        first of many in a new negotiating stage, during which the parties settle
                        down to “steady progress”—neither rapid nor slow but “careful”, and
                        uninterrupted.</p>
                    <p>(b) The objective of this stage is a set of tentative agreements “in concept”
                        on the remaining issues.</p>
                    <p>(c) That objective can only be reached by the negotiators of both parties
                        proceeding into “hard, methodical bargaining”.</p>

                    <p>(d) The basis for such bargaining has now been established by the
                        presentation of Panama’s counter-offer of October 29 to the United States’
                        offer of September 5.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See <ref target="#d102fn3"
                                >footnote 3, Document 102</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Parenthetically, those documents may be too comprehensive and thus too
                        complex to handle as a “package”. Accordingly the United <pb n="272"
                            facs="0297" xml:id="pg_272"/>States would be quite willing to break out
                        components of them to deal with, one after the other.</p>

                    <p>(e) In any case, no “breakthrough” or dramatic negotiating progress should be
                        expected from the next round.</p>
                    <p>(f) Finally and most importantly, the United States’ offer represented a
                        significant movement toward Panama’s positions on many issues.<note n="3"

                        doubt that Panama is in a mood to bargain and, it follows, is not serious
                        about negotiating at this point in history.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador Boyd opened our luncheon conversation with a discussion of United
                        States presidential politics. After commenting that the media in the United
                        States had not been treating President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName> well, Boyd opined the President would be reelected. He
                        then took up the position paper presented by Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> in September.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d104fn2">See <ref target="#d99fn2">footnote 2, Document
                            99</ref>.</note> The current United States position, in Boyd’s view, was
                        directly linked to the coming elections. The paper was one which President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> could point to and say that
                        he is not giving up anything and that there would be a United States
                        presence in Panama for an indefinite period, i.e., perpetuity. This paper
                        had had a terrible negative impact in Panama, reversing the favorable
                        climate that had existed immediately prior to Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s visit. The statements by General
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> and Deputy Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> and the news reports in
                        the United States of a breakthrough in the United States’ position had
                        caused high hopes in Panama.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d97">Document 97</ref>.</note> The new U.S. position made
                        it clear to Panamanians that there had been virtually no progress in the
                        U.S. position and even some retrogression.</p>
                    <p>Boyd said the United States should withdraw its recent position paper in the
                        negotiations because to insist upon maintaining it would cause the
                        negotiations to stall. He feared, however, that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> would be very happy to stick with
                        that negotiating position until late in 1976. This, however, would be a
                        tactical mistake. Absence of progress <pb n="274" facs="0299"
                            xml:id="pg_274"/>on substantive issues would lead to student violence
                        that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> would be politically
                        unable to control. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> was
                        already having difficulty with the economy. This was affecting the political
                        climate. If <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> cannot show
                        progress in the negotiations, he will not have sufficient political
                        justification for taking strong measures against the students. United
                        States’ leaders should understand that any suggestion of an indefinite
                        period for defense means perpetuity as far as the Panamanians are concerned.
                        Such a concept is totally unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>I stressed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> had
                        said that the United States’ position was negotiable. Moreover, I had the
                        impression that Panamanians had not fully understood the United States’
                        position until it had been clarified in subsequent sessions.</p>
                    <p>Boyd said he had recently talked with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Nicolas Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> (on October 24 immediately before
                        the Ambassador had departed for the United States). Nico, he said, was
                        gloomy over the prospects for the negotiations. Minister-Negotiator
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> with whom he had since
                        talked was depressed and saw little hope on the basis of positions which the
                        United States had presented.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after Boyd’s arrival here on Thursday (October 28) he had a long
                        talk with General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>.
                        According to Boyd, when the subject of the negotiations arose, <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> had in a matter of fact way
                        thrown up his hands and said, “Well, what can we do? The present position of
                        the United States is extremely difficult for us.” Boyd then said <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> accepted the necessity of
                        waiting until after the United States’ elections, but he could do so only if
                        real progress was made soon on basic issues.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName> argued that the United States
                        should not seek in its own interest to get defense rights at this time
                        extending beyond the end of the century. To do so would only poison the
                        relationship between the United States and Panama. On the other hand, if the
                        United States would agree to a defense treaty which, along with the treaty
                        for canal operation, would end by the year 2000 a new relationship would be
                        created. During this time the United States could develop the kind of
                        atmosphere in which it could subsequently negotiate an extension of its
                        defense rights in Panama. But to get such a commitment now would be
                        impossible.</p>

                    <p>Boyd commented that he didn’t know whether <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> could keep control of the students during the next
                        year. He commented that he was certain that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> could not control them if the United States’
                        position remained firm that it wanted an indefinite period for the military
                        bases. This brought us around to a discussion of the domestic <pb n="275"
                            facs="0300" xml:id="pg_275"/>political situation in Panama. Boyd
                        acknowledged that the economic situation in the country was bad and getting
                        worse. He said, however, that if it became known that a new treaty were in
                        sight, within six months the economy would be booming again. Bankers would
                        immediately loosen up on their lending. Apart from the National Guard and
                        the National Assembly of Community Representatives (NACR), <persName
                            corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName> said there were five major political
                        groups in Panama today: the old politicians, the private sector, the
                        Catholic church hierarchy, labor unions and the students.</p>
                    <p>The old politicians no longer represented a serious threat. They had shown
                        some opposition immediately after the 1968 overthrow of the Arias regime
                        that was past. They were now sitting and waiting but seemed to lack the
                        courage to take decisive action.</p>
                    <p>The private sector, despite its discomfort with <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> at times had done very well under his government.
                        He had provided stability, despite his increased taxation and despite the
                        rhetoric of his government toward drastic reform had done nothing more
                        drastic than the United States’ New Deal in the 1930’s. The private sector
                        did not feel seriously threatened and therefore would in general support a
                        new treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Catholic church hierarchy had improved its relations with the government
                        since 1961 when church-state relations had reached their nadir. Archbishop
                            McGrath<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">Marcos Gregorio McGrath, Archbishop
                            of Panama.</note> was very capable and would be of help to the General
                        if a new treaty were to be placed before the people.</p>
                    <p>The labor groups also would not pose a serious threat to the government. They
                        were all reasonably docile, had benefitted greatly from GOP policies and
                        were not inclined to challenge <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The students, Boyd said, were the major problem facing the government during
                        the next year. The radical groups were increasingly bold in their opposition
                        to both a new treaty and to the government. As long as <persName

                        be succeeding. Any prolonged stagnation or stalemate in the negotiations
                        would lead to a very dangerous situation for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> and for the treaty negotiations. It was up to the
                        United States, Boyd said, to try to avoid this problem by understanding the
                        imperatives of the Panamanian position and the fact that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> had compromised greatly in
                        agreeing that there would be military bases here.</p>

                    <p>COMMENT: Boyd appears to understand our representations and agreements better
                        than do many other GOP officials, but for him—as for others—Panama’s overall
                        strategy on the canal issue overrides other considerations. Only if they
                        become convinced that their position on UN issues will adversely affect the
                        canal treaty negotiations will they alter positions which they perceive will
                        place pressure on or embarrass the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Two hours before my luncheon conversation with Boyd, the Director of the
                        Foreign Ministry’s Department of International Organizations and Treaty
                        Affairs, Pedro Brin Martinez, had told me Panama would vote for the friendly
                        resolution on Korea and against the hostile resolution,<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d104fn5">U.N. General Assembly Resolutions 3390A and 3390B were
                            two competing resolutions on the reunification of Korea. The United
                            States supported Resolution 3390A. (<hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the
                                United Nations, 1975,</hi> pp. 203–204)</note> but, despite
                        subsequent representations by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1"
                            >Jorden</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>,
                        Panama’s delegation acted as <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>
                        recommended to <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> —it
                        absented itself from the vote.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the canal treaty negotiations, Boyd appeared to place more
                        importance on the duration issue as a problem in the negotiations than on
                        lands and waters. While all Panamanian officials from <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> down insist that 25 years is a
                        maximum duration for any treaty, Boyd is the first person who has suggested
                        to me that the U.S. position paper calling for a 50-year treaty for defense
                        be withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>Boyd’s assessment of the relative support and threat that various domestic
                        groups imply for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> appears
                        fairly accurate.</p>

                    <p>During the evening of November 17 Panama’s highest treaty policy group headed
                        by Vice President <persName corresp="#p_GVG_1">Gerardo Gonzalez</persName>
                        met to discuss the negotiations. Fabian Velarde, who participated in the
                        session, has told me the following:</p>
                    <p>1. Ambassador Gonzalez-Revilla reported his view that the U.S. negotiators
                        were coming without a substantially altered position from that which had
                        previously been presented.<note n="2" xml:id="d105fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>2. After much discussion the group agreed to give Minister-Negotiator
                            <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_GRN_1">Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> broader flexibility than
                        they had had up to the present time. This decision was made in order to
                        obtain movement in the negotiations which would lead to concessions by the
                        U.S.</p>
                    <p>3. The mood of the meeting, however, was “heavy”. The participants were
                        pessimistic about the willingness of the U.S. to negotiate seriously at this
                        time. Members of the group believe that Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has considerably more flexibility
                        than he has used. One person commented “the old man (<persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>) is just playing us along”. The
                        group feared that the U.S. is not prepared to make concessions in the
                        negotiations now because it might cause political problems for President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>. There was some sentiment
                        in favor of suspending the talks.</p>
                    <p>4. Velarde said that many members of the group believe that American
                        officials are coldly calculating—like computers. They think the US has
                        planned out exactly what it wants to achieve and will control the pace of
                        the negotiations to fit the needs of U.S. domestic policies while at the
                        same time seeking to offer Panama just enough to keep quiet. Velarde said he
                        did not share this view, but many of the others held it.</p>
                    <pb n="278" facs="0303" xml:id="pg_278"/>
                    <p>5. It is clear, said Velarde, that not much will be accomplished in this
                        negotiating round. He is worried about what to say to the public after it is
                        over. He reminded me that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        was severely criticized by nationalists after his October 11 speech.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">In telegram 6268 from Panama City, October 11,
                            the Embassy reported that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                                >Torrijos</persName>’ speech contained an “appeal for patience and
                            calm with regard to Canal treaty negotiations.” (National Archives,
                                <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            D750355–0015)</note> The General had not said anything about the
                        negotiations for a long time. He must say something soon. He needs to show
                        some progress. Velarde added, “Do not forget we have December 12 anniversary
                        (of the defeat of the Filos Hines Base Agreement)<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d105fn4">On December 12, 1948, the Panamanian Assembly, under
                            pressure from the public, rejected the Filos Hines Base Agreement which
                            would have allowed the United States to maintain 135 military bases in
                            Panama.</note> and the January 9 anniversary of the 1964 riots to face”.
                        I repeated to Velarde what I had said in a previous conversation: The U.S.
                        was prepared to move ahead with the negotiations, seeking agreement in
                        concept on the major issues within the near future. It was my personal
                        opinion that even by working expeditiously, it would be difficult for the
                        two sides to complete a draft treaty before the end of 1976. The U.S.
                        negotiators needed to obtain some movement from Panama if they in turn were
                        expected to offer concessions.</p>
                    <p>COMMENT: Velarde said he had contributed little to the discussion during the
                        previous evening because of his lack of familiarity with the issues. He
                        prefaced his comments concerning the policy meeting with the words that he
                        did not think he was doing anything unpatriotic by telling me something of
                        the meeting. He felt that communication about mutual problems was extremely
                        important if we were going to succeed in solving the canal issue.</p>
                    <p>I doubt that the policy group understands the distinctions in categories
                        present in the United States position on lands and waters. In my
                        conversations with persons close to the negotiations, they appear to count
                        as gains only those parcels of land that are to be turned over to Panama
                        without restrictions.</p>

                    <p>While waiting for the Secretary this afternoon, I discussed several subjects
                        with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>, including the
                        Panama Canal issue. He remarked that he had spent more time thinking about
                        this single issue than any other foreign policy question in recent years,
                        and that his views on the subject had changed markedly over the past 18
                            months.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">In an October 9 letter to <persName

                            of the negotiations. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                            reply. (Ibid.)</note> The reappraisal of his position was initially
                        brought about as a result of conversations he had with Americans who lived
                        in Latin America and with a few Latin American nationals. These discussions
                        sensitized him to the importance attached to the Canal issue in Latin
                        America. He slowly became convinced of the necessity for the U.S. to make
                        some concessions to defuse the increasingly hostile attitude in the
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> said his own
                        assessment of the strategic importance of the Canal also influenced his
                        position. He then noted that the Canal cannot accommodate the larger ships
                        of our navy and is painfully vulnerable. The scuttling of one ship could
                        close the Canal (this could be accomplished by an act of sabotage and not
                        necessarily by an attack on the Canal). Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GB_1"
                            >Goldwater</persName> also pointed to the unwillingness of the Congress
                        and the people to support the commitment of our armed forces to military
                        operations in support of the Canal.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> thought his constituency was
                        far behind his thinking on the subject and noted that the public would have
                        to be made aware of the complexities of the issue to alleviate public
                        hostility. I mentioned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                        He had not read it but had heard that it was good and considered that sort

                    <p>I asked if the Senator noticed any changes in perception of the Canal issue
                        on the Hill. He responded that <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                        >Byrd</persName>’s decision to withdraw his amendment to the State
                        Appropriations Bill reflected some change. <note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4"

                        He again commented on the problem of information on the issue, stating that
                        “no more than 15% of the Congress” really understands the Canal problem.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> said he favored a gradual

                        of our military presence over a 45-year period.</p>
                    <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> said he hoped that

                        Negotiations. Eyes only for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                    <p>1. After talk with <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> on
                        proposed <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> visit to Washington, reported
                        septel (see Panama 7658),<note n="2" xml:id="d107fn2">Dated December 12.
                            (Ibid.)</note> I told him there was an additional item I wanted to
                        raise. I said that as a result of my recent visit to Washington and after
                        consultations with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        and other colleagues, it was my impression that we were at a propitious
                        moment to move forward on treaty talks with renewed vigor. I said it was my
                        impression that he and perhaps others around him had misinterpreted the
                        oversimplified formula of Quote no treaty before <pb n="281" facs="0306"
                            xml:id="pg_281"/>the U.S. elections Unquote. Perhaps he thought that
                        meant no movement until next November. He said that this was his general
                        impression. I said that was not the way we viewed things at all. I told him
                        I thought the time was ripe for real progress.</p>
                    <p>2. Several things persuaded us in this direction. First, there was always a
                        lot of tension in the air in the period leading up to the January 9
                        anniversary. It put some people in a much more conciliatory mood than at
                        other times. Second, there was no doubt that his coming visit to Cuba<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d107fn3"><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                            visited Cuba January 10–15, 1976. See <ref target="#d110">Document
                                110</ref>.</note> would tend to harden attitudes among some people
                        as I had told him earlier. Third, as we moved into February there would be
                        increasing attention paid to the primary campaigns and the demands of
                        domestic politics. Additionally, I noted that the present cast of characters
                        involved in the treaty problem (including the President, Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and others of us) would not remain
                        in our present positions indefinitely. We might have a new President in
                        January 1977. Without a finalized treaty, Panama would face the prospect of
                        starting from scratch with entirely new personalities and new
                        priorities.</p>
                    <p>3. I said it was my impression that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> wanted to move toward a Quote political transaction
                        Unquote on the remaining outstanding issues in the same way we had moved on
                        earlier issues of jurisdiction, the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>,
                        etc. But to achieve that, he needed to know much more specifically what
                        Panama requires and what it desires. That meant specific proposals discussed
                        back and forth in hard bargaining sessions. It meant the two sides facing
                        each other across the table and talking turkey day in and day out. I said
                        the Ambassador had been forthcoming in the September and November sessions.
                        But all we got from Panama was complaints and mushy words. We needed
                        straight talk and solid justifications for positions from both sides.</p>
                    <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> had been waiting
                        patiently for some response from <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                            >Tack</persName> on our latest proposals. Now we had received a message
                        from <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> that did not say a damn
                        thing new.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">In telegram 293630 to Panama City,

                            33.3–2/Canal Treaty Negotiations/General, July–Dec 1975)</note> It did
                        not move us one inch forward. I said it was possible that the Ambassador’s
                        reaction would be to reply to <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>
                        with a request for harder answers. If he did so, I sincerely hoped that
                        Panama’s reply would be serious and positive. If the existing proposals will
                        not produce a satisfactory treaty, we need to know why not and what will.
                        Only by this approach <pb n="282" facs="0307" xml:id="pg_282"/>can we begin
                        to cut through the fog that has developed around the Panamanian position on
                        outstanding issues.</p>
                    <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said he thought he
                        understood more clearly than ever before. He had really thought we were in a
                        holding pattern over the next months. He said he had a report on the
                        Bell-Gonzalez Revilla talk of the previous day.<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5"
                            >Bell’s account of this meeting is ibid.</note> He said he had
                        authorized Nico to begin developing a Panamanian position which would then
                        be approved here. Then, he thought, Bell and <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1"
                            >Gonzalez Revilla</persName> could sit down together and compare the two
                        positions, U.S. and Panamanian, and begin to seek accommodations. It seemed,
                        he said, that I was talking of something more serious. I assured him I was.
                        My own personal opinion was that there had been too much working separately
                        and then getting together for brief sessions at the top. Would it not be
                        better to think in terms of <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> and
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> getting together
                        for some intensive and detailed discussions—of what Panama wants, what it
                        considers important, and what it truly has to have for a final
                        agreement?</p>
                    <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> asked if I was saying
                        that our negotiators were prepared to really work during the Christmas and
                        New Years holidays. I said that, of course, I could not commit Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. But that it was my
                        impression from Washington that our negotiators were indeed ready to work
                        intensively from now into and through January to get general agreement on
                        outstanding issues. Then we could turn to the lawyers and treaty technicians
                        to begin work on specific treaty language.</p>
                    <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> said I had given him an
                        outlook he had not had before. He took it seriously. He was going to call in
                        today (Friday) <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_GVG_1">Gerardo Gonzalez</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_EBR_1">Romulo Escobar</persName> for a serious discussion on
                        next steps. If they received a message from <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> they would prepare a serious and forthcoming
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> repeated what he had
                        told me before: that he thought these talks should be held in strict privacy
                        and in Washington. I assured him we would accommodate to those wishes.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>1. On Tuesday, 16 December 1975, a high-level group of Panamanians met with
                        the US Negotiators with the objective of reaching—or making substantial
                        progress toward—conceptual agreement on the remaining unresolved major
                        issues in the negotiations. The members of the Panamanian Negotiating Team
                        were:</p>
                    <p>a. Juan Antonio <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> (Foreign
                        Minister and Chief Negotiator).</p>
                    <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Nico Gonzalez-Revilla</persName> (Ambassador
                        to the United States and Deputy Negotiator).</p>
                    <p>c. Rory Gonzalez (Business partner and personal confidant of General
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> —clearly the most
                        powerful member of the team).</p>
                    <p>d. Adolpho Ahumada (Minister of Labor and an attorney).</p>
                    <p>e. <persName corresp="#p_FVE_1">Edwin Fabrega</persName> (Director of IRHE,
                        Panama’s power and light enterprise—a member of the “secret” treaty advisory
                        group).</p>
                    <p>f. <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Carlos Lopez-Guevara</persName> (Prominent
                        Panamanian attorney and legal adviser to the team).</p>
                    <pb n="284" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_284"/>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">General</hi></p>
                    <p>a. The Panamanian Team was very high-powered and had full authority to
                        negotiate for agreement in concept on the remaining issues. This new
                        attitude, or willingness to bargain on all issues, constituted in itself a
                        major change in Panama’s approach toward the negotiations, and provided the
                        US Negotiators an opportunity to probe their position on all issues,
                        individually and collectively, during the course of this round of
                        negotiations. The remaining unresolved major issues in the negotiations at
                        the outset of this round were:</p>
                    <p>(1) Duration (operation)</p>
                    <p>(2) Duration (defense)</p>
                    <p>(3) Related activities</p>
                    <p>(4) Neutrality</p>
                    <p>(5) Expansion</p>
                    <p>(6) Jurisdiction over US civilian employees of the new Canal Administrative
                        Entity</p>
                    <p>(7) Arbitration</p>
                    <p>(8) Compensation</p>
                    <p>(9) Lands and Waters</p>
                    <p>b. The US negotiating position on each of these issues at the beginning of
                        the December 1975 round (as modified by the November 1975 round results),
                        together with the remaining approved fallbacks as of that time, is shown in
                        summary form at TAB A. The results of this round are discussed below,
                        relative to each issue.</p>

                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Land and Water Areas.</hi> This is an area in which the
                        Panamanian negotiating position evidenced marked movement during the
                        December 1975 round. At the first meeting of the negotiating teams, Panama
                        tabled a new proposal on the issue of land and water areas, which was
                        explained by <persName corresp="#p_FVE_1">Edwin Fabrega</persName>. This
                        proposal is depicted graphically by the map (and legend) attached at TAB
                            B.<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        Basically, the proposal involves several different categories of proposed
                        land-use rights, and a timetable for the use rights of certain lands to
                        change during the lifetime of the Treaty. Upon clarification by the
                        Panamanians to the Defense Department members of the Canal Negotiations
                        Support Group, it became clear that although the proposal in its present
                        form was unacceptable to the US, it represented major movement by Panama on
                        this issue, and that the two positions were closer than at any time in the
                        past. Moreover, the time-phased approach held out interesting <pb n="285"
                            facs="0310" xml:id="pg_285"/>possibilities for the United States, in
                        addition to filling the Panamanians’ expressed need for a “living” Treaty,
                        i.e., one involving a process of events over time, visible to the Panamanian
                        people rather than a static Treaty. Also, it became clear during their
                        clarification of the proposal that there was a definite measure of
                        flexibility in their position concerning most land areas of major interest
                        to the US. After the conclusion of the clarification sessions on their land
                        and water proposal, the Panamanian Team proposed a conceptual agreement on
                        the lands and waters issue, which is attached at TAB C.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d108fn3">Tab C, dated December 22, is attached but not
                            printed.</note> While the language of their proposed conceptual accord
                        on lands and waters is unacceptable to the US as it stands, its basic
                        approach warrants serious consideration and offers the possibility of
                        accommodating the present US position in an only slightly modified way.
                        Additionally, the Panamanian Negotiators proposed that the United States
                        make available one representative each from the Panama Canal Company and
                        USSOUTHCOM to participate as active members of the Panamanian Department of
                        Urban Planning. The US team agreed with this proposal.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Duration (operation).</hi> During the November 1975
                        round, the US had met the Panamanian position on the duration of effective
                        US control of the new Canal Administrative Entity. In this most recent
                        round, Panama tabled a proposed Threshold Agreement (TAB D)<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d108fn4">Tab D, dated December 19, is attached but not
                            printed.</note> that, while maintaining 31 December 1999 as the
                        termination date for US operation, proposed a transfer of <hi rend="italic"
                            >control</hi> of the entity to Panama in 1995. This proposal was,
                        however, withdrawn by Panama during the subsequent course of the
                        negotiations. The US Team offered 20 years for operation duration <hi
                            rend="italic">if</hi> Panama would accept 40 years for defense duration.
                        Panama rejected this proposal. <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>: For an
                        issue-by-issue comparison of the US position at the beginning of this round
                        with the Panamanian position tabled in their proposed Threshold Agreement,
                        see TAB E.<note n="5" xml:id="d108fn5">Tab E is attached but not
                            printed.</note></p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Duration (defense).</hi> The proposed Threshold
                        Agreement tabled by Panama during this round (TAB D) proposed a duration for
                        US defense rights of until 31 December 1999, with a provision that no state,
                        other than Panama, would have the right to station troops in Panama after
                        the Treaty’s termination. Subsequently, during the course of the
                        negotiations, Panama agreed to add to that provision the phrase, “except as
                        otherwise mutually agreed by the parties prior to the Treaty’s termination.”
                        Concerning the 40-year duration period proposed by the <pb n="286"
                            facs="0311" xml:id="pg_286"/>United States, however, Panama still would
                        not agree to a defense duration that extended beyond the turn of the
                        century. In this regard, the Panamanian Team indicated only that Panama
                        would <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> a primary defense responsibility of
                        the US that extended beyond the century <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the US
                        would:</p>
                    <p>a. Accept the Panamanian lands and waters proposal made earlier during the
                        round.</p>
                    <p>b. Agree to a shorter period for US operation of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>c. Agree to maintain no <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> military presence in
                        Panama after the year 2000.</p>
                    <p>d. Accept Panama’s position on neutrality (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> no <hi
                            rend="italic">primary</hi> guarantor status for the US beyond the Canal
                        Treaty’s life).</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Related activities.</hi> The Threshold Agreement tabled
                        by Panama proposed that the duration of each of these activities be
                        considered and negotiated individually (see TABS D and E). The US Team
                        accepted this approach. Panama indicated that it was interested in having
                        the US agree to be <hi rend="italic">obligated</hi> to continue certain of
                        these activities (unspecified); the US Team did not, however, respond to
                        this indication. Generally, it was apparent that these activities were not a
                        major concern to Panama.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Neutrality</hi></p>
                    <p>a. Here, as in the issue of defense duration, Panama did not show much
                        flexibility. Their position on this issue, as expressed in their proposed
                        Threshold Agreement (TAB D), is set out in summary form in the spread sheet
                        at TAB E. During the subsequent course of the negotiations, however, Panama
                        did:</p>
                    <p>(1) Agree to add a provision expressly insuring the unimpeded transit of
                        troops, materials of war, and vessels of war, <hi rend="italic">however
                            powered or armed</hi>, of all nations, <hi rend="italic">provided
                            that</hi> nuclear powered or armed vessels may be required to post bond
                        with the Entity or otherwise insure against damage to persons or property in
                        Panama.</p>
                    <p>(2) Caveat their proposed language on the stationing of troops in Panama with
                        language excepting arrangements “otherwise mutually agreed to by the Parties
                        prior to the termination of the [bilateral] Treaty [between the U.S. and
                        Panama].”</p>
                    <p>(3) Agree that no third country other than Panama will operate the Canal
                        after the Treaty’s termination.</p>
                    <p>(4) Clarify their insistence that military vessels of all nations, including
                        the US, be required to pay tolls.</p>
                    <p>b. The US Team responded by proposing that this issue be referred to
                        technical groups of both negotiating teams. This was agreed to by the
                        Panamanians, and, while the ensuing talks at the technical team <pb n="287"
                            facs="0312" xml:id="pg_287"/>level were helpful in probing the
                        Panamanian position on neutrality, they nonetheless stalled on the questions
                        of:</p>
                    <p>(1) The <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> right of the US to guarantee the
                        permanent neutrality of the Canal.</p>

                    <p>(2) Whether US military vessels should be allowed toll-free transit.</p>

                    <p>(3) Whether there would be a bonding, or insurance, arrangement for
                        transiting nuclear powered or armed vessels.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Expansion.</hi> The Panamanian position on expansion
                        embodied in their proposed threshold agreement is set forth in full in TAB D
                        and in summary form in TAB E. Significantly, their new position on expansion
                        represented considerable movement. It grants to the US the <hi rend="italic"
                            >exclusive</hi> right to expand interoceanic canal capacity in Panama.
                        Concerning the <hi rend="italic">definitive</hi> right requested by the US,
                        the Panamanian team wanted to know generally what terms the US wanted
                        definitively set out in the treaty. In response, the US Negotiators offered
                            <hi rend="italic">conditionally</hi> (<hi rend="italic">see</hi> para.
                        14, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>) the provision at TAB F<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d108fn6">Tab F, undated, entitled “New Works/Expansion,” is
                            attached but not printed. The provision reads, in part, “During the
                            treaty period the United States shall have the right to (a) add
                            additional locks to the existing canal, or (b) construct a sea-level
                            canal in Panama.”</note> concerning expansion. In response to this
                        indication, the Panamanian Team “took note that the US offer on expansion
                        seems to be workable.”</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Jurisdiction over US civilian employees of the New Canal
                            Administrative Entity.</hi> Panama’s position on this issue is set out
                        in TAB D. However, the Panamanian Team indicated subsequently that here
                        again, “the U.S. offer seems to be workable.”</p>
                    <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Arbitration.</hi> In the proposed Threshold Agreement
                        tabled by Panama (TAB D), Panama held firm on their position that there be
                        in the new treaty an obligatory obligation to submit all disputes under the
                        treaty to binding arbitration. During the subsequent course of the
                        negotiations, however, Panama fell back to a position that only disputes
                        involving those aspects of the treaty concerning operation of the Canal be
                        subject to obligatory submission to binding arbitration; those aspects of
                        the treaty concerning US defense rights (including the <gloss
                            target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>) would not be the subject of obligatory
                        arbitration. Moreover, the Panamanian Team indicated “that the U.S. offer
                        seems to be workable.”</p>
                    <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Compensation.</hi> Panama proposed a fixed annuity in
                        its proposed Threshold Agreement (TAB D), but both teams agreed that this
                        issue should be put aside until all others are resolved.</p>
                    <p>12. <hi rend="italic">The New Canal Administrative Entity</hi></p>
                    <p>a. The Panamanian Team proposed that the new Canal Administrative Entity be
                        “created jointly by means of the treaty.” Upon clarification <pb n="288"
                            facs="0313" xml:id="pg_288"/>of this proposal, and express reaffirmation
                        by Panama in this connection that effective control of the entity be with
                        the United States, the US Negotiators <hi rend="italic">conditionally</hi>
                            (<hi rend="italic">see</hi> para. 14, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>)
                        agreed to this proposal with the express understanding that effective
                        control would be with the US.</p>
                    <p>b. Also in connection with the entity, the Panamanians asked two questions:
                        First, whether the United States would be agreeable to a clause <hi
                            rend="italic">obligating</hi> the US to maintain the Canal during the
                        Treaty’s life; and secondly, whether Panama would receive control at the end
                        of the Treaty without assuming any liabilities of the entity.</p>
                    <p>c. The US Team also indicated with regard to the Canal Entity that we were
                        prepared to offer Panama an organizational structure that enbodies the
                        principle of a definite minority partnership for Panama in the
                        decision-making and decision-implementing aspects of the Treaty, and offered
                            <hi rend="italic">conditionally</hi> (<hi rend="italic">see</hi> para.
                        14, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>) there would be no “security positions” in
                        the new entity.</p>
                    <p>d. It was agreed that this issue would be an appropriate one to be addressed
                        by technical teams of both countries, sometime in the near future.</p>
                    <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Protection and Defense</hi></p>
                    <p>a. While this subject had not been a major issue in the negotiations, the
                        Panamanian proposed threshold agreement (TAB D) addressed itself to this
                        issue by proposing:</p>
                    <p>(1) That the new treaty shall ensure the increasing participation by Panama
                        in the protection and defense of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>(2) That there be a pre-established level of US Forces on Panamanian
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>(3) That the level shall decrease, in accordance with a process spelled out
                        in the treaty, until eliminated.</p>
                    <p>b. The Panamanian negotiators subsequently changed their proposal in this
                        area to:</p>
                    <p>(1) That the new treaty shall establish the <hi rend="italic">mechanism</hi>
                        which shall permit the increasing participation by Panama in the protection
                        and defense of the Canal (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the “combined Defense
                        Board” already agreed to in the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>).</p>
                    <p>(2) That the level of US Forces shall not exceed the number of Guardia
                        Nacional, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> in cases of conflicts with third
                        countries (with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> process of reducing the level of
                        US Forces spelled out in the treaty.</p>
                    <p>(3) That the Guardia Nacional shall be supplied by the United States, without
                        charge, the same equipment as the US provides to its own troops in
                        Panama.</p>
                    <p>c. I expressed to them that it was unacceptable from the US point of view to
                        have the primary responsibility for protection and defense <pb n="289"
                            facs="0314" xml:id="pg_289"/>of the Canal and at the same time be
                        subject to arbitrary limits on our troop level in Panama. The Panamanian
                        Team suggested that the formula could be modified with, for example, a
                        minimum level to the maximum limit and a broader exception than “conflicts
                        with third countries.” Nonetheless, I expressed that this approach was
                        unacceptable to the United States. I indicated in the alternative, however,
                        that there could be an <hi rend="italic">event</hi>-oriented process for the
                        reduction of the US military presence in Panama, and that the US Team would
                            <hi rend="italic">conditionally</hi> (<hi rend="italic">see</hi> para.
                        14, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>) commit itself to formulate a proposal
                        incorporating such a process.</p>
                    <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Conditional Proposals</hi></p>
                    <p>a. The following US responses to the Panamanian Team were made <hi
                            rend="italic">expressly</hi> conditional on <hi rend="italic">their</hi>
                        acceptance of our position on <hi rend="italic">either</hi>

                        civilian employees of the new entity <hi rend="italic">or</hi> the US
                        position on no obligatory arbitration:</p>
                    <p>(1) Our acceptance of the principle that Panama and the US create the Canal
                        Entity <hi rend="italic">jointly</hi> by means of the Treaty (with the
                        express understanding of Panama that the entity will be under US
                        control).</p>
                    <p>(2) Our acceptance that there will be no “security positions” in the new
                        Canal Entity.</p>
                    <p>(3) Our commitment to formulate an event-oriented process for the reduction
                        of the US military presence in Panama over the life of the Treaty.</p>
                    <p>(4) Our new position on expansion (TAB F).</p>
                    <p>b. In response, the Panamanian Team said it “took note of the conditional US
                        offer, and that the offer seems “workable.”</p>

                    <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Summary.</hi> In summary, this negotiating session
                        succeeded in clarifying the remaining issues. The Panamanian conceptual
                        proposal for handling the lands and waters issue seems to be workable with
                        some modifications. It is clear that further negotiations will be necessary
                        before agreement in concept can be reached on the remaining major
                            issues.<note n="7" xml:id="d108fn7">In a December 22 memorandum to

                    </list>
                    <p>1. On 14 January 1976 Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>
                        hosted a lunch for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>,
                        General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName>. Three matters affecting the Panama
                        Canal Negotiations were discussed. These were: (1) the pace of the
                        negotiations; (2) the continuing defense considerations; and (3) relations
                        with Congress.</p>
                    <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> referred to a message
                        from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> in which
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> described his
                        conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        on the pace of the Panama Canal Negotiations. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> stated that he read into this
                        message a possible speed-up of the negotiations greater than planned or
                            desirable.<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">Possibly a reference to <ref
                                target="#d107">Document 107</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated that in retrospect perhaps
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName> had come on a
                        little too strong. What was desired, however, was to cause the Panamanians
                        to come forth with some concrete proposals. Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated that the Panamanians had
                        considered the US positions in both the September and November sessions as
                        exceedingly hard. This had caused them to feel that the US was not serious
                        in trying to move forward in the negotiations. We wanted to make clear this
                        was not so, that we were prepared to move ahead, but that we wanted some
                        response by Panama to our proposals. However, in the December negotiating
                        sessions, some progress was made.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> emphasized that much work needed to
                        be done before even a conceptual agreement could be reached. He stated that,
                        as a practical matter, it would take at least a year before we could
                        possibly settle on treaty language. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> indicated that he was satisfied with the pace of
                        the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> next raised the
                        question of residual defense. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> commented that the difficulty in this area was the
                        Panamanian fear of disguised perpetuity. However, he felt that the matter
                        might be adequately handled through some type of neutrality agreement. He
                        suggested that we could possibly work out an arrangement where Panama would
                        guarantee the neutrality of the Canal to <pb n="295" facs="0320"
                            xml:id="pg_295"/>the U.S. If this guarantee was not fulfilled, the U.S.
                        would have the right, by treaty, to intervene. This type of neutrality
                        guarantee, coupled with a flexible defense arrangement, could possibly
                        satisfy our requirements.</p>
                    <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> suggested the
                        possibility that we might not want a defense commitment beyond the time that
                        we were responsible for operating the Canal. He stated that when we turned
                        over the Canal, perhaps we should lower our flag and return home. Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> indicated that this was
                        an interesting possibility which we should consider. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> stated that we could, under these
                        conditions, have some type of flexible defense arrangement not necessarily
                        involving any troops on the ground. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> indicated interest in this suggestion.
                        Additionally, General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> said
                        that he was having a study made on the relative value of the Canal which he
                        would pass around.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">Not found.</note> Initial
                        indications are that this study will show that the overall value of the
                        Canal is not too great from a military standpoint.</p>
                    <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> raised the question
                        of the desirability of Congressional visits to Panama. In ensuing
                        discussion, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated
                        that visits to Panama to date have been worthwhile. However, in answer to
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>’ question as to whether
                        or not we should actively encourage both proponents and opponents of the
                        treaty negotiations to go to Panama, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> stated that he thought we should not do so at this
                        time. Instead, we should low-key Congressional visits for the time being.
                        However, if members of Congress wish to visit Panama we should not dissuade
                        them.</p>
                    <p>6. In summarizing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>
                        stated that he thought there were two essential objectives to be achieved by
                        the negotiations: (1) we should insure that the Canal can continue to be
                        operated efficiently without any breakdown when we turned it over to the
                        Panamanians. This should be achieved whatever the time required to prepare
                        the Panamanians to run the Canal. (2) We should have some guarantee of
                        continued neutrality of the Canal. He felt that if these two objectives were
                        achieved, the rest would be relatively unimportant. Without attainment of
                        these two objectives he was sure Congressional approval could not be
                        obtained.</p>
                    <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> referred again to
                        General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>’s suggestion
                        concerning a simultaneous termination of operations and defense commitment
                        and asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> whether
                        he had in mind asking for a revision of the Presidential guidelines if we
                        were to follow this course. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> said he would have in mind doing so.</p>

                        10–15. To the Secretary from Rogers, <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> concurring.</p>
                    <p>1. We have come out of this well.</p>
                    <p>2. Castro counseled <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> to be
                        patient and peaceful in dealing with US on the negotiations. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> publicly accepted that
                        counsel.</p>
                    <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> refrained from endorsing
                        Cuban socialism. He said the two countries were taking different roads to
                        achieve the goal of socio-economic justice. (David Binder, who went along,
                        says that the Panamanians were “shocked” at some of the rigidities they
                        saw). The headlines in Panama the day <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> returned were: “<persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> does not want socialism for Panama.”</p>
                    <p>4. By virtue of this visit <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        undercut domestic-opposition moves from his left. By disassociating himself
                        from socialism he reassured his opponents on the right. By both, he has
                        relieved pressures that could have disturbed the negotiations. (Which, by
                        the way, are going well. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> feels
                        that good progress was made here in December. Another round will be held in
                        Panama in February. <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>, <persName

                    <p>5. The Cuba visit received minimal press coverage in this country.</p>
                    <p>6. The Congress was not, of course, in session. Presumably treaty opponents,
                        and possibly Governor <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>, will
                        exploit <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos'</persName> “Cuba
                        connection”.</p>

                        for Cuba and warned against speaking rashly while there.<note n="2"

                    <p>Despite recent Panamanian declarations that we are nearing conclusion of a
                        Canal treaty, we are actually a long way from completion of an
                            agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">In telegram 551 from Panama City,
                            January 24, the Embassy summarized the reports in the Panamanian media
                            announcing that agreement had been reached to return the Canal to Panama
                            in 1995. (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59,

                            three.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">Presumably a reference to the
                            threshold agreements on jurisdiction, administration, and defense which

                                57</ref>.</note> The five remaining include some of the most
                        intractable issues.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName> has just gone back to
                        Panama to attempt to narrow the differences. He will probably exhaust his
                        present negotiating instructions during the course of these talks and have
                        to return to seek new instructions from the President. Even on an optimistic
                        timetable, <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> does not expect to
                        be able to resolve the outstanding problems before autumn of 1976. At that
                        point the understandings would have to be transformed into treaty language.
                        Therefore, we expect the negotiations to continue in a steady, careful, and
                        undramatic manner during the rest of this year.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Issues</p>
                    <p>To be acceptable any agreement must permit us to retain control of operation
                        and defense of the Canal during the treaty’s lifetime. We are willing to
                        return jurisdiction over the Zone and its population to the Panamanians.
                        Congressional concern will probably center on this return of jurisdiction
                        and the disappearance of the American Government in the Zone and over
                        reversion of the Canal’s operation to the Panamanians at the end of the
                        treaty, towards the end of the century. <pb n="299" facs="0324"
                            xml:id="pg_299"/>The Defense Department is fully engaged in this effort
                        and concurs in the above approach. This affords some protection against
                        charges that an agreement would lessen our military security.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Attitudes</p>
                    <p>Over one-third of the Senate has signed the <persName corresp="#p_TJS_1"
                            >Thurmond</persName> resolution opposing an agreement eventually
                        returning the Canal to Panama, but some of this support appears to be soft.
                        A number of the groups most strongly opposed to a new treaty have indicated
                        they are willing to take another serious look at it. This includes Senator
                            <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName> and the leader of the
                        Veterans of Foreign Wars.<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">See <ref
                                target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note> The U.S. Chamber of
                        Commerce, church groups and big city press all support the negotiations.
                        Nevertheless, we do not under any circumstances want the Canal negotiations
                        to become an issue in the present campaign. It will obviously take time to
                        develop firm support of two-thirds of the Senate even though support appears
                        to be increasing.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Guidance</p>
                    <p>The following is the guidance we have been using in response to stories put
                        out by the Panamanians that a treaty which would turn the Canal over to the
                        Panamanians in 1995 was near completion:</p>
                    <p>—The negotiations are continuing. Some progress has been made but differences
                        remain on a number of important issues. We hope that through careful and
                        steady negotiation we can narrow these differences and ultimately achieve an
                        agreement which protects the interests of both countries in this area.</p>
                    <p>—To questions relating to a possible termination date for the treaty, we have
                        been responding that no agreement has been reached on the termination date
                        of any treaty which might emerge from the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>—With regard to the specific involvement of the President, our position is
                        that the President is of course interested and follows the progress of the
                        negotiations. Specific guidance for negotiations of this kind are
                        established by the President.</p>

                        your cooperation in this. In the present climate, a crisis could cause us to
                        lose everything. Of course, I could be popular if I said we don’t want a
                        treaty. For some reason the Panama Canal issue has people worked <pb n="301"
                            facs="0326" xml:id="pg_301"/>up. I talked to Senator Hart. He supports
                        our position. But he says that in the middle of Colorado people are yelling
                        about the Panama Canal. After the election the President will be in a good
                        position. In the meantime, we should conclude the negotiations. Rogers and I
                        are convinced. I use every opportunity to support the treaty, sometimes in
                        language you don’t like—as the time I answered Wallace’s questions.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">See <ref target="#d99fn6">footnote 6, Document
                                99</ref>.</note> So it is not easy.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: The Panama Canal is a simple
                        problem, but a complex issue. We have to proceed in a statesmanlike way. I
                        fully understand the problem and have no intention of provoking a crisis. We
                        can manage the waiting period. This is fundamental to both countries. What
                        we have to do is proceed on the basis of wisdom toward a solution which is
                        comprehensive. For Panama the problem is not international, but one of
                        national dignity. From our standpoint it is a question of recognizing that
                        the Canal is essential to the US. On the other hand, we hope the US
                        recognizes what Panama needs. It can no longer have territory mortgaged to
                        the Canal Zone. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> is clear on
                        this. The choice of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        is most apt.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: He is a most distinguished diplomat; a man of towering
                        integrity.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: Our problem is historical,
                        based on the manner in which the Canal was built and arrangements made for
                        its operation. Under present arrangements, Panama would concede to the US
                        three things for the life of the treaty: primary responsibility for the
                        administration of the Canal, primary responsibility for the defense of the
                        Canal, and a guarantee that the Canal would remain open on a
                        nondiscriminatory basis to all countries. In agreeing to these, we have met
                        the objectives of the United States. At the same time, Panama’s terms have
                        to do with sovereignty which should be incorporated into the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: These principles are not at issue. The issue is a concrete one. It
                        is the question of defense. It has come to be involved in our domestic
                        policy. We can agree on operation and sovereignty. These are manageable
                        problems. Defense is the one we will have the biggest problem with. We are
                        all decent men, but this is the area where the greatest ingenuity will be
                        needed. If I make public statements on defense, you will have to keep in
                        mind our strategy. If we separate privileges of Canal Zone residents from
                        defense, we can take care of the lobby. No American cares about defending
                        special privileges.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: I have no comment because I
                        like the way you say it. The privileges are very significant because they
                        give a colonial character <pb n="302" facs="0327" xml:id="pg_302"/>to the
                        Zone. The military problem can be handled. You have done this with others in
                        a <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Mr. Secretary, you
                        want to make a distinction between golf courses, theatres, and stores, on
                        the one hand, and workers’ rights and benefits on the other.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: Yes, these are details. There
                        is a conceptual problem we should be aware of. There will be an agreement
                        which we will sign. The Canal will be returned to us at the end of the
                        treaty. Panama agrees to the right of use for operation and defense of the
                        Canal. We have a problem which came up at the recent stage in the matter of
                        defense rather than operation. There is a contradiction between the
                        sovereign rights of Panama and the rights of use to be granted to the United
                        States. We believe that user rights pertaining to land and waters should at
                        no time contradict the disappearance of the Canal Zone. This is the basic
                        problem we addressed.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: What is the concrete issue question?</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary Rogers: We have not talked with <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, so we have no report on the latest
                        round.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: It is a bit intricate. I only
                        wanted to convey to you my concern.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: If you state it as a principle, the essence of which is the
                        disappearance of the Canal Zone, we have no interest in evading that
                        principle. If we can agree on the defense question, we can work out a
                        practical arrangement.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: The Ambassador has the details,
                        but I wanted you to think about this. It is something we cannot keep in
                        isolation. It will spread. We still have to solve duration, expansion, new
                        facilities, and terms of civilian employees.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: (To Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>) Is
                        that what you were talking about?</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: But you think we are making progress.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: In a sense the differences have
                        been delineated and in some cases narrowed. We are aware we cannot expect to
                        conclude an agreement prior to the election in November, but we would ask
                        you if we can keep up our progress and your interest in the talks.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: As long as there is no publicity, we can work. We can complete an
                        agreement conceptually by the end of the year. There will be some drafting,
                        but we can begin the campaign for ratification even while the drafting is
                        going on. By January or February next year, it will become an American
                        domestic problem and not yours. This is the schedule we are working on.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: We understand perfectly. In
                        international diplomatic meetings, of course, we will have to bring the
                        matter up. There will be a <pb n="303" facs="0328" xml:id="pg_303"/>meeting
                        of Latin American presidents here in June, and then in September the
                        Non-Aligned meeting will take place in Sri Lanka. We will participate and
                        mention the problem.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: It will help if in June the heads of state can say that they think
                        it is urgent that a new treaty be worked out, and that they are satisfied
                        that the negotiations are going on, without congratulating us or even saying
                        that the negotiations are going well because we would be asked why. If Latin
                        Americans say it is urgent, that might be helpful, but if the Non-Aligned
                        say it, it would be negative. Most Americans are sick and tired of the
                        Non-Aligned. Moynihan represents American public opinion. Be careful of what
                        happens in Sri Lanka. I will spend months stressing the importance of Latin
                        American relations. My trip has been positive (despite the press). If in
                        June the presidents of the Americas say it is important that a treaty be
                        completed and that the negotiations are going on, we can use it. In Sri
                        Lanka be careful if the Arabs get involved. That might put the whole thing
                        in the middle of another argument. If <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName> runs against <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                            >Jackson</persName>, I make no promises on a deadline. Eventually, of
                        course, both would be forced to do it.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: I always dislike wasting your
                        time. This is a good conversation, but you should be aware of two problems.
                        First, we must try to have a duration which is acceptable to us both. It is
                        very important that the treaty terminate in a way that is acceptable to both
                        countries, and we must work hard and as rapidly as we can.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: This is the most difficult problem.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: Second, I remember when we met
                        in Washington the Secretary said to me that in negotiating a treaty, where
                        there is a political will, treaties can be concluded in a week.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d113fn5">See <ref target="#d40">Document 40</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Secretary: My view is that every bureaucratic problem can be resolved in a
                        certain two-hour period (I modified that to six hours) and every treaty can
                        be negotiated in a week—after the election.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: After November?</p>
                    <p>Secretary: The end of November or the middle of December. I am disposed to
                        conclude rapidly after the election. In the meantime, you and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> continue to work hard.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: This is significant. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> agreed that after he
                        returned to Washington we would maintain contact. I am at your disposal for
                        any time that you would like a meeting to take place.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: I am going to try to keep myself out of this but will follow it
                        closely. If I get involved, everyone will think that a treaty is near to
                        being concluded. What are we going to say to the press? Shall we <pb n="304"
                            facs="0329" xml:id="pg_304"/>say that we reviewed the status of the
                        negotiations; that you concluded recent negotiations with <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>; that you will continue the talks
                        with <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>: Yes.</p>
                    <p>(End of Meeting)</p>

                    <p>We returned to Washington Sunday night from 14 days of talks on Contadora.
                        Our negotiating purposes this time were to consolidate the progress from the
                        December round, and to probe Panama’s position on various issues so as to
                        narrow the gaps between us.</p>
                    <p>The round was fruitful. But we are still some time away from being able to
                        report to the President that, with certain specific changes in guidance, the
                        conceptual basis for a treaty is at hand.</p>
                    <p>During the round I met with <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> five
                        times—twice formally with our full teams in attendance and three times
                        privately. At his request, however, all but two of the ten formal meetings
                        were without the Chief Negotiators in attendance. (<persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>, we were told privately, would be too
                        impatient to address the remaining issues except in broad conceptual terms.
                        With him in attendance the Panamanian team would be too inhibited to address
                        the issues in detail.) I agreed to the procedure but stressed that I did not
                        wish to establish a precedent. Minister Bell presided for our side,
                        Gonzalez-Revilla for Panama’s.</p>
                    <p>The discussions were freer ranging than ever before. Both sides conveyed to
                        each other their concerns, needs and realities. Early in the talks we
                        explained that we were past the stage where we could make major
                        breakthroughs using present guidelines and positions. We explored, without
                        commitment, possible solutions on a “what if” and <pb n="305" facs="0330"
                            xml:id="pg_305"/><hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> basis. We stressed
                        that we were not making proposals, but merely attempting to find formulae
                        which could be considered after we returned to Washington.</p>
                    <p>Principal topics of discussion concerned the issues of lands and waters,
                        duration, the Canal entity and civilian employees.</p>
                    <p>On the <hi rend="italic">lands and waters</hi> issue, we made satisfactory
                        progress both at the Negotiator and working group levels. Both sides have
                        agreed to approach the lands and waters issue as a process of reduction,
                        over time, of the area comprising the Canal Zone, but have not agreed yet on
                        a paper describing this process. The Panamanians substantially changed their
                        position by accepting the idea of using a “Spanish bases” type formula to
                        place military family housing and the Empire and Sherman training areas
                        under the <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>. After Panama put its
                        revised position on a large scale map, Tom <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"
                            >Dolvin</persName> committed us to responding at the next session with a
                        revised map of the US position. Hopefully, this will narrow the gap
                        further.</p>
                    <p>We probed hardest on the <hi rend="italic">duration</hi> issue. Panama
                        “definitively rejected” our “20–40” formula, and proposed, instead,
                        that:</p>
                    <p>—in 1990 it would assume control of the operation of the Canal;</p>
                    <p>—in 1999 the presence of US military forces in Panama would end; and</p>
                    <p>—in 2005, the US responsibility for the protection and defense of the Canal
                        would end.</p>
                    <p>We countered with a series of “what if” questions concerning a modified
                        “20–40” formula that would provide for:</p>
                    <p>—the elimination of combat forces when we transfer responsibility for the
                        Canal to Panama; and</p>
                    <p>—the retention of US defense rights plus a manned US logistics base for an
                        additional 20 years.</p>
                    <p>At our final meeting the Panamanians pressed us to convert our duration
                        formula into precise dates, but we declined. They indicated that their
                        previous offer exceeded their guidance and that they could not agree to any
                        formula which involved any type of US presence after the year 2000. However,
                        when our team further pursued the matter of a logistics base, the
                        Panamanians declined to rule out future discussion along the lines of the US
                        suggestion.</p>
                    <p>Our talks on the nature of the new <hi rend="italic">Canal Entity</hi> were
                        useful, if inconclusive. While avoiding examination of the functions that
                        the Entity should have, we explored the possibility of jointly creating it
                        by treaty in a manner that would allow direct Congressional control. While a
                        solution has eluded us so far, several of the Panamanians, including two of
                        their most influential members, made efforts to find a formula that would
                        satisfy us and ease their political problem. <pb n="306" facs="0331"
                            xml:id="pg_306"/>Throughout the discussions we impressed upon the
                        Panamanians the high importance that the US Congress will place upon the
                        nature of the Canal Entity, and the unlikelihood that the Congress would
                        accept any dimunition of its powers concerning the Entity.</p>
                    <p>A fourth issue which drew attention concerned <hi rend="italic">civilian
                            employees.</hi> Early in the round the Panamanians proposed that they
                        accept our position on arbitration if we, in turn, would accept their
                        position on Canal employees—that is, respect for employee labor gains, but
                        without <gloss target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss> benefits (e.g., immunity for
                        official duty acts, commissary privileges, etc.) Our team rejected this
                        proposal. We tried, however, to explore the issue in detail, and presented
                        orally a list of benefits drawn from those provided in the <gloss
                            target="#t_SOFA_1">SOFA</gloss>. But Panama refused to enter into a
                        detailed discussion.</p>
                    <p>Turning to unilateral actions, President Lakas raised with me and Morey—and
                        subsequently <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> raised—the
                        desirability of the US releasing to Panama, by executive agreement and
                        before the treaty enters into effect, selected Canal Zone sites for
                        Panamanian commercial development. They want:</p>
                    <p>—the Navy pipeline;</p>
                    <p>—Las Bocas drydock;</p>
                    <p>—a part of Balboa port for loading/unloading vessels</p>
                    <p>—portions of Albrook “recently vacated and . . . at present unused;” and</p>
                    <p>—the Coco Solo port/wharf area.</p>
                    <p>Since I had prior Defense clearance on the pipeline I indicated that we were
                        prepared to discuss its use by Panama, and proposed that the action be
                        referred to the recently authorized Joint Committee on Commercial
                        Activities. We are moving carefully, however, on the other items in the
                        Panamanian proposal. Both sides have felt constraints which in the past have
                        prevented agreement on similar proposals.</p>
                    <p>As for next steps, we will be focussing with Defense on the key issues of
                        duration, neutrality, the functions of the Entity and lands and waters. We
                        ended our talks with the Panamanians on Sunday without agreeing on a
                        definite date for a new round but with the understanding that both sides
                        needed to assess the results of this round and prepare carefully for the
                        next. That will take some weeks of effort.</p>

                            IN THE COMING MONTHS</p>
                        <p>Since the resolution of the State/Defense differences and the resulting
                            change in presidential negotiating instructions last August,<note n="4"

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has followed a
                            course of negotiation which can be characterized as steady but measured,
                            and unobtrusive.</p>
                        <p>That course has been dictated by the fact that the two teams have now
                            reached the most delicate and complex issues in the negotiations, and by
                            the need to keep the negotiations as removed as possible from the
                            domestic political scene in both countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> believes that by
                            following this course it will not be possible to finish the negotiation
                            until late this year—if, indeed, it proves possible to conclude a new
                            treaty with Panama at this point in history which adequately protects
                            United States interests yet is adequately attentive to Panama’s.</p>
                        <p>Both negotiating teams are cautiously optimistic on that score, at this
                            writing.</p>
                        <p>Panama, while it would welcome speedier negotiations, seems to acquiesce
                            in that timetable. (Intelligence reports reflect a desire on <persName
                                corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ part that the President go
                            to Panama at some point following our elections to observe the signing
                            of a treaty, which might then be presented to the Congress at the first
                            session in 1977.)<note n="5" xml:id="d115fn5">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p>Though acquiescing, Panama will not relax its pressures on the United
                            States to maintain that timetable for—and to make substantive progress
                            in—the negotiations. Those pressures will be applied chiefly through
                            international gatherings (the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                            General Assembly in early June in Santiago; the scheduled meeting of
                            Chiefs of Latin Governments later that month in Panama City; the
                            Non-Aligned Group’s meetings in Colombo in August; the UN meetings
                            beginning in September—with Panama sitting again on the Security
                            Council).</p>
                        <p>Consonant with the steady but measured negotiating course, there were
                            negotiating rounds in Panama in September, October and November; in
                            Washington (a secret one) in December; and a lengthy one, <pb n="309"
                                facs="0334" xml:id="pg_309"/>again in Panama, in February. The
                            Ambassador anticipates that the next round will take place in Panama in
                            early May. Technical-level talks may precede it. Possibly there would be
                            another round in late May or during June, locale uncertain.</p>
                        <p>This hiatus between the February round and the prospective round in early
                            May results from the fact that State and Defense are reexamining the
                            specifics of the United States’ positions on major issues. Part of that
                            reexamination process has been Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                                >Bunker</persName>’s direct consultations with the Joint Chiefs of

                                    >Bunker</persName> met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on March 5
                                to discuss the upcoming negotiations, focusing on duration of U.S.
                                rights, lands and waters, civilian employees, and nuclear safeguards

                        <p>Both Departments believe that it may be in order for them to return to
                            the President for revised instructions—as he invited—before negotiating
                            rounds subsequent to those held in May-June. Timing is difficult to
                            predict, but the Ambassador does not now anticipate returning to the
                            President before, say, the late summer. He hopes to be able to present,
                            again, unified State/Defense recommendations.</p>
                        <p>In the period before the May-June round, and intermittently thereafter,
                            the Ambassador wishes to undertake the consultations in the Congress
                            which the President instructed and which, if not undertaken at this
                            stage of the negotiation, will result in great problems for the
                            Executive Branch later, when a treaty is at hand.</p>
                        <p>These would consist of one-on-one private interviews with approximately
                            10–12 members of the Senate and 10–12 of the House.</p>
                        <p>A few of these in each body would be the leaders. The Ambassador has seen
                            them before on the treaty matter, and seeing them again would be
                            designed to bring them up to date.</p>
                        <p>The remainder in the two bodies would encompass members whom the
                            Ambassador has not before consulted, but who seem to be both interested
                            in the Canal matter and in a position to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mere “consultation” is not the only objective. The Ambassador will be
                            seeking also the Members’ counsel on (a) the “shape” of a possible
                            treaty package, and (b) the strategy and tactics involved in moving any
                            Panama treaty through the complete congressional processes, including
                            the timing.</p>
                        <p>Because these visits to Members must be fitted around both the
                            negotiating rounds and the congressional recesses scheduled from now
                            through the National Conventions and thereafter, it is prudent to begin
                            them now.</p>

                    <p>Senator Johnston: What are your views on the Panama Canal?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Let me explain. This is not just a matter between us and
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> —as often presented.
                        It concerns all of Latin America. A refusal to discuss the issue could
                        undermine our relations with the other Latin American nations. I know of no
                        one who knows Latin America who does not foresee some sort of guerilla
                        action. Riots, upheaval. Every country would be against us—well, maybe not
                        Paraguay or Bolivia. This is the only issue that could turn them all against
                        us. There is nothing we would be able to do. Last year <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> made an effort to have six Latin
                        American Presidents enter the Zone with him. We headed it off at the last
                        minute. All our friends have told us. There is no country where this
                        wouldn’t happen. Mexico? Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1"
                            >Goldwater</persName> went to Mexico. The President told him they’d send
                        the army to Panama. Barry changed his mind.<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Senator Brock: So have I.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We will give up some things—like water rights, but we will
                        retain defense rights. We seek some formula to get us through the useful
                        life of the Canal—40 years. In fifteen years, of course, all hell could
                        break loose but then it would be us and the Panamanians and it would be a
                        new treaty not the old treaty. Other countries like Britain and Suez had the
                        same thing. And I note that Panama is the same distance from here as Suez
                        from England. Let’s wait for the treaty. We’ll keep the defense operations
                        and give up the irritating features. It will be a year and then we’ll have a
                        consent agreement for a treaty—then we’ll have to paragraph it and work it
                        out and that’s another long stretch.</p>
                    <p>Senator Domenici: Let me make a few remarks. Senator Cranston and I may have
                        to leave. Thank you for meeting with us. A number of us not on the Foreign
                        Relations or Armed Services committees feel—and we’ve told you—we want to
                        share ideas and exchange views. We only see you occasionally. I invited
                        these gentlemen as a chance to get your views. Would you conclude that if we
                        don’t endeavor to keep the negotiating spirit alive that the effort to get
                        closer to Latin America will be in vain.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: That is my judgment and that of all the other leaders that
                        I’ve met.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MTE_1">Morgan</persName>: I was approached by
                        the Ashford Morning Seminar. They were adamant. I told them to send a
                        committee down. Some <pb n="312" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_312"/>Legionnaires
                        went. If some civic leaders were sent there it would be good.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: An excellent idea. Maybe we could do it when the treaty is
                        further advanced.</p>
                    <p>Senator Brock: If we could get some Legionnaires. The commander in Tennessee
                        and one or two other states. Three commanders, a small trip, not big. I’m
                        goldarned sure it would help. I’m okay if I keep the VFW off my back. As a
                        politician I know that no issue is more important to the Latin Americans
                        than the Panama Canal. You talk to an Argentinian—this is essential to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: This is the test of US commitment.</p>
                    <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_MTE_1">Morgan</persName>: The average American
                        just doesn’t know how much we have there.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: And what is our alternative? To keep the 82nd Airborne there?
                        And 15,000 Panamanians work in the Zone.</p>
                    <p>Senator Stone: Have you considered presenting us with two segments of the
                        treaty? First the financial; second the social issues; third the general
                        economic issues. Leaving sovereignty, the ultimate transfer to last. Instead
                        of putting it all in one package. If you gave us just the rent first we
                        could get a rhythm of approval established; we could avoid <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Would the Senate do that.</p>
                    <p>Senator Brock: It would sail through.</p>
                    <p>Senator Stone: It gets us into a rhythm.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I don’t know if we’ve finished anything yet.</p>
                    <p>Senator Cranston: Would Allen and Helms filibuster?</p>
                    <p>Senator Stone: I talked to Allen. It’s not the rent or the work opportunity
                        provisions. It’s these other things. Give us one or two revisions and we’d
                        pass through. Why not get it out of the campaign. Bipartisan
                        ratification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: It never occurred to me that it could be done.</p>
                    <p>Senator Stone: I told <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>. And the
                        other man, the former Ambassador to the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>
                        what’s his name?</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We’ll look into it. I just don’t know what the President’s
                        ideas would be—about a debate.</p>
                    <p>Senator Stone: There’d be no debate.</p>

                        close and friendly relations between Panama and the United States and hoped
                        that he and Ambassador would stay in close communication and thereby avoid
                        or minimize problems. His record over the years, he said, showed that he was
                        pro-American. His public criticism of 1903 treaty relationship had been and
                        would be necessary to assure that sufficient “heat” be generated to prevent
                        weakening of current US efforts to negotiate a new treaty. He would do his
                        utmost to bring treaty negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                    <p>2. During discussion of US political scene, Boyd expressed full understanding
                        of US need for low profile on progress of treaty negotiations during coming
                        months, but hoped that US officials would con<pb n="314" facs="0339"
                            xml:id="pg_314"/>tinue efforts to inform US public of need for a new
                        treaty. He said he and his Ministry would continue close cooperation with
                        Embassy in briefing US visitors and journalists. On April 6, he had spent an
                        hour with group of 20 persons representing US National Council of
                        Churches.</p>
                    <p>3. Boyd showed concern about Cuban activities in Africa and implications for
                        Latin America. He asserted that GOP and US Embassy should closely monitor
                        Cuban activities in Panama.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">COMMENT:</hi> Boyd was very cordial in conversations. He
                        made clear he wanted amicable relationships with US officials and with US
                        treaty negotiators. We gained impression that he is sincere in his intention
                        to work with United States officials toward new treaty relationship in open
                        and cordial manner.</p>

                    <p>Following a discussion in which the Panamanians went over with me their notes
                        of the last two sub-group’s sessions on lands and waters during the previous
                        week, <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> asked if I could
                        meet him later for a drink at his apartment. After my arrival at his home he
                        said he was concerned about political developments and the negotiations. He
                        was not going to talk, he said, about Panama’s nationalistic feelings
                        concerning the Canal nor the need for United States to enter into a <pb
                            n="315" facs="0340" xml:id="pg_315"/>treaty. These things he knew I
                        understood. He wanted to talk, however, about a much, much broader political
                        panorama and of the future.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> said that he and many other
                        educated Panamanians recognized that the United States has a fundamental
                        interest in defending the Western Hemisphere. It has worldwide commercial
                        responsibilities and special responsibilities concerning the efficiency and
                        availability of the Panama Canal to the world. Two key elements in this are
                        good management and protection of the Canal. The United States is the main
                        user and has the responsibility for carrying out these guarantees. Other
                        nations expect the United States to exercise these responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>The negotiations with Panama have been an instrument for the United States to
                        develop and improve the political and moral basis for exercising these
                        responsibilities. The negotiations have been therefore a necessity for the
                        United States, but for Panama, treaty negotiation is a much more profound
                        matter. Negotiation is not only aimed at perfecting Panama’s national
                        independence and restoring Panama’s national dignity. More importantly, the
                        treaty will be a way for Panama to assume many of the responsibilities that
                        the United States carries out. Thus the treaty is the means of modernizing
                        Panama.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> continued, saying that
                        Panamanians have a much broader concept of developing and using the Canal
                        than does the U.S. True, we will probably not run it as well in a very
                        specific fashion, however, Panamanians love the Canal and would use many
                        Americans in its operation at least initially. The initial plans discussed
                        at the technical level would mean to build double channels to the locks,
                        provide more tugs, and thus increase traffic capacity considerably.</p>
                    <p>But the negotiations are failing as a means of achieving a treaty designed to
                        modernize Panama because of the way in which they are being conducted by the
                        GOP. It is not planning for modernization of the country. It is thinking in
                        much shorter-term political objectives. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> is afraid of modernization. The National Guard
                        General Staff is already afraid things have gone too far. They will find
                        ways to obstruct this process. The reason for their fear is that
                        modernization would mean a shift of power in Panama from <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and the present National Guard
                        General Staff to “technicians” (i.e., executives, engineers, economists,
                        young <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> officers, etc.) who would assume
                        responsibilities in cooperation with the United States for operating the
                        Canal and developing a complex economy associated with Panama’s role as a
                        transit and service center.</p>
                    <p>The balance of political power in Panama is very fluid. The <gloss
                            target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss>’s top level, including <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and the National Guard General
                        Staff, is nervous. The United States’ negotiators will need a good deal of
                        understanding and public relations skill to deal with such “ignorant
                        people”.</p>
                    <pb n="316" facs="0341" xml:id="pg_316"/>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> believes the United States
                        is weak. He believes there are many centers of power in the United States
                        which affect the negotiations. In his view, one power group is in the
                        ascendancy one weekend, and the next week it is replaced by another. He also
                        does not believe that the United States will support Panama’s nationalistic
                        goals which meted [<hi rend="italic">looked</hi>?] towards greater
                        independence from the United States. The United States must try to somehow
                        educate him into a better perception of its goals, its power, and its way of
                        doing things. He simply does not understand how the U.S. Government and
                        society functions.</p>
                    <p>The idea of unilateral concessions is a disaster. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> is seeking them as a way of
                        avoiding taking decisions on the major issues in the negotiations. His
                        technicians have advised him not to waste time on them, but he has ignored
                        their advice.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> then mentioned the
                        relationship between <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. While <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> respects <persName
                            corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName> they have a reserved
                        relationship. <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName> is a
                        “technician” who is extremely intelligent and sophisticated. <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> does not understand complex
                        ideas and is uneasy in the company of intelligent men.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> argued that the United
                        States in the negotiations should try to stimulate the interests of the
                            <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss> General Staff in “things,” that is
                        houses, military technology and other rather specific concepts. They will
                        then feel they are participating in the negotiations and will see benefits
                        for themselves. Panama is far from having reached the stage that Iran and
                        Egypt have reached, that is, the stage in which they recognize that their
                        natural ties and interests lie with the United States. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> is avowedly pro-American. The
                        challenge for the United States therefore, said <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1"
                            >Velasquez</persName>, is not only to modernize the treaty relationship
                        but also to negotiate a treaty that will modernize Panama. Panama must be
                        careful to negotiate a treaty that is not limited to the rectification of
                        the problems and resentments of the past but would also lead to the
                        modernization of attitudes and the maturing of Panama. Such a treaty would
                        shift responsibilities to Panamanians in an orderly fashion. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> said the U.S. negotiators would
                        have to do this because, through design or inadvertency, <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and the National Guard will not
                        negotiate such a treaty.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> stressed that when General
                            <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> meets General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> during his next visit to Panama,
                        he should stress that there is one man, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, in charge of the negotiations and
                        that we are operating with unity. <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"
                            >Dolvin</persName> has the prestige to impress upon <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> the necessity of working in a
                        systematic manner toward a new relationship. Panamanians regard him as a
                        very skillful and positive factor in the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>President Lakas must be taken into account and used in helping to develop the
                        new relationship with Panama. The banks trust him, <pb n="317" facs="0342"
                            xml:id="pg_317"/>and the economic structure of Panama is depending upon
                        the banking sector, upon commerce and upon the Panama Canal. If <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> does not affect these three
                        things Panama will survive. Lakas is a defender of this system. Vice
                        President Gonzalez must be regarded as an impediment to the new
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> destroyed <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>’s influence over the period of a year
                        and a half by gradually cutting back his authority and humiliating him. The
                        Panamanian negotiators are now working without instructions. They have no
                        coherent instructions on which to go to the next level in the negotiations;
                        therefore, the U.S. initiative must be intelligent and forceful. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> was a representative of the
                        technicians. He was of humble (“popular”) origin and had been building a
                        nationalistic political base. The Security Council meeting here in March of
                        1973 was the peak of his political influence. He had presidential ambitions.
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> recognized this, and
                        therefore he placed his brother Marden <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> in the Foreign Ministry to watch <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> and to obstruct him. After Marden
                        left the Ministry, Darien Ayala was placed in the Ministry for the same
                        purpose. Ayala was generally stupid, but he followed instructions.
                        Essentially his role was to obstruct the professionals. <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName> has learned that it was dangerous to
                        be intelligent. There is persecution against intellectuals.</p>
                    <p>The National Guard is not informed concerning the state of the negotiations.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName> and others are
                        concerned over this. Prior to the last set of discussions at the subgroup

                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> Government is shared
                        by a number of young well-educated men in the middle levels of government
                        who look with disdain on the political game that is carried on by <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and the General Staff. They
                        regard the “politicians” as ignorant and capable of actions damaging to
                        Panama. <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> and <persName

                        negotiate a satisfactory treaty with Panama. They want both sides to ensure
                        that the treaty does not merely eliminate the political problems and
                        grievances of the past and present, but that it structure a future living
                        relationship in which the Canal and the U.S. presence are used to modernize
                        Panama. They fear <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> would
                        sacrifice this for short-term political gains.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: He thought it was all off the record.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, there is
                        no such thing as off the record.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: You know that; I know that. But he was nice to the Committee.
                        They swore to him that it would be absolutely protected and not
                        released.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: First, we can’t
                        protect Top Secret papers. Why should we be able to protect Congressional
                        hearings? And, secondly, why couldn’t he stick to the formulations we’ve

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: To “Are we going to give it away?” he said, “Yes.”</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then why
                        couldn’t he put it on the basis of “We don’t know what it’s going to be
                        until we have the negotiation completed”?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Of course. And then we’re not giving away anything; we’re
                        protecting our interests. There are a lot of ways he could have answered it
                        better than he did. The answer is he was lulled into it, like a witness is
                        lulled into a cross-examination.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Everybody is
                        thinking he can protect himself with his constituency. He’s created a
                        massive problem for the President for no reason whatsoever and for us,
                        because in order to pick ourselves out now we have to say so many things
                        that are going to come back to bite us in Latin America that it’s a massive
                        problem.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: You bet it’s a massive problem, but we ought to be honest about
                        it. Half of the problem is the President’s—what he said in Dallas<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d120fn3">In an April 10 news conference in Dallas, President

                            administration would cede control of the Canal, stating instead: “I can
                            simply say—and say it very emphatically—that the United Sates will never
                            give up its defense rights to the Panama Canal and will never give up
                            its operational rights as far as Panama is concerned.” He concluded: “I
                            can assure everybody in the United States that we will protect defense
                            and operational responsibilities as far as the Panama Canal is

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (A), we’re
                        protecting our interests. Anytime anybody asks the question, I give a long
                        explanation of what the problem is. Then they have to fight the problem
                        rather than the specific negotiating position. All he has to do is explain
                        the problem and say, “We’re not sure how it’s going to come out. We’re
                        protecting our rights in defense. What that is we don’t know until we
                        complete the negotiation.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: That’s the line I’ve been following. I was dumbfounded.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But how can
                        people just go up there without telling anybody?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: No. The hearing we heard about for a long time. The hearing they
                        called about a month and a half ago, but it was stalled. They had Vessey up,
                        they had Marty Hoffman up; there were three days of hearings. <persName

                        thing. And we prepared a statement for him that, you know, was down the
                        line, with no problems in it. But it was cross-examination. <persName

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but it’s
                        not that <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> is a Junior

                    <p>Mr. Rogers: No. He made a mistake; there’s no question about that. The
                        reasons I’m giving you—(1), he was—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Because if you
                        think what the President said in Dallas was bad, you wait and see what he
                        says the next time he goes down there.</p>

                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He was going to
                        talk about defense, that we were going to maintain the defense. I made him
                        change it to interests in defense. But if you think you can get that settled
                        in a day of campaign speeches, you’re crazy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: No; it’s a messy problem.</p>
                    <p>If there’s anything else we can do about it we will do it, but I can’t think
                        of anything.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can keep
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: It’s the first preaching we’ve had on him.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But it was
                        absolutely predictable.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: It wasn’t predictable.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It was
                        predictable in that it would happen once he said what he said.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Of course, but the prepared statement that we had arranged—and I
                        followed the whole line that we’ve been following right down through
                        here—</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In fact [giving]
                        the Canal to Panama is already the wrong way of stating it, because we
                        haven’t got it to give.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: That’s what I say. <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        made the first mistake.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So he shouldn’t
                        have accepted the question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rogers: Correct—never accept the questioner’s formulation. Never say yes
                        or no. Never get trapped into that formula—that’s the first principle.

                    <p>Attached is Colonel <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Donovan</persName>’s
                        memorandum on the Panama Canal,<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">The memorandum,
                            dated May 11, entitled “The Panama Canal Issue,” is attached but not
                            printed.</note> which includes the Statement of Principles agreed upon
                        by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and the
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Panama. Colonel <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJ_1">Donovan</persName> believes that we should stress that
                        our negotiations with Panama should insure <hi rend="italic">security</hi>
                        of the Canal, its <hi rend="italic">availability</hi> for civil and military
                        purposes to the United States, and the <hi rend="italic">efficient</hi>
                        operation of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>You have already stressed that the “in perpetuity” language should be
                        removed, and this is covered by the Statement of Principles.</p>
                    <p>Also, the $2.3 million dollars per year we pay Panama should be adjusted
                        upward.</p>
                    <p>One tack to take is to stress that while the Panama Canal is vital to our
                        national interest and while its security is critical, one of the best ways
                        to assure its security and availability is to have peaceful relations with
                        the country in which the Canal is located. Nothing could be more
                        counterproductive than to have guerilla warfare or a continuing irritant in
                        our relations with the country in which the Canal is located.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>During the past week a number of people have asked me for guidance on
                        continuing the Canal negotiations, indicating some difference between
                        them.</p>
                    <p>On the one hand, both <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Ellsworth Bunker</persName>
                        and Tom <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> have explained that
                        they were operating on a “business as usual” basis but were getting no
                        cooperation from the Army (<persName corresp="#p_VVV_1">Veysey</persName>
                        and Hoffman). To both of them I said I understood the guidance as continuing
                        careful and deliberate negotiations, recognizing that agreement was not
                        possible before 1977.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_VVV_1">Vic
                                Veysey</persName>, former Congressman and presently Assistant
                            Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, has called me in alarm at what he
                            considers the “flurry” of activity by the negotiators.</hi> He quite
                        clearly wishes we had never gotten into the negotiations and does not want
                        to provide the negotiators with the materials they have requested on
                        specific negotiating issues.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VVV_1">Veysey</persName> understands and agrees that
                        the negotiations should continue. He is worried that progress might be made
                        which could be used against the President. I pointed out to him that no
                        progress had been made in the negotiations since last September and that it
                        was unlikely that any significant progress could be made until the
                        negotiators came back to the President for further instructions since the
                        duration issue was at the heart of the remaining issues and there is no room
                        for agreement under present instructions.</p>
                    <p>There does not seem to be much substantive disagreement between the two
                        sides, but working relations are at present bad, and there is a possibility
                        that further misunderstanding could arise.</p>
                    <p>Bud<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">Robert “Bud” McFarlane of the National
                            Security Council Staff.</note> has asked that I let you know what events
                        are presently scheduled by the negotiators. <hi rend="italic">As of this
                            morning, they had planned to go down to Panama about July 10 for a week
                            to ten days.</hi> During the meeting all of the issues would be
                        discussed on an exploratory basis. The attempt <pb n="324" facs="0349"
                            xml:id="pg_324"/>would be to clarify the issues, narrow the differences,
                        and define positions. There was <hi rend="italic">no thought of any
                            agreement coming out of the meeting.</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">Then the negotiators had in mind skipping a month and
                            going back in September.</hi> In this country <hi rend="italic">there is
                            no testimony planned in Congress or any speeches scheduled.</hi> The
                        negotiators are responding on a background basis in answer to questions. The
                        testimony given recently before the Panama Canal Subcommittee has been
                        corrected and is being returned to the Congress. It is understood that <hi

                                >Snyder</persName> will probably reintroduce his amendment to

                            negotiations.</hi><note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">See <ref target="#d85fn2"
                                >footnote 2, Document 85</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>I continue to believe that to suspend negotiations now would be defensive and
                        in effect would admit the correctness of the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName> position. When I said that I understood our
                        guidelines to be “<hi rend="italic">deliberate and careful
                        negotiations</hi>”, I <hi rend="italic">meant that we should continue
                            discussions with the Panamanians issue by issue, attempting to move the
                            negotiations along so that by the time we get to 1977 we will have a
                            feel for the shape of a possible treaty.</hi> By “deliberate and
                        careful”, I meant that I saw no reason for our making any new concessions at
                        this point but that we should continue discussing the issues with the
                        Panamanians. The phrase also describes the pace which would be unhurried,
                        but continue. We would neither aim at early agreement nor would we suspend
                        all progress.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_VVV_1">Veysey</persName> had said that he would not
                        want to suspend the negotiations. I gather that he and Hoffman really do
                        want to do so and have now convinced <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"
                            >Clements</persName> of this.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, I think <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> will
                        probably go to <persName corresp="#p_BPW_1">Buchen</persName>

                        therefore, has now become whether or not to continue the negotiations. My
                        own recommendation remains what it was in my May 13 memo.<note n="5"

                    <p>a. The United States Panama Canal Negotiations Team was in Panama from
                        Saturday, 1 May, to Friday, 7 May. The primary purpose of this negotiating
                        round was to get acquainted with the new Panamanian Foreign Minister and
                        Chief Negotiator, <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Aquilino Boyd</persName>,
                        and to review with him the progress in the negotiations to date. There were,
                        in all, three meetings of the two full teams and one technical-level meeting
                        on the issue of lands and waters.</p>
                    <p>b. At the first meeting the United States Team presented their view of the
                        progress in the negotiations to date, emphasizing the movement over time
                        (since 1967) in the United States’ positions. At the second team meeting the
                        Panamanian Team presented their view of the progress in the negotiations,
                        including a statement of their formal negotiating positions on the
                        issues.</p>
                    <p>c. The third team meeting was devoted to a discussion of the differences in
                        the Teams’ respective views of progress, particularly in the issues of
                        duration, expansion, the level of US Forces, and the nature of the new
                        administrative entity. The results of the discussion on the issues are
                        summarized below:</p>
                    <pb n="327" facs="0352" xml:id="pg_327"/>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Duration.</hi> The Panamanian position on this issue
                        now is a termination date for both defense and operation of the year 2000
                        but a transfer in majority voting control to Panama in 1995. The Panamanian
                        team stressed the impossibility of their going beyond the year 2000 and
                        suggested that the US begin to formulate its positions on other issues with
                        this shorter duration in mind. They wanted, in essence, a list of what
                        Panamanian concessions would be required in order for the United States to
                        accept 2000 as the Treaty’s termination date. The United States team
                        responded by pointing to its movement over time on this issue, to the
                        February discussions on possible avenues of accommodation, and to Panama’s
                        backward movement, and by suggesting that it was for Panama to propose a
                        solution on this issue.</p>
                    <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Force Level.</hi> The Panamanian position on this issue
                        now is that at the inception of the Treaty, the level of US Forces shall not
                        exceed the level of Guardia Nacional Forces and that there shall be a
                        process of reducing this level over time—a process linked to dates. The
                        Panamanians stated that the level would not apply in times of
                        “conflagration”—that the US Forces could be reinforced unilaterally in these
                        cases. When pressed on what they meant by that term, they suggested that the
                        US would have the unilateral right to reinforce not only in cases of
                        conflict with third countries but also in cases of threats to the Canal from
                        non-governmental sources within Panama. The US negotiators noted the
                        Panamanian comments.</p>
                    <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Nature of the New Canal Administrative Entity.</hi> On
                        this issue the US team stressed its position that the new entity must be a
                        US Government agency, arguing that it is not only a political necessity but
                        also consistent with the Statement of Principles. The Panamanians are
                        continuing to ask that the Canal be administered by an international
                        juridical entity created by the Treaty, with the US exercising effective
                        control through a majority of votes on the Board of Directors.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Chief Negotiators Session.</hi> A separate meeting of
                        the Chief Negotiators, Minister Boyd and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>, was held during the evening of 6
                        May. Also in attendance were LTG <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"

                            Escobar</persName> Bethancourt.</p>
                    <p>At this meeting <hi rend="italic">Foreign Minister Boyd</hi> said that the
                        Panamanian Team has a “message” to deliver to the United States negotiators.
                        It was to the effect that Panama is “firm” on a duration period for both
                        Canal operation and Canal defense which terminates in the year 2000.
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> stated that he
                        understood the “message” but reiterated that it was nearly impossible to
                        conceive of a set of concessions which Panama could, as a practical matter,
                        make that could lead the United States toward agreement on the year
                        2000.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Technical Meeting—Land and Waters.</hi> On 6 May,

                        Panamanian represent<pb n="328" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_328"/>atives, met to
                        review the land and waters issue at the technical level. No maps or
                        documents were exchanged or utilized in the discussions. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> emphasized that the US
                        representatives were working hard to develop a position which would address
                        the Panamanian areas of “high impact”. He indicated that this approach in
                        turn would require the Panamanians to agree to US retention of certain areas
                        we deem important. General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName>
                        also indicated that our approach which substituted specific treaty land and
                        water “use rights” for large areas under Entity control was controversial.
                            <persName corresp="#p_FVE_1">Edwin Fabrega</persName> stated that there
                        was also great controversy within the Panamanian Government regarding the
                        issue of land and waters. Various other aspects of the issue were discussed
                        in general terms.</p>

                            >PCG</gloss> representatives during the period 28 April–3 May 1976. The
                        land and waters position will be incorporated into the US presentation at
                        the next negotiating round. The position still has no official status;
                        consequently, it will be presented on an unofficial basis. Since the
                        proposal has been subjected to numerous discussions with both US and
                        Panamanian representatives, it is believed that the areas of disagreement
                        have been narrowed to the point where the interests of both sides may be
                        accommodated.</p>
                    <p>b. General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> and General
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAEV_1">McAuliffe</persName> met for 2½ hours on
                        30 April to discuss the land and waters issue. As a result of their
                        discussions, it appears that most of the defense related aspects of the land
                        and water issue have been accommodated, provided the “unilateral US defense
                        requirement” is resolved.</p>

                        to discuss the land and water issue as it applies to the Entity. The
                        Governor did not modify his position regarding the issue. He did, however,
                        agree to review and comment on General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"
                            >Dolvin</persName>’s land and waters position. Detailed comments were
                        developed during the period 30 April–3 May 1976. These comments will be
                        provided to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Upon

                    <p>a. The next negotiating session will take place in early July after the
                        conclusion of the primaries. At that time the United States negotiators plan
                        to present a comprehensive position on all the major issues, i.e., duration,
                        nature of the entity, neutrality, land and waters, employee rights and
                        benefits, and expansion. The position will be unofficial and be presented on
                        a “what if” basis. It is anticipated that the Panamanians will respond in
                        kind.</p>
                    <p>b. In order to prepare the US position, Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> has directed the Deputy Negotiators
                        to provide him with a coordinated position not later than 15 June 1976. The
                            <gloss target="#t_PCNWG_1">PCNWG</gloss> will meet shortly to coordinate
                        this effort.</p>

                    <p>1. The following information was obtained from [<hi rend="italic">2½ lines
                            not declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Aquilino Boyd Guardia</persName>, Foreign
                        Minister and chief canal treaty negotiator, said on 22 May 1976 that General
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Omar Torrijos Herrera</persName>, Chief of
                        Government, recently had instructed the negotiators to be prepared to offer
                        new concessions on defense, lands and waters, and other less important
                        issues in order to obtain the agreement of the United States that the
                        duration of the new canal treaty not extend beyond this century. According
                        to Boyd, <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> recently came to
                        the conclusion that the widespread international support which Panama has
                        received on the treaty negotiations will insure that Panama’s goal of taking
                        over the canal in this century will be achieved. This will be a great
                        triumph for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and for
                        Panama. Boyd said that duration is clearly the most important issue to
                        Panama, and that if it can be resolved successfully, the other issues can be
                        resolved in a brief period of time.</p>
                    <p>3. Boyd said he believes one manner of possibly satisfying the desire of the
                        United States to retain residual defense rights beyond the year 2000 would
                        be for the United States and Panama to agree to a cooperation and mutual
                        assistance pact similar to that which existed between the Soviet Union and
                        Egypt from May 1971 until March 1976. Such a pact would be totally separate
                        from the new canal treaty, but would stipulate that the United States could
                        come to the assistance of Panama to defend the canal at any time of
                        emergency or danger which affected the security of the canal. This pact
                        could be written to extend beyond the life of the new canal treaty, thus
                        satisfying United States aspirations on canal defense, while at the same
                        time avoiding the problems which Panama would face if the new canal treaty
                        included provision for a United States presence in Panama which extended
                        into <pb n="331" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_331"/>the next century. In addition,
                        the pact would guarantee that all United States ships would have
                        unrestricted transit through the canal.</p>
                    <p>4. Boyd said he had presented his idea of a separate mutual assistance pact
                        to <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, who agreed that it
                        appeared to be a good idea. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> told Boyd to prepare a draft proposal of such a
                        pact for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ consideration.
                        Boyd said that if his proposal was approved by <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> it would be presented to the United States during
                        the next round of treaty talks.</p>
                    <p>5. Boyd commented that during a seminar for government employees which was
                        held recently, he was asked how much longer Panama would continue to
                        negotiate a new canal treaty before it decided to resort to violence to
                        obtain the canal. Boyd said that he responded that Panama intended to keep
                        negotiating in a rational manner until a new treaty was agreed upon and that
                        violence would be avoided at all costs. He said Panama’s cause would be lost
                        if violence were employed. Boyd said he told the questioner he had learned
                        that the people of the United States were very emotional and they rallied
                        together strongly when they were attacked. He recalled the forceful appeal
                        which the phrases “Remember the Alamo” and “Remember Pearl Harbor” had had
                        in past years, and he said that he did not want to allow a situation to
                        develop where the new rallying cry would be “Remember Panama”.</p>

                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> in Cocaine Traffic.</p>
                    <p>1. Bogota DEA Office (BDO) has just informed me that they have unconfirmed
                        information from one of their confidential informants (CI’s) of a cocaine
                        deal with Panama which involves General Omar <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> himself, and that CI has been invited to “invest”
                        in the proposed deal and visit Panama later this month to take part in
                        negotiations possibly to include (allegedly) contacts with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. BDO’s question is whether to
                        instruct CI to enter scheme and go to Panama or not. Because of obvious
                        extreme sensitivity and possible ramifications I am submitting matter for
                        Department’s information, guidance and instructions.</p>
                    <p>2. BDO’s information is as follows: CI SZE–6–0012 states that a Colombian
                        group, principals of which are a Hernan Garcia Mora, a not well-known flour
                        mill owner and businessman, Alejandro Lozano Aparicio, Colombian national
                        (otherwise unidentified) and a Colombian Air Force Captain Russi, invited
                        him to travel to Panama with them between June 15 and June 20 to meet with
                        General Omar <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and his
                        brother. Allegedly, Garcia Mora will be discussing a legitimate coffee and
                        sugar transaction, but under cover of this, group will also discuss a future
                        cocaine delivery. Lozano, who is a long time friend of CI, offered this
                        “business opportunity” to CI. According to CI, he was told group will be met
                        at Panama airport by General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>. Garcia Mora will be carrying a letter from
                        President Lopez introducing this group and their coffee and sugar trade
                        proposals. This letter and the trade “mission” are legitimate and will be
                        used by the group as the cover. CI further stated that an unknown man
                        involved in Panama’s casinos will be the contact man when the cocaine is
                        delivered. This person is said to be an “extremely close friend” of
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. Bogota CI is in a
                        position to either accept the offer and travel with the group to Panama or
                        to decline.</p>
                    <p>3. BDO informs me that CI has been used by them for about a month; he is an
                        emerald dealer, allegedly never involved himself in narcotics, but who
                        “knows” the criminal network. He was recruited to provide intelligence
                        information. Information provided so far looks good, but its reliability has
                        not really been tested. BDO states CI “fell into” above <pb n="333"
                            facs="0358" xml:id="pg_333"/>information; it was not part of
                        intelligence BDO has been seeking develop with CI. BDO further tells me that
                        as far as can be ascertained Garcia Mora and company have never been in
                        narcotics before. BDO speculates that what happened is that someone in
                        Panama, aware of a legitimate business venture and trip, contacted Lozano
                        and suggested use of it as cover for cocaine deal, and Lozano contacted CI
                        because they probably need him for connections with cocaine traffickers. BDO
                        has confirmed that two Colombian Air Force flights are scheduled between
                        June 15 and 20, one of which will be carrying Commander of Colombian Air
                        Force on a legitimate visit to Panama and who might very likely be met at
                        airport by General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>.
                        Whether there is any connection between this and CI version, whether
                        businessmen and Air Force Captain involved would be on that plane or not, is
                        all speculation at this point.</p>
                    <p>4. BDO states it does not know how good CI’s information is as to General
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ involvement, and that
                        conceivably General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ name
                        is simply being invoked by others (possibly family) trying to set up deal. I
                        personally am very skeptical that General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> himself is involved or would himself “negotiate”.
                        Nor do I discount possibility story brought to us as provocation.
                        Nevertheless since we have received that information and CI is in effect
                        asking whether he should go (on our behalf), there is an issue. There are
                        obviously three options: a) simply drop matter; b) send the CI; or c) do not
                        send CI, but have him simply keep contact and see if he gets any other
                        information. (In this case if group hoped to use CI to get cocaine, CI would
                        have to “introduce” them to other potential connections and step aside).</p>
                    <p>5. Basic issue of course is whether USG through DEA agents should set up an
                        operation designed to confirm, probe, expose or entrap (depending on how one
                        looks at it) a foreign Chief of State, and the information this would put
                        into the hands of a Colombian informant regarding DEA agents’ interest in,
                        and presumably efforts to probe, General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>’ possible involvement.<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2"
                            >No evidence of an operation to investigate <persName

                            been found.</note></p>
                    <p>6. BDO would appreciate guidance and instructions. To restrict dissemination,
                        above information has not been passed in normal channel to HQS DEA, Caracas
                        Regional Office or Panama DEA. Department will wish to make appropriate

                        cannot make lateral distribution in this channel, Dept. may also wish inform

                        republics has really changed. At Tlatelolco, the whole thing was an attack
                        on the United States. The atmosphere has improved greatly.<note n="2"

                        cooperated very well. We should move carefully. We are getting most of the

                        disappointed with the press reports of the President’s statement about
                        giving us the Canal at the end of its useful life.<note n="3"

                            “All the experts that I have talked to tell me that the economic

                            getting less and less valuable as a means of transportation today than
                            it was 5 or 10 years ago. So, what we are trying to do is to make sure
                            that during the economic lifetime of the canal, we have an absolute
                            control over it.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                        my own mistake about defense. But considering it was Florida,<note n="4"

                            is possible to achieve arrangements in which our interests in the
                            defense of the canal and in the operation of the canal are fully
                            safeguarded but in which, at the same time, we are avoiding the
                            possibilities that are inherent in that situation, where all of the
                            Latin American countries could unite against the United States on that
                            narrow issue. I repeat: the United States will not surrender its
                            interests in the defense of the canal or its interests in the operation

                    <p>I do think that at the next meeting we have to make some progress in terms of
                        the duration issue. We have talked about the end of the century. <persName

                    <p>Secretary: On operation, there is no problem.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: We are willing to look for all
                        kinds of safeguards regarding neutrality and the openness of the Canal. Who
                        is going to be more happy than the present generation of Panamanians in
                        1995? They will be in a very good position.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: If we had a clause in which you guaranteed free access in
                        perpetuity, that might do it. Then it would take a lot of courage if you
                        were to violate it. You couldn’t get away with it. I believe it is a problem
                        that we can find a solution for by handling practical problems through
                        practical provisions. You have to remember that for us to continue the
                        formal consideration process during a campaign is some thing. We have no
                        discipline now. People don’t care if they’re fired. <pb n="336" facs="0361"
                            xml:id="pg_336"/>If the Democrats win, they will pursue our policy. If
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> wins, you know what we
                        would do. The thing is to get through the next few months without it
                        becoming an issue. Can’t they work on practical issues like access and a few
                        things that safeguard our rights other than duration?</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: Since this is a package of
                        eight points, you have to tell your team and we will work it out. Tell them
                        to present a term of duration relating it to the other points. They can say,
                        we are willing to do this and that and the other things.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: It’s okay if we don’t do it in July. You understand we can’t do
                        anything without it becoming public. We want to put it up to Congress with
                        an elected president. If we did it now, even a Democratic candidate might be
                        forced to say things he didn’t want to say. I want to keep Panama out of the
                        campaign. Our joint declaration was very helpful.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: I have another idea. Have
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> come up with a
                        proposal on duration from the military side.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: No, it wouldn’t work. I know the Pentagon. We have made great
                        progress. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> has come around
                        to our point of view. Now he is on our side and we have <persName
                            corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>. Even in Phoenix I really
                        supported negotiations. All I said was that if we failed we would defend the
                        Canal, but I don’t expect that we will fail. I will talk to the General but
                        don’t expect major progress in July.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: You have to think about our
                        internal situation. General <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> is not having an easy time.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: It is amazing. He has done a superhuman job. You and he have shown
                        great wisdom under trying conditions.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>d: We are afraid we might be
                        thrown to the lions if we don’t do something by August. The economic
                        situation is not very good.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: The Republican Convention is on August 16. Until then <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> will attack the President on
                        anything.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: Then can’t you do something
                        through an executive order in Panama to alleviate the situation? We want to
                        build a container port. Our Minister of Finance wants to see Bill Rogers
                        about this.</p>
                    <p>Rogers: I would be delighted to see him if he wants to come.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: We will extend ourselves for that. Is there anything the military
                        can do in Panama?</p>
                    <p>Rogers: The problem of a container port is that it is not just an Executive
                        Branch decision, and Congress feels very strongly about disposing of
                        property.</p>

                    <p>Secretary: I have high regard for him and appreciate his restraint. The Vice
                        President knows him personally and has a very high regard. <pb n="337"
                            facs="0362" xml:id="pg_337"/>The President has stuck by the
                        negotiations. We all know what the issues are. We can try to work them out
                        with some kind of guaranteed access in perpetuity, do something on lands and
                        waters now. That is one area where we ought to be able to be more
                        flexible.</p>
                    <p>Lopez: We have talked and talked and talked about this.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: If we can’t do anything on duration, we can move on lands and
                        waters.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: After drawing up the draft of
                        an agreement, we will have to do something which will give a forceful
                        optical impression like the disappearance of the Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: It will be a historical event and I think we ought to make
                        something out of it.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Boyd</persName>: I am convinced that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> will continue to help.
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and Rockefeller are
                        two persons who have tried to show good will.</p>
                    <p>Secretary: I have been very impressed by your conduct here. It has been calm
                        and constructive.</p>

                    <p>The Negotiators met with Ambassador Gonzalez-Revilla and <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ confidant Rodrigo Gonzalez June
                        24. The Panamanians reiterated that the Boyd-<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> conversation at Santiago<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d127fn2">See <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref>.</note> had
                        a “heavy” adverse impact on their Government.</p>
                    <p>Panama interpreted the Secretary’s remarks as (a) indicating that the
                        President is not prepared to fulfill his negotiating commitments <pb n="338"
                            facs="0363" xml:id="pg_338"/>before November—or, indeed, perhaps before
                        the year’s end, and (b) ruling out any “substantial progress” at all during
                        this period (progress, that is, on the duration-neutrality complex).</p>
                    <p>More important, Panama has concluded that the United States deceived Panama
                        at Santiago. It lured Panama into the Joint Report and the Resolution,<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">Regarding the joint report, see <ref

                            219 (VI–0/76) on the status of the negotiations, adopted on June 17,
                            recognized the “significant differences” between the parties but
                            expressed the hope that the negotiations would be completed in
                            1976.</note> which told of significant progress, then after those
                        documents were on the record the Secretary told Boyd: “no more progress this
                        year”. They confided that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        came close to instructing <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> Ambassador
                        Pitty to “lash out” at the United States publicly following the

                    <p>Responding, the Negotiators pointed out that the <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1"

                        arrangement with <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> included
                        an understanding that there could not be much progress before the year’s
                            end.<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">See <ref target="#d97">Document

                            1976. “<persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> replied that
                            one or two years would not be ‘a problem.’” (Telegram 215649 to Panama
                            City, September 10, 1975; National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"
                                >RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D750314–0185)</note>
                        Rodrigo Gonzalez confirmed that <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> had, indeed, so understood. But, he explained,
                        domestic problems for <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> had
                        increased in the period since that arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The Panamanians asked what the two negotiating teams should do “between now
                        and then”, and the wisdom of holding a round in July was addressed.</p>
                    <p>The Negotiators pointed out that if a round were to be held before the
                        Republican Convention, the U.S. positions could not be very attractive to
                        Panama, and that a July round could conceivably add to the President’s
                        troubles in the election campaign. But they wished to know if Panama had any
                        desire for a July round, on the understanding that not much substantive
                        negotiating would probably be possible. The Panamanians said they would
                        consult on this question.</p>
                    <p>Late in the evening of June 24, Gonzalez-Revilla telephoned me to say that
                        the United States could be “99% certain” that Panama agreed to putting the
                        next round over until after the August Convention. I told him that we wanted
                        to be sure that such a course would be 100% agreeable to Panama—that we did
                        not want Panama to feel that the United States was imposing a postponement,
                        and that the United States would be willing to hold a July round without
                        much substantive progress should Panama so desire.</p>
                    <pb n="339" facs="0364" xml:id="pg_339"/>
                    <p>Gonzalez-Revilla said he understood our position fully, and would let us know
                        once he returned to Panama if there were any change in the Panamanian
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Several remarks he made in the course of the conversation led me to infer
                        that we should not expect all sweetness and light from Panama during this
                        waiting period. <note n="5" xml:id="d127fn5">In a June 23 memorandum to

                            Panama was ready to “(a) declare publicly that an impasse in the

                        believe that Panama would have considerable difficulty with your proposal as
                        formulated. In any event I shall study it most carefully and will consider
                        how it might be presented. I do not intend to proceed except in full
                        consultation with you.</p>
                    <p>Another matter of considerable concern not only here but in Panama as well is
                        the pace and timing of negotiations. I share your view that we must be
                        sensitive to our domestic environment and move forward with due caution. At
                        the same time our own interests would not be served if the negotiations were
                        allowed to idle for too long a time. We must take account of the Panamanian
                        dimension, particularly their internal pressures and the expectations which
                        derive in part from your conversation with General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> last fall. As I recall,
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> accepted your judgment
                        that it would not be possible to complete the treaty before the end of this
                        year. Clearly, however, Panama has its political needs. In this context,
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> has indicated—both
                        privately and publicly—that tangible negotiating progress is necessary by
                        early next year or he will find it difficult to cope with internal
                        pressures.</p>
                    <p>As you know, important differences remain on many of the major issues in the
                        negotiation. Much work will be required if we are to develop negotiable
                        positions, in compliance with the Joint Statement of Principles, that may
                        permit us to reach an overall conceptual agreement by early next year. In
                        this regard I believe that we should aim for an initialled conceptual accord
                        by January 9, 1977, which will be the 13th anniversary of the 1964 riots.
                        Even after the conceptual accord has been initialled we must still engage in
                        the laborious and time-consuming task of drafting treaty language.</p>
                    <p>Based on my discussions with Tom <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"
                            >Dolvin</persName> and other members of the negotiating team, I propose
                        the following scenario:</p>
                    <p>During September we would hold a low-key or private round to discuss major
                        outstanding issues on an informal, and wholly tentative basis. Our team
                        would discuss the range of alternatives regarding some or all of the issues
                        but no formal positions would be tabled. The following month we would expect
                        Panama to respond to the ideas covered in the preceding month and we would
                        then want to study the Panamanian positions with you. Then, after the
                        election, both negotiating teams would meet in Panama and/or Washington to
                        try and reach formal but <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi> agreement on
                        the major issues. If necessary, we would return in coordination with Defense
                        to the President for additional guidance so that we might reach overall
                        conceptual agreement on the major treaty issues by no later than January 9,
                        1977.</p>
                    <p>This schedule, of course, would be tentative and subject to revision in the
                        light of developments later in the year. Nevertheless, in my <pb n="341"
                            facs="0366" xml:id="pg_341"/>judgment it represents an honest effort to
                        achieve the minimum to be accomplished and still sustain credible
                        negotiating momentum.</p>
                    <p>Assuming you agree with this general scenario, I would appreciate your
                        cooperation in conveying this decision to the appropriate officials in
                        Defense. Meanwhile, I would welcome your views.</p>
                    <p>With warm regards,</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        officials, of whom he was one, considered it most urgent, in the interests
                        of both sides, that the United States follow this course.</p>
                    <p>He then spoke of the prevailing general atmosphere in Panama, and of his view
                        of the current government, in terms similar to those which he had used
                        shortly before in conversation with Mr. May (Memcon of July 15)<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d129fn3">Not found.</note> but even less qualified and more
                        pessimistic in tone. This government was confronting a host of internal
                        problems which could threaten its very existence but with which it was
                        totally unable to cope. <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        had virtually ceased making decisions essential to the country, and no one
                        else seemed capable of doing so. Substantial sectors were aware of the
                        government’s growing incapacity and were increasingly alienated from it; the
                        government itself was aware of this but seemed powerless to arrest or
                        reverse this decline in confidence in its capability to command the support
                        of the population, or to govern effectively.</p>
                    <p>There was, <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> said, a similar
                        public perception of drift regarding the treaty negotiations which had
                            <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>, and the “political
                        group” which advised him, in a box. All concerned on the Panamanian side
                        appreciated that it was unrealistic to expect substantial progress at the
                        political level on the remaining issues before the U.S. election. However,
                        there was also a general appreciation that the growing uncertainty in this
                        country about the negotiations, and about the government in general, might
                        therefore result in the government’s running out of time. In this
                        atmosphere, actions by <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and
                        the “political group” could become unpredictable.</p>

                        stressed, that there were forces within Panama essentially hostile to the
                        sort of treaty which the U.S. negotiators and at least some of their
                        Panamanian counterparts were seeking to reach, and that at this time these
                        forces were preponderant within the government and in their advice to

                    <p>COMMENT: <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> has frequently
                        stated to Embassy officers his personal belief that <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> and some of those around him do
                        not really want a new treaty because the treaty would initiate fundamental
                        changes in the society which <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> could no longer control. The reporting officer does
                        not accept this view; but in the context of this conversation, this appears
                        to be a distinction without essential significance. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName>’ real point was that the group
                        for whom he represented himself as speaking, identified below, was
                        outclassed by a group with divergent and, in his view, less responsible
                        ideas. END COMMENT.</p>
                    <p>The Panamanian members of the lands and waters technical sub-group, and other
                        officials involved in the technical aspects of the treaty negotiations, had
                        consistently advised their American counterparts of their sincere desire
                        that technical discussions and progress at this level continue regardless of
                        what might transpire at the political level of the negotiations. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> stated that, after various
                        recent conversations with other officials of similar persuasion, he wished
                        to reiterate their conviction that it was absolutely necessary that
                        discussion of the lands and waters issue at the technical level continue
                        uninterrupted regardless of whatever pauses, coolings or other developments
                        (at one point, he used the word “rupture”) took place at the political
                        level, or even in overall political relations between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>It was for this reason that he and those of similar persuasion felt so
                        strongly that the United States should respond positively to their
                        suggestion that further technical discussions continue in Washington. At
                        such time as this group had exhausted its ground on the lands and waters
                        issue, he suggested that it might continue to be active by transforming
                        itself into a renewed sub-group (analogous to the one which was briefly
                        active in April 1975) on administration and on transitional steps for
                        Panamanian participation in the operation of the Canal.<note n="4"

                        for technical-level discussions was the vexed question of employees, and
                        still another was the future status of agencies other than PanCanal or the

                    <p>COMMENT: This is the first time recently that <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1"
                            >Velasquez</persName> has been so bluntly pessimistic about the current
                        state of the Panamanian government and its policy toward the negotiations in
                        the presence of another Panamanian official. After completing his
                        exposition, <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> referred to
                        the fact that <persName corresp="#p_JO_1">Jaen</persName> had said very
                        little during the conversation and characterized him with a slight smile as
                        “un hombre muy prudente”—“maybe more prudent that I am”. Nevertheless,
                            <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> said, <persName
                            corresp="#p_JO_1">Jaen</persName> shared the opinions he had voiced, and
                        he had spoken on <persName corresp="#p_JO_1">Jaen</persName>’s behalf as
                        well. <persName corresp="#p_JO_1">Jaen</persName> indicated assent.</p>
                    <p>It is not at all clear to the reporting officer whether <persName
                            corresp="#p_VFA_1">Velasquez</persName> was trying to indicate that he
                        knew that something adverse to the negotiations <hi rend="italic">would</hi>
                        take place, or that he was simply apprehensive that something, in the
                        current atmosphere, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> take place. In either
                        event, the reporting officer interprets him as indicating by this
                        conversation that he and those others whom he named—a group which includes
                        most of the ‘moderates’ with access to <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> on the treaty issue—could do little to influence
                        any such developments at this time. <persName corresp="#p_VFA_1"
                            >Velasquez</persName>’ insistence on this group’s perception of need for
                        “technical” discussions during a period in which there may be “political”
                        developments which they may not like would provide at least an appearance of
                        continued movement toward the treaty they want. In addition, however, it
                        smacks of trying to create for themselves a psychological bomb shelter
                        against an adverse contingency which they apparently perceive as possible
                        but also see themselves as unable otherwise to prevent. END COMMENT.</p>

                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> explained that the
                        Panama Canal negotiations were now somewhat in the doldrums and would
                        probably remain so at least until after the Republican Convention and
                        perhaps until after the November elections. He explained that Panama has
                        been very understanding to date particularly in view of the fact that
                        negotiations have been underway for over 12 years now. He said Foreign
                        Minister Boyd as Chief Negotiator has brought a high level of
                        professionalism to the Panamanian side in the talks and has been most
                        understanding of our domestic problems. He noted that Boyd tended to be
                        somewhat less moody than his predecessor, Juan Antonio <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJA_1">Tack</persName>, which made him somewhat easier to
                        deal with. He noted that the Secretary had contacted Boyd counselling
                        Panamanian moderation both at the Non-Aligned Conference in Colombo and in
                        the United Nations. Although Boyd responded well to the Secretary’s remarks,
                        the Ambassador said that it was sometimes difficult to restrain <persName

                            the Panamanian negotiator that “we want to avoid the kind of
                            international discussion of this issue during the coming months which
                            could rekindle domestic controversy here and obstruct U.S.-Panamanian

                        possible that some difficulty may arise during the Non-Aligned

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAEV_1">McAuliffe</persName> noted that the
                        so-called non-aligned nations were not always so non-aligned, intimating
                        that their positions may well be <pb n="346" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_346"
                        />strongly biased against the West. General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1"
                            >Dolvin</persName> noted that the Non-Aligned Conference would take
                        place concurrently with the Republican Convention which may cause some
                        difficulty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAEV_1">McAuliffe</persName> said that
                        if trouble did arise it could very well further complicate the negotiations
                        which already were complicated enough. He said in his view the Panama Canal
                        treaty was one of the stickiest negotiations he had ever encountered.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> agreed saying that
                        he personally had never been involved in a negotiation that had lasted this
                        long or had been this complex. He noted that many of the toughest issues are
                        still in front of us, such as those on duration and neutrality. He referred
                        to Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>’
                        position on neutrality saying that although it may be difficult to sell the
                        negotiators were willing to give it a try.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">See
                                <ref target="#d128fn2">footnote 2, Document 128</ref>.</note> He
                        said that at least it had the advantage of eliminating US bases and military
                        forces in Panama and to that extent may be attractive to the Panamanians. He
                        noted that the issue would not be raised until after the elections although
                        the negotiators did intend to return to Panama in September to discuss other
                        issues. He remarked that it was our objective to attempt to get conceptual
                        agreement by next January, which would be the 13th anniversary of the 1964
                        riots in Panama, although he noted that the drafting of treaty language
                        would take a considerable period of time even after conceptual agreement had
                        been reached.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_MAEV_1">McAuliffe</persName> said that he was struck
                        upon taking over his new job in <gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss> by the
                        dramatic political changes which have taken place in the Caribbean area over
                        the past decade. He said he was amazed by the dynamics of the area and by
                        economic as well as political developments. He noted that the presence of
                        Cuba had complicated the picture considerably. In that regard he said that
                        the political situation in Jamaica was very bad and that there were now
                        indications that the Cubans were also becoming involved in the tiny island
                        of Dominica. He said from the standpoint of <gloss target="#t_ISA_1"
                            >ISA</gloss> it was most difficult to foresee developments there and to
                        plan to commit sufficient military resources to be able to cope with any
                        contingencies which might arise. He said that it was a fact that previous
                        administrations had pretty well neglected the area and that it was obvious
                        that the United States does not have very clear ideas as to how to proceed
                        there. He said that with regard to the Panama Canal negotiations he would be
                        glad to be of help in any way possible.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> said that he was
                        looking forward to working with <gloss target="#t_ISA_1">ISA</gloss> as the
                        negotiations moved forward. He noted that he did not <pb n="347" facs="0372"
                            xml:id="pg_347"/>want to unduly bother Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAEV_1"
                            >McAuliffe</persName> with unnecessary details on the talks but did want
                        to make sure that he was kept fully informed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MAEV_1">McAuliffe</persName> concluded by saying
                        that in his view the negotiations were in excellent hands and that he had no
                        complaints as to how things were proceeding. He only noted that the talks
                        should be pursued at a “proper pace.”</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are a list of attendees and discussion of unrelated
                        matters.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schlaudeman: Mr. Secretary, we will need a decision on whether <persName
                            corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> should come back to Panama next
                        month.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, his
                        schedule is insane. It is impossible. There is no possible way that we can
                        lock this thing up between November and January, without looking like having
                        perpetrated a fraud on the American people. You can’t have an election and
                        then before the inauguration come in with a Panama Treaty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schlaudeman: But I think the question here is whether his going wouldn’t
                        be a good step in keeping <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        more or less quiet.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no
                        problem with the going, as long as he doesn’t do anything.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schlaudeman: O.K.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But he had
                        better disabuse them of that schedule idea that he has—it is absolutely
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>We will start negotiating in good faith after the election. But there has to
                        be a plausible process.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schlaudeman: Yes.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We haven’t made
                        our internal decisions yet. And there is no possible way—</p>
                    <p>I mean, supposing if the President loses—I don’t think he can then do it. If
                        the President wins, then he can proceed in November and <pb n="348"
                            facs="0373" xml:id="pg_348"/>December to take the internal decisions.
                        But then it will still take a few months to negotiate it.</p>
                    <p>But if he loses, he has to leave it for the next Administration. I don’t see
                        how he, as President, can take a decision of this magnitude. It wouldn’t be
                        proper.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Schlaudeman: The Panamanians wouldn’t strike any deal under those
                        circumstances anyway.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It would raise a
                        serious Constitutional question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hartman: If you are seeing <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George
                            Bush</persName> at 1:00, as they thought you might be, there is a note
                        from George [Aldrich] that you should read.</p>
                    <p>[The Secretary left for another appointment.]</p>

                    <p>As Your Excellency is well aware, the United States Government, far from
                        being “interested in provoking a general crisis” in Panama, has cooperated
                        and continues to cooperate with Your Excellency’s Government for the
                        economic and social development of the people of Panama and continues to
                        seek an equitable solution to the principal problem between our countries
                        through the negotiation of a new Panama Canal Treaty.</p>
                    <p>I am sure that Your Excellency’s Government by now will have learned the true
                        details of the employment, nationality and activities of the three persons
                        who were mentioned by name in Your Excellency’s Note of September 17.
                        Nevertheless, in view of the seriousness of the allegations in that Note, I
                        take this opportunity officially to give Your Excellency certain information
                        on those persons:</p>

                    <p>1. Hector L. Downs, 20 years of age, is a Panamanian national. He once lived
                        in the Canal Zone as the dependent step-son of a civilian employee of the
                        United States Government, but insofar as my Government has been able to
                        determine, he has for some months lived in Panama City. He has never been
                        employed by the United States Armed Forces in any capacity whatsoever.</p>

                    <p>2. Pvt. [<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>], whose military
                        identification number is [<hi rend="italic">number not declassified</hi>] is
                        a private in the United States Army. He is 18 years old, joined the United
                        States Army on February 13, 1976 and arrived at his duty station on June 24,
                        1976 where he is employed as a finance clerk in Company C, Headquarters
                        Command of the 193rd <pb n="350" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_350"/>Infantry
                        Brigade. He was not on duty at the time of his arrest and was in Panama City
                        against the advice of the U.S. military authorities.</p>
                    <p>3. Rogelio Antolin Garcia Garcia, 29 years of age, is employed at the
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRB_1">Howard</persName> Air Force Base Post
                        Exchange as a check-out clerk, and has been in that employ since June 1,
                        1973. Mr. Garcia was born in San Jose, Costa Rica, and is a naturalized
                        Panamanian citizen. Cedula Number PE–1–242. He is not and never has been a
                        member of the Canal Zone police, as stated in Your Excellency’s Note.</p>
                    <p>As Your Excellency may ascertain from the above, only one of the persons
                        named in Your Excellency’s Note was a member of the Armed Forces of the
                        United States and a United States citizen. One other was a Panamanian
                        citizen employee of the United States Government. None was in any way
                        associated with any intelligence agency of the United States Government.
                        None was authorized by the United States Government to participate in any
                        disturbances.</p>
                    <p>I trust that Your Excellency will recognize that this does not constitute an
                        intrusion into the affairs of Your Excellency’s country by the Armed Forces
                        of the United States. I am happy to note that Vice President Gonzalez stated
                        in a message carried on Panamanian radio Saturday, September 18, that the
                        Government of Panama was not saying that any agency or any government was
                        involved in the recent disturbances, because it has no proof.</p>
                    <p>I have already discussed orally with Your Excellency the incidents concerning
                        the Southern Command News (SCN) radio mentioned in the note under reference
                        and explained them.<note n="5" xml:id="d132fn5">An “official report”

                        Excellency’s Government, from its careful monitoring of the SCN radio,
                        should be aware of the lengths to which military authorities in the Canal
                        Zone went in order to discourage persons under their authority from going to
                        troubled areas where they might become caught up in the disturbances.</p>
                    <p>I take this opportunity to protest in the name of my Government, those
                        portions of the official report issued by the Office of Information of the

                    <p>The appropriate authorities in the Canal Zone have been investigating the

                        citizens living in the Canal Zone. In view of the charges in the official
                        report and in the Note under reference, however, I would like to inform Your
                        Excellency that despite extensive investigation by Canal Zone authorities no
                        evidence has been uncovered which would indicate either that a conspiracy
                        was planned or that aid and comfort was given to provocateurs in the

                            wrong “to focus on things like radio broadcasts” and said “the most
                            important thing was to get the negotiations revived.” He hoped he would
                            have an opportunity in his forthcoming trip to the United States to talk

                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: We were eyeball to eyeball. <persName

                    <p>The Secretary: I explained to you in Santiago what is possible and what is

                        creating a situation which is difficult for him. If an agreement were
                        concluded in this atmosphere it would be impossible to ratify. I have
                        explained to you why it was not possible to proceed now when every opponent
                        is using the Panama issue against him. You saw it last night and you saw it
                        in the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> campaign . . . (coffee
                        arrives) . . . every time I sit down somebody descends upon me with
                        something to eat or drink. I have paid a heavy political price for my
                        commitment to these negotiations. To bring pressure this month is senseless.
                        We cannot achieve anything. We discussed this in Santiago in a constructive
                        spirit . . . You have behaved . . . To say Panama has been destabilized by
                        the United States is senseless. In Chile we did not try to destabilize and
                        indeed no one at the time said that we did. That has become part of the
                        political rhetoric after the fact. Allende was overthrown by elements with
                        which we had no contact. What we did try to do was to support parties which
                        would have run against him in 1976. So we are a bit sensitive about these
                        charges.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: On the other hand since May we have not sat at the
                        negotiating table. It would be constructive to go back to the table before
                        the election.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I agree, if you will allow me to talk for thirty seconds. The
                        more pressure you bring the less happily we return to the negotiating table.
                        The President has told me to tell you that we can begin negotiations again.
                        We cannot discuss duration before the election.</p>

                            >Torrijos</persName> last night. He issued a statement which he asked me

                    <p>The Secretary: Everyone here is upset too. I am in complete agreement with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: (Reading a quotation from <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> statement) We are concerned
                        about the light manner in which the candidates discussed Latin American
                        relations. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> said that
                        no American boys are losing their lives in war. But 20,000 American troops
                        are sleeping lightly in the Panama Canal Zone while Latin America awaits an
                        opportunity to exercise sovereignty there. Let me also remind Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that <hi rend="italic">never</hi>
                        was erased from the political lexicon after the liberation struggles. (End

                    <p>The Secretary: I believe that what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> said was totally irresponsible. It is mitigated only
                        by the fact that he has no intention of carrying it out. He went around the
                        world last night in what can only be described as a disgraceful performance.
                        It was political demagoguery in the worst sense. But fortunately we do not
                        conduct foreign policy by television debates.</p>

                        Governor Scranton).<note n="6" xml:id="d134fn6">During the debate, <persName

                        We will issue a statement on that today (laughter). I think one way not to
                        agree with Panama would be through confrontation. We have said repeatedly
                        that we want to settle this matter as an outstanding issue in our relations
                        with Panama and with Latin America.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: Let me speak in all frankness. You signed the
                        Statement of Principles and you have now watched the debate. It comes to our
                        mind that <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> might lose. You will
                        pack your bags and not tell anyone what you have had in mind for these
                        negotiations. The crucial issue will remain. When is the United States ready
                        to relinquish control of the Panama Canal Zone? As a man interested in
                        history and world peace and responsible for U.S. foreign relations you have
                        done a great job in completing the eight points. But when will you let us
                            <pb n="355" facs="0380" xml:id="pg_355"/>know what you have in mind for
                        duration? You will be returning to Harvard or writing for the <hi
                            rend="italic">New York Times.</hi> But we will still be here.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I will not be at Harvard. After running foreign relations of
                        the U.S. for eight years one is disqualified for teaching international
                        relations at Harvard (laughter). And I will not be writing for the <hi
                            rend="italic">New York Times.</hi></p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: We will be glad to have you in Panama.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: More seriously, I think <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName> will win. It is unfortunate that he had first an
                        irresponsible Republican challenger and now has an irresponsible Democratic
                        challenger. Whether we like it or not Panama is an issue which can get
                        Americans steamed up. This is a disadvantage for you.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: If we sit down now how long will the point of view of
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> prevail
                        particularly with respect to point two which calls for a treaty of fixed
                        duration? The Panamanian proposal for the year 2000 is reasonable.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: I will raise this with the President to see whether we can
                        give some indication of how he feels about this. But it would be a mistake
                        to throw duration into the campaign. Panama would gain nothing.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: I of course do not want to mix in U.S. internal
                        affairs. <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is saying that here
                        is a man who can be trusted. By the same token, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1"
                            >Ford</persName> is known to the Panamanian people.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We will be glad to send <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> down at the end of next week. I have confidence in
                        the ability of the two of you to avoid controversial issues even in an
                        election campaign when <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is
                        making this an issue. When do you want an answer?</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: Today would do a lot of good. We have scheduled a
                        demonstration October 11 right up against the Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Gonzalez-Revilla: There are two issues: resumption of the
                        negotiations and instructions on duration. Which one are you talking
                        about?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: What should the
                        announcement say about the talks?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: It should talk about the negotiations—about resuming the
                        negotiations, not what the negotiations are about. Each side is free to
                        raise what it wishes. We don’t have to say what the issues are now.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: Fair enough.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Gonzalez-Revilla: But . . .</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We should not say anything about this. We want you to know
                        that <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> will be able to go back
                        to Panama. All we want to say is that <persName corresp="#p_BE_1"
                            >Bunker</persName> will be going back to resume the negotiations.</p>
                    <pb n="356" facs="0381" xml:id="pg_356"/>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: There will be an open agenda. Each can present his
                        point of view.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: The President has authorized the trip. But we do not want to
                        be hit with an announcement which is negative. Let me call the White House.
                        (on the phone) Get me <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Scowcroft</persName>.
                        After I leave, I will only be fit to be a keeper of dangerous patients
                        (laughter). I have tried to bring about a new framework for our relations
                        with Panama. It is important for the White House. Panama has been a symbol
                        for the rest of the world. We do not want to make Panama a focal point for
                        our relations with everybody else.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: But how about your commitments?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: We generally carry out our international obligations. We have
                        always done what we said we would do.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton: The major problem is not the next three weeks and not in
                        signing an agreement. Rather it is with the ratification process. And
                        frankly Minister Boyd you could help by getting across to the leadership of
                        Panama—I know that your President understands but I mean the press—that our
                        problem does not revolve around the issues, even duration. What it really
                        revolves around is ratification.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: (on the phone, presumably with Hyland) We have told <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> to get back to Panama.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d134fn7">In telegram 251246 to Panama City, October 8, the

                        the plane to have heart attacks. (Secretary returns to conversation) The
                        real key is to say that we are resuming negotiations which go back to 1964.
                        We should not tie the resumption to any specific event. There was a recess
                        for the summer. We have always said that we would resume in October. I think
                        especially since the debate . . . Or do you think I should go out? It might
                        be very challenging for the press if I go out.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton: They (the Panamanians) know what to say.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Should I go out?</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton: No but they should use the correct words. You know that a
                        year ago if I had made a list of 50 foreign policy issues I would have put
                        the Panama Canal as number 49. Today I have put it first or second. We have
                        handled it well but the situation has not been easy.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: When was the last session?</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: May 4.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: How long did it last?</p>
                    <pb n="357" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_357"/>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: Four days. It was not a real round. Ambassador
                            <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> called it an evaluation, a
                        review of the issues.<note n="8" xml:id="d134fn8">See <ref target="#d123"
                                >Document 123</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Ambassador Gonzalez-Revilla: As far as the negotiation goes from what we saw
                        last night, Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> could
                        not reject everything.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: He could not fail to negotiate. He addressed the sovereignty
                        issue. I trust they would not seek confrontation with Panama when in office.
                        They will probably raise some hell now and get people upset. I want to keep
                        the negotiations on the track. But on reflection, rather than having you
                        announce this immediately after a meeting with me today, perhaps it would be
                        better to make the announcement tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: It would be difficult for us to keep quiet. It would
                        be practically impossible.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Okay, let us not make difficulties. Let us make it less of a
                        challenge for the press, less dramatic. We have been discussing resumption
                        for weeks. I will inform the press that we have decided today to resume the
                        negotiations after a summer recess and to send Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> back to Panama within the next two
                        weeks. There has been no new event which has occurred.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton: I know Minister Boyd well and trust and respect him. But
                        let us be practical. This is an important and an emotional issue for Panama.
                        If you don’t go, Henry, there will be questions which he can only answer in
                        his own interest.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Okay, each can say what he wants. I will say that there have
                        been exchanges in the last weeks. I told the Foreign Minister that the
                        President has decided to send <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>
                        down to resume negotiations within the next two weeks. We have agreed on
                        this mutually.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd: But you said at the end of next week.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: Within the next two weeks. It is better for us. And that
                        includes the end of next week. We can announce a precise date later after it
                        has been discussed and arranged in usual diplomatic channels.</p>
                    <p>Governor Scranton: This gives the announcement a vagueness which is better in
                        the United States. The second announcement of the precise date will have
                        impact in Panama but will hardly be noticed here.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary: This is the normal thing. It will be a bit imprecise. There
                        was a summer recess and we have now decided to renew the negotiations. If it
                        is dramatic it will be an invitation to the Democratic side and there will
                        be hell to pay. Each side will be free to raise issues it wants. On
                        duration, we cannot settle it now. We need to keep it in the right
                        framework. (At this point the meeting broke and the two <pb n="358"
                            facs="0383" xml:id="pg_358"/>principals went out to meet the press.
                        Since no press representatives were on hand, the Secretary told Boyd that he
                        (Boyd) could make the announcement alone, keeping in mind the framework
                        discussed during the meeting. The Secretary requested that Ambassador
                        Scranton remain behind for a brief discussion following the meeting with the
                        Minister.)</p>

                            corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> will be going down to where? Oh,

                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: He’s spent five days
                        so far. The fact that we’re resuming negotiations has been somewhat
                        obscured—at least, to the press. (Laughter.) Nobody’s paid much attention to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                            corresp="#p_ER_1">Ellsworth</persName> is to keep his mouth shut.</p>

                        Panamanians talk a good deal. They’ll have quite a bit to say.</p>

                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> is referring to his October
                            7 meeting with Boyd; see <ref target="#d134">Document
                        134</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: Which you said that
                        we would say publicly within two weeks but which you would get before the
                        end of it.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ll tell you,
                        I’ve got to cut down the number of people coming to my meetings. Come down
                        before when?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: Before the end of the
                        following week.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t remember
                        that. That wasn’t clear to me. That sure as hell wasn’t clear to me. He said
                        before the end of the <pb n="359" facs="0384" xml:id="pg_359"/>following
                        week, and I said: “Let’s say within two weeks, and he could come down
                        earlier.”</p>
                    <p>I don’t see what we gain. The earlier he’s down, the earlier they’ll be blown
                        up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: I agree.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Therefore, we
                        get him down early. I mean I’m trying to understand the reasoning. I saw
                        him—when?—Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: You saw him
                        Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If he had come
                        down on Monday or Tuesday the following week, it would still have been well
                        within the two weeks we talked about.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: If he comes down on
                        Friday, it can blow up on Monday. They’ll want to negotiate Saturday.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. They’ll stay
                        four or five days.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: If you’d like him to
                        put it off until Monday, we can see.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would much
                        prefer. The later the better. What do we gain by having this thing blow
                        up?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: We don’t.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Habib: Is it going to blow up, Harry?</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Habib: The latest thing <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        said—he made a public statement that he didn’t expect much to be done before
                        public elections. So he seems to be already preparing the public mood for
                        not much progress at this round.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: And they know we will
                        not talk about durations but they will talk to us about durations.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are we going to
                        talk about anything constructive?</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHW_1">Shlaudeman</persName>: Yes. We can talk
                        about land and water.</p>
                    <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: O.K.—if they’ve
                        been promised for Friday. But it wasn’t my impression that that’s what would
                        be done. O.K.<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4"><persName corresp="#p_BE_1"

                        1976</p>
                    <p>On Thursday, October 7th—the morning after the second <persName

                            >Ford</persName> debate—I attended Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s luncheon for the Foreign
                        Ministers of Latin America held at the Center for Inter-American Relations
                        in New York. Among those present at the luncheon was the Foreign Minister of
                        Panama, <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1">Aquilino Boyd</persName>, who has been
                        a friend of mine for some years and who previously served as his country’s
                        representative to the United Nations. When he greeted me at the luncheon,
                        Boyd asked whether I would speak with him privately, and I did so after the
                        luncheon. He expressed his “great concern” about the comments made by
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> with respect to Panama in
                        the course of the second debate, and he told me that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had earlier assured him that the
                        negotiations would be resumed within a couple of weeks along the lines of
                        the principles already agreed upon.<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note> He indicated particular
                        anxiety with reference to Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s statements on Panama and asked whether I knew
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> well enough to be
                        able to give him some reassurances on that score.</p>
                    <p>I did undertake to assure him as to the commitment of Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to the improvement of US-Latin
                        American relations and said that it was my firm conviction that he would be
                        approaching all hemispheric issues—including Panama—in a spirit of
                        cooperation and understanding. Boyd told me that he appreciated this, but
                        that his President (with whom he had just talked) was anxious and “deeply
                        disturbed” and he hoped something might be done to avoid exacerbation of the
                        problem in Panama. He described the problem as “explosive” and
                        “dangerous”.</p>
                    <p>Later on I telephoned <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName> and
                        passed on to him the substance of the concern which had been expressed to
                        me.</p>
                    <p>During the next several days I talked with a number of Latin American
                        Ambassadors and other leaders who indicated their own anxiety about the
                        nature of the negotiations with respect to the Panama <pb n="361"
                            facs="0386" xml:id="pg_361"/>Canal in the light of the observations made
                        in the course of the Foreign Policy debate.</p>
                    <p>On October 14th I telephoned to <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Richard
                            Holbrooke</persName> at Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s headquarters in Atlanta and talked to him about the
                        situation. <persName corresp="#p_HR_1">Dick Holbrooke</persName> suggested
                        that he thought it would be helpful for me to telephone Foreign Minister
                        Boyd in Panama—entirely on my own—to reaffirm my conviction that Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> would be approaching
                        US-Latin American relations out of a real interest in Latin America and with
                        a desire to establish a harmonious basis for hemispheric relationships. He
                        also suggested that I stress that Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> would want to give careful attention to various
                        aspects of US-Latin American relations at an early date after the election
                        and that he felt strongly that Latin America and its problems deserved our
                        serious concern.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of October 15th, 1976, I telephoned to Foreign Minister Boyd
                        in Panama. Set forth below is the substance of our conversation:</p>
                    <p>I told the Foreign Minister that I had been thinking about our conversation
                        in New York and especially the concerns which he had expressed. I said that
                        I had not talked to either Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> or members of his staff about our conversation but
                        that I did know Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and
                        did know Boyd and wanted to pass on some things of which the Foreign
                        Minister should be aware.</p>
                    <p>I told him that I believed Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> to be a man deeply committed to the improvement of
                        US-Latin American relations; that I knew him from personal experience to be
                        very interested in Latin America, a man who has travelled quite extensively
                        in the hemisphere, and one who speaks Spanish. I also said that I thought
                        that of all parts of the world Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> would probably feel most at home in Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>I also told the Foreign Minister that I know from my personal conversations
                        with Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that he is
                        concerned about the inadequate way we have been dealing with the concerns of
                        Latin America and with the fact that Latin American issues have had such a
                        low priority on our international agenda. I told Boyd that he could be
                        certain that Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is
                        friendly toward the aspirations of Latin America, that he is eager to
                        develop a relationship of mutual trust and respect, and that he recognizes
                        the importance of assuring that the countries of Latin America are treated
                        with the dignity to which they are entitled.</p>
                    <p>I then said that I knew the Foreign Minister recognized that we are in the
                        last 18 days of a presidential campaign and that he knew the United States
                        well enough to know that a nation’s policy cannot be formulated specifically
                        during an election battle. I pointed out that <pb n="362" facs="0387"
                            xml:id="pg_362"/>I was sure he also knew that this is the worst time to
                        discuss an issue of such consequence as Panama.</p>
                    <p>I concluded by saying that I merely wanted to assure the Foreign Minister—as
                        a friend and a colleague—that I was confident that Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> would want to give Latin American
                        concerns—including Panama—his early attention if he is elected and that he
                        would approach these difficult and often complex issues in a spirit of
                        cooperation and good will.<note n="3" xml:id="d136fn3">On December 27, in an
                            interview with reporters on St. Simons Island, Georgia, <persName

                            for a Panama Canal treaty “ought to be resolved quite rapidly.”
                                (“<persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Says He Will

                    <p>Foreign Minister Boyd then responded:</p>
                    <p>“We have been, as you know, deeply concerned about the comments made by
                        Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> in the course of the
                        debate. We are especially concerned that it might mean that he would be

                        report it to our President.</p>

                        States during a Presidential election, but it is very important that we know
                        what comes after the campaign. We are realists and I believe that Governor
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> will be elected.<note

                            >Carter</persName> that the backbone of this whole problem, in our

                    <p>“Meanwhile, it has been very helpful for you to have given us your comments
                        about Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        position—especially because it comes from someone who is such a good friend
                        of Latin America and our country. Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName> should know that we will now await the election
                        results in a friendly spirit.”</p>
                    <p>I then took the liberty of saying to the Foreign Minister that [1 line of
                        missing text] light of our conversation—if there were comments during the
                        next couple of weeks which were adverse to Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, and he said he understood.</p>

                    <p>The Foreign Minister again thanked me for telephoning, and repeated his
                        statement that he thought that the conversation had been very helpful and he
                        appreciated it.</p>
                    <p>Although the conversation was obviously extremely friendly and most
                        understanding, it is important to recognize that Boyd is the Foreign
                        Minister of this country and very likely not in a position to have a
                        decisive influence on what is said by President <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> or perhaps others in the Cabinet
                        about the issue. My strong impression is, however, that he will try to be
                        helpful in every way he can. Much will depend, of course, on whether there
                        are internal developments within Panama in the next two or three weeks which
                        could precipitate unfriendly actions or statements on the part of high
                        officials or others.<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">On December 1, <persName

                            corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> raised with me the status of
                        future US-Panama relations. On the first occasion he was entirely sober and
                        on the latter two extremely inebriated. However, at all times he was
                        entirely coherent and consistent. He became much more specific during the
                        last conversation which occurred in the early morning hours of October 24
                        and appeared to be saying more than he had initially intended to reveal. His
                        basic points were the following:</p>
                    <p>1. This round of negotiations is terminated. The statement made by the
                        Panamanian team on October 21 was a long way of saying “goodbye.”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d137fn2">The statement of October 21 provided an overview of the
                            Panamanian positions on each of the eight <persName corresp="#p_TJA_1"
                                >Tack</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            principles, stressed that the Canal issue was a global one, and argued
                            that the United States should act responsibly and conclude a settlement.

                    <p>2. Panama has already taken the decision to pursue other means than the
                        negotiations to achieve its ends. They are well advanced in the process of
                        developing a capability to create massive problems for the United States.
                        Their actions at this point are designed to prepare <pb n="365" facs="0390"
                            xml:id="pg_365"/>the country for the upcoming action which will occur
                        within the next year. He stated he was not speaking of another set of
                        1964-like riots. Their capabilities were far beyond that. They were prepared
                        to do things the U.S. could not imagine. They recognize that many
                        Panamanians will be killed and that other serious actions will be taken
                        against them. But they are counting on U.S. public opinion refusing to
                        accept the consequences of an organized struggle. He stated that after both
                        countries had suffered massively, the U.S. will ultimately send negotiators
                        (and they will not be the present ones) who will be fully empowered to
                        negotiate the final withdrawal of the U.S. from Panama. “These negotiations
                        will be completed within 15 days.”</p>
                    <p>3. He stated he was telling me this as a friend not as a negotiator. He
                        personally had made great efforts to find a creative, diplomatic way to
                        “arrange” the problem and recognized the efforts of the U.S. team in this
                        regard. But we have both failed and the result is now inevitable. He advised
                        that the members of the U.S. team take the personal steps necessary to avoid
                        to the extent possible becoming the scapegoats in the U.S. for the disaster
                        that will occur in the next year.</p>
                    <p>I responded by noting that such a course of action would be extremely risky
                        for the Panamanian Government, both in terms of the U.S. response it would
                        provoke and, perhaps more importantly for them, the probability that they
                        would unleash forces within Panama which they could not control and which
                        would ultimately bring about their own downfall. <persName
                            corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> stated that the highest levels of
                        the Panamanian Government recognize these risks but had determined to take
                        them. They simply have no other viable options at this point. The situation
                        is like a Greek tragedy where tragic flaws in both countries were leading to
                        mutual disaster. He is an old man and may well end up in jail next year if
                        the risks they are taking come to pass. He has no choice but to accept this
                        fate. But many members of the U.S. team are young and have a future to
                        protect. We therefore should look to covering ourselves as best we can.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether he could see anything that either or both negotiating teams
                        could do at this point to avoid the situation he was postulating. He replied
                        that there was absolutely nothing either side could do at this point.
                        Nothing we could do in the negotiations would affect the situation. Forces
                        are moving in Panama, decisions have been made and there is no turning back.
                        After January, events could begin to manifest themselves.</p>
                    <p>The conversation ended with reiterated warnings from the U.S. side that
                        Panama not underestimate the capabilities of the United States and the risks
                        inherent in Panama’s own domestic situation. <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1"
                            >Escobar</persName> repeated the fatalistic theme that whatever the
                        risks, the forces had now been unleashed that make the result
                        inevitable.</p>
                    <pb n="366" facs="0391" xml:id="pg_366"/>
                    <p>COMMENT: During the first conversations and the earlier part of the last one,
                            <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> limited himself to a
                        warning that the failure to make progress in the negotiations was leading to
                        a confrontation. The implication of this approach seemed to be that the U.S.
                        should be more flexible and that the U.S. team had a personal stake in
                        avoiding a failure. But as the last conversation developed, he seemed to
                        lose sight of his original objective (if indeed his objective was to press
                        us for more flexibility) and adopted the approach that we should not bother
                        with the negotiations, but should take whatever steps we could as
                        individuals to avoid taking the blame for the U.S. foreign policy disaster
                        that is now inevitable.</p>
                    <p>The overall impression was that although Panama is advancing threats designed
                        to convince the U.S. to meet their demands in the negotiations, <persName
                            corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> at least has made the assessment
                        that the U.S. will not be able to do so within the requisite time-frame.
                        Accordingly, he sees little point in arguing with us further and has
                        resigned himself to the consequences of an impasse.</p>

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General.</hi> During the period 19–26 October 1976, I
                        traveled to Panama with the United States negotiating team for the purpose
                        of resuming discussions with the Panamanians on the unresolved issues in the
                        negotiations. There were, in all, three meetings of the two full <pb n="367"
                            facs="0392" xml:id="pg_367"/>teams, along with several technical-level
                        meetings on the issue of lands and waters.<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d137fn1">footnote 1, Document 137</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Negotiating Sessions</hi></p>
                    <p>a. At the first negotiating session the Panamanian team presented a lengthy
                        statement of their positions on the major issues. In this statement the
                        Panamanian team reiterated their insistence on the year 2000 as the
                        termination date “for all purposes” of the new treaty.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d138fn3">See <ref target="#d137fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                137</ref>.</note> They acknowledged that the United States team was
                        not in a position to address the issue of duration and expressed their
                        willingness to proceed with discussions on other issues but only with the
                        understanding that anything Panama might propose or accept in principle
                        would be subject to ultimate agreement by the United States that the treaty
                        will have a term of no longer than the year 2000. The United States team
                        merely accepted the statement without substantive comment.</p>
                    <p>b. At the second negotiating session the United States team did not comment
                        on the details of the Panamanian statement. Rather, the United States team
                        offered only a general response. In addition, the issues of canal employees
                        and non-military activities were discussed.</p>
                    <p>(1) Response to Panama’s Statement. The United States team emphasized that
                        the platforms of both political parties in the United States supported the
                        negotiations, that the next move in the process of seeking a formula for
                        accommodation rests with the United States, that at the next round the
                        United States team hopes to present their views on how the interests of both
                        nations can be accommodated, and that it should not be inferred from the
                        response of the United States team that the United States accepts the
                        critical component of Panama’s statement—which was termination of the new
                        treaty for all purposes at the year 2000. The United States team then turned
                        the meeting to a discussion of two issues—the status and rights of United
                        States national employees of the new entity and certain non-military
                        activities that are presently conducted in the Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>(2) Canal Employees. On the issue of canal employees, the United States team
                        urged early resolution of this issue in the negotiations in order that
                        certain meaningful assurances could be made to present employees of the
                        Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government concerning their future situation
                        under a new treaty with Panama. In this connection, the United States team
                        presented its position on this issue, which is that United States national
                        employees of the entity should enjoy the same rights and privileges as the
                        civilian component under the initialed Status of Forces Agreement—to include
                        the area of <pb n="368" facs="0393" xml:id="pg_368"/>primary rights to
                        exercise criminal jurisdiction. This represented a hardening of the position
                        the negotiators had presented since November 1975<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d138fn4">See <ref target="#d104">Documents 104</ref> and <ref
                                target="#d105">105</ref>.</note> and a return to the position
                        presented by the United States team on this issue in September 1975.<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d138fn5">See <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note>
                        The Panamanian team agreed to address this issue on a priority basis, and,
                        in this connection, the United States team presented two sets of draft
                        threshold agreement language that embodied its position for Panama’s
                        consideration. In addition, the United States team presented to the
                        Panamanian negotiators a list of assurances designed for canal employees,
                        for Panama’s consideration, and asked that Panama agree to these assurances
                        in order that they could be made public as soon as possible. Panama accepted
                        all three papers and agreed to consider them carefully and respond at the
                        next round.</p>
                    <p>(3) Non-Military Activities. On the issue of non-military activities, which
                        are those activities of the United States Government presently performed in
                        the Canal Zone and other than Panama Canal Company/Canal Zone Government and
                        military activities, the United States team proposed that the question of
                        these activities be addressed by a technical group composed of one member
                        from the United States Embassy in Panama and one or more Government of
                        Panama representatives. This technical group would begin meeting as soon as
                        possible to review the special circumstances and problems posed for each
                        individual agency by a new Canal treaty that eliminates the Canal Zone and
                        thus those agencies’ legal basis for operating. The Panamanians agreed that
                        such a step would be desirable and the United States team presented a draft
                        of the terms of reference for such a technical group for Panama’s
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>c. The unofficial negotiators lands and waters position was presented to the
                        Panamanian team on 25 October at the final negotiating session. The package
                        provided the Panamanians consisted of: (1) a map; (2) a description of each
                        land and waters parcel; (3) terms for administration of the military areas
                        of coordination; and (4) United States land and water use rights for the
                        operation, maintenance, and sanitation of the Canal.</p>
                    <p>d. The United States team presented a detailed briefing on the land and
                        waters position to the full Panamanian team. General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName>’s briefing emphasized the following
                        fundamental aspects of the United States position:</p>
                    <pb n="369" facs="0394" xml:id="pg_369"/>
                    <p>(1) The position is “what if”, does not represent any approved United States
                        position, and goes beyond our Government’s guidance and the negotiators’
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>(2) This position represents a major concession for the United States.</p>
                    <p>(3) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> will expect
                        corresponding accommodations by Panama on issues the United States
                        negotiators feel are important.</p>
                    <p>(4) Without such concessions, it will not be approved in Washington.</p>
                    <p>(5) This position assumes that the defense of the Canal will be carried out
                        jointly by Panamanian and United States Forces from whatever areas are
                        required in the Republic of Panama.</p>
                    <p>After a two-hour description of the package, General <persName
                            corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> concluded by suggesting a careful
                        review of the position followed by technical level meetings in Panama.
                        Minister Boyd’s response was noncommittal. He did ask a number of specific
                        questions, some of which appeared to be politically motivated.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Summary.</hi> The attitude of the Panamanians was cool
                        and completely official in contrast to a more relaxed, informal attitude
                        during previous negotiating sessions. In part, this reflects the serious
                        economic situation in Panama. The Panamanians consider progress on a new
                        treaty as an essential ingredient for investor confidence needed to improve
                        the economy.<note n="6" xml:id="d138fn6">Bell and <persName

                    <p>Our conversation naturally began with the mandatory speculations on the
                        American elections. Soon thereafter it turned to the second most popular
                        political subject in town—the recent bombings in the Canal Zone.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d139fn2">The bombings in the Canal Zone took place on October 31
                            and November 1. There were no injuries. The first bomb damaged the car
                            of <persName corresp="#p_DWR_1">William Drummond</persName>, a Panama
                            Canal Zone employee who had filed suit against President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to halt the treaty
                            negotiations. (“Bomb Wrecks Car in Canal Zone; Owner Sued to Bar Canal
                            Deal,” <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> November 1, 1976, p.
                            4) See also <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> I said that
                        the bombings were unfortunate for two reasons; 1) they were deplorable in
                        themselves—whoever did them, and 2) exacerbated the existing state of
                        mistrust and even hatred between American residents of the Canal Zone and
                        Panamanians. <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName> readily
                        agreed, adding that he expected further violence, probably as a form of
                        revenge. He said that he was not alone among Panamanians in expecting an
                        outbreak of bombings in Panama City.</p>
                    <p>I said that the timing of the bombings was unfortunate in a number of
                        respects. I asked if he were familiar with the remarks which “a certain
                        member of the Panamanian negotiating team” had made with respect to the
                        future of U.S.-Panamanian relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note> He responded that he was
                        aware that <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Romulo Escobar</persName>
                        Bethancourt had spoken about this subject to members of the American
                        negotiating team, but that <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>’s
                        remarks had been misinterpreted, he thought. “As I told Bill Jorden last
                        night,” <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> only informed Morey
                        Bell of his view that the chief negotiators should follow the example of
                        General <persName corresp="#p_DWG_1">Dolvin</persName> in making proposals,
                        trying them out in Washington and then coming back with new proposals.</p>
                    <p>I responded that <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName> may indeed
                        have said such things to Minister Bell, but he also indicated that the
                        Panamanian presentation <pb n="371" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_371"/>in the most
                        recent round was a lengthy farewell and that the U.S. could now expect
                        trouble. I added that there was a danger that some Americans would add the
                        ‘2’ of <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>’s statement with the
                        ‘2’ of the bombings in the Zone and come up with a ‘4’ which, however
                        unjustified, could damage the interests of both Panama and the U.S. I noted
                        that several members of the American team had heard <persName
                            corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>’s remarks on four different
                        occasions, and they all agreed what he had said.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName> then went into a
                        defense of <persName corresp="#p_EBR_1">Escobar</persName>. “I used to have
                        personal reasons for disliking Romulo”, but that is now over. It is
                        important for the Panamanian team to continue to have “people like Romulo
                        and Ahumada”. “They have <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’
                        ear,” he said, and can “make decisions”—something which other negotiators
                        presumably could not.</p>
                    <p>He asked if I had had any reports on the recent cabinet meetings at which
                        President Lakas raised this general issue of the negotiations. I said I had
                        not. He said that Lakas “supported <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1"
                            >Aquilino</persName>’s position,” i.e., continuation of the negotiations
                        on the same basis they have been taking place. Lopez said that he (Lopez)
                        was of the same mind.</p>
                    <p>In answer to a question, Lopez said that he is very pessimistic about the
                        progress of the negotiations. He said that both sides need to take a much
                        bolder and imaginative position, reflecting a determination to complete a
                        treaty by the summer of 1977. He expressed contempt for a number of the U.S.
                        proposals in the recent round. He said the “employees’ bill of rights” put
                        forward by the U.S. had already been rejected and furthermore did not
                        respond to the real problems of PanCanal’s employees. I said that I thought
                        that Minister Bell had gotten a good feel for the views of PanCanal
                        employees during his recent visit. <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1"
                            >Lopez-Guevara</persName> also threw cold water on the idea of a new
                        conceptual agreement. “Conceptual agreements never lead anywhere,” he said.
                        “If we get a new conceptual agreement, we are still at kilometer zero.” For
                        example, he said, a conceptual agreement is likely to say something like:
                        “The entity which will run the canal shall be a U.S. Government agency or
                        otherwise.” It is now time to start writing a treaty,” he said. I objected
                        that much of the spadework for difficult and intricate problems such as the
                        functions of the entity and employee rights had not yet been done. He
                        acknowledged this with a shrug.</p>
                    <p>The conversation turned to the economic situation in Panama. I observed that
                        the situation was not good. <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1"
                            >Lopez-Guevara</persName> added, “And getting worse.” He criticized
                        Minister of Planning and Economic Policy Barletta for “squandering” Panama’s
                        money on long-range high-cost projects of dubious value. He also criticized,
                        though by implication, statist thinking by many leaders of the Panamanian
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>In summary, <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Lopez-Guevara</persName> is very
                        pessimistic about the future public order situation, the negotiations and
                        the economy.</p>

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Background.</hi> Between 31 October and 1 November,
                        three explosions took place in the Panama Canal Zone. Although no personal
                        injuries resulted, at least nine cars and some property were damaged. The
                        explosions have, of course, drawn great attention from all elements of the
                        U.S. Government concerned with the security of the Canal Zone. At last
                        report, the Governor of the Canal Zone had requested that the United States
                        Southern Command provide sufficient troops to defend the canal area.</p>
                    <p>3. The Panamanian press is currently accusing the Zonians themselves of
                        plotting to create a situation wherein they appear martyrs. At the same
                        time, leaflets are circulating in Panama claiming that an ultra-nationalist
                        anti-U.S. group is taking credit for the bombings. However, two
                        disseminations, one from a highly sensitive Agency source, the second from
                        an equally sensitive source of the U.S. Army’s 470th Military Intelligence
                        Group, report that the Chief of the <gloss target="#t_GN_1">GN</gloss>/G–2,
                        Lt. Col. <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName>, himself ordered
                        the bombing attacks and occasioned the distribution of the diversionary
                        leaflets as part of a harassment campaign against the Canal Zone. According
                        to the Agency <pb n="373" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_373"/>report, Lt. Col.
                            <persName corresp="#p_NMMA_1">Noriega</persName> almost certainly had
                        the approval of the Chief of Government, Brigadier Omar <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> for such an action. Although the
                        Agency and Army reports vary somewhat on the actual individuals involved in
                        the technical aspects of the bombings, it is clear that most if not all of
                        these technicians have at one time or another received ordnance training
                        from the U.S. Army or U.S. AID. Additionally, one of the individuals
                        mentioned was among the twelve trainees who attended an Agency sponsored
                        course on terrorist devices, threats, and response, held in the United
                        States from 5 to 30 July 1976.</p>

                        representatives of the Cuban and Israeli intelligence services. Clearly,
                        this second-most powerful man in Panama is no one’s agent. He is a ruthless
                        opportunist whose only loyalties lie with himself and Panama.</p>

                        in late October when, as legislative chairman of the Canal Zone AFL–CIO, he
                        filed suit in the Zone’s U.S. District Court for the purpose of halting
                        canal treaty negotiations. Sometime earlier, Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DWR_1">Drummond</persName> had testified before a U.S.
                        Congressional Committee in opposition to the negotiation of a new canal
                        treaty with Panama. He had also authored correspondence on Panama based on
                        information he claimed to have received from someone with access to the
                        files of the 470th Military Intelligence Group; and Congresswoman <persName
                            corresp="#p_SLK_1">Leonor Sullivan</persName> subsequently drew from
                        this correspondence when presenting questions on Panama to the National

                        him this morning:</p>
                    <p>—Two key issues are critical to winning Senate acceptance of a new canal
                        treaty: (1) convincing Senators of the need for a revised relationship, and
                        (2) adequate Canal defense arrangements that are endorsed by the Defense
                        Department. A treaty that would terminate by the year 2000 would probably be
                        saleable so long as the post-2000 defense provisions had Defense’s full
                        support. All other issues (form of the entity, compensation—including need
                        for appropriations) are subsidiary and would probably be supported by the
                        Senate if the two basic requirements are met.</p>
                    <p>—President-elect <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> might well
                        find it easier to proceed on the canal question if he were presented upon
                        taking office with a comprehensive treaty package (or at least a conceptual
                        agreement accepted by both the U.S. and Panama).</p>
                    <p>—We should go forward with plans to organize steering groups among key
                        staffers in both the Senate and the House in the pre-inaugural period. (We
                        intend to do this and will start within the next week to ten days.)</p>

                    <p>275270. From the Secretary. Subject: Panama Canal Negotiations: Bombings.
                        Ref: Panama 7529.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">See <ref target="#d140fn3"
                                >footnote 3, Document 140</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>1. I share your concern about the potentially tragic and far-reaching
                        consequences of the harassment program which <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> appears to have adopted on the mistaken assumption
                        that bombs will somehow speed the course of the negotiations. I am
                        particularly concerned by the potential for loss of life which, if it should
                        occur, could cause a rupture in our relations and seriously delay the
                        negotiating process.</p>
                    <p>2. I believe that the option set forth in the first portion of para 3C reftel
                        comes closest to my thinking in presenting the matter to <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>. A variation of it has the
                        greatest potential for eliminating the threat to lives and property while at
                        the same time preserving our flexibility for the future.</p>
                    <p>3. Suggest therefore that you proceed in the following manner:</p>
                    <p>(A) Arrange for a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName>. We believe that there is considerable value in
                        working through Lakas who may be a moderating influence. You may wish
                        therefore to ask Lakas to arrange the meeting and join with you. Assuming
                        that you agree, you should ask that the meeting be private with only the
                        three of you present. Make certain that both <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> and Lakas understand you are seeking this
                        appointment on my personal instruction and that I consider it a matter of
                        highest priority.</p>
                    <p>(B) Inform <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> that we have the
                        gravest suspicions—difficult as it is for us to believe—that recent bombings
                        in the Canal Zone have been the work of members of the National Guard. While
                        we assume these developments have occurred without <persName
                            corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>’ knowledge, we thought he should
                        be aware of our very grave concern about the implications of Guard
                        involvement. Surely <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName>
                        perceives the serious ramifications that would result throughout the entire
                        range of our bilateral relationship should any evidence of Guard involvement
                        in <pb n="376" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_376"/>this matter be confirmed. If
                        such an action occurs again, we would have no choice but to end all
                            negotiations.<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">In a November 5 memorandum to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, <persName

                                >Luers</persName> added a fourth option, endorsed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_JWJ_1">Jorden</persName>: “Follow option 3 but tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> that we are
                            suspending the negotiations pending receipt of his assurance that no
                            further acts of terrorism will occur.” (National Archives, <gloss

                    <p>(C) If <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1">Torrijos</persName> should react as you
                        have predicted by attempting to blame Canal residents or U.S. intelligence
                        agencies, you should hear him out and then reply firmly that we were aware
                        of this possibility, have examined it thoroughly and have reluctantly
                        concluded that it does not allay our suspicions of involvement by members of
                        the Guard.<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">In telegram 7680 from Panama City,

                            Guard was behind the bombings, emphasizing that the démarche “could be

                        In a low key manner, you should also point out that while the perpetrators
                        of these incidents apparently were careful not to cause personal injuries,
                        this was no guarantee that injuries or deaths could not have occurred.</p>

                    <p>Lopez said he had instructions from the “treaty commission” to ask several

                    <p>The first issue was “defense rights and neutrality”. Only recently, he
                        explained, had Panama fully realized that the conclusion of a treaty almost
                        certainly hinged on a Panamanian concession of major proportions respecting
                        this issue. He explained further that the <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1"
                            >Jorden</persName>-Bell conversation with President Lakas had been
                            critical.<note n="2" xml:id="d143fn2">Not further identified.</note></p>
                    <p>Could the United States consider a formula whereby defense rights/neutrality
                        could be “covered” for a five-year period beyond the treaty’s expiration,
                        with a provision that the “coverage” would be “reviewed” at the end of five
                        years and perhaps extended for another five, it being understood that the
                        review process could continue thereafter. I asked, first, whether he was
                        talking about a joint United States-Panama “guarantee” or “arrangement”. He
                        said, “Yes, only the United States and Panama”. I then asked whether he was
                        talking about a troop presence. He said, “No troops, but maybe a base”. I
                        replied that even if there were just a base, there would have to be people
                        to maintain it. He answered by saying Panama and the United States could
                        contract with those people.</p>
                    <p>I said that we always warmly welcome any ideas or initiatives from Panama,
                        and that what he had just proposed was an interesting idea. He then
                        interjected to say that the treaty commission is actively studying various
                        formulae for resolving this problem quickly. I said that that was good to
                        hear.</p>
                    <p>He said “they” had another idea. What about some arrangement for extending
                        United States participation in Canal operation beyond the treaty period, but
                        with Panama having the majority? He explained <pb n="378" facs="0403"
                            xml:id="pg_378"/>that this might somehow be helpful in resolving the
                        defense rights/neutrality problem. I said that that was another interesting
                        idea.</p>
                    <p>His third idea, he said, would probably surprise the United States. What
                        about a formula whereby the United States would issue a unilateral
                        declaration—as part of the overall treaty package—which would state that the
                        United States would regard any threat to the continuous, safe, efficient,
                        and neutral operation of the Canal as a threat to the United States, and
                        would act to counter it by means of its constitutional processes? There
                        could also be an initialed “negotiating minute” which would reflect that the
                        United States had queried Panama on whether it objected to such a unilateral
                        declaration, and reflect that Panama had stated that it had no
                        objection.</p>
                    <p>I said that that was indeed somewhat of a surprising formula, and that it
                        seemed to me that what he was suggesting constituted in effect an extension
                        or adumbration of the Monroe Doctrine. He said that that was so. I asked how
                        in the world Panama could possibly swallow that sort of thing politically.
                        He replied smilingly that the Panamanian mentality works in mysterious ways,
                        and that such a formula could conceivably be salable.</p>
                    <p>I said that it might be useful to probe these ideas further, but that Panama
                        should understand two things. First, the United States negotiators have no
                        authority whatever to pursue the defense rights/neutrality/duration problems
                        at this time, and that they are in the position of needing signals from the
                        President-elect. Second, the United States negotiators were exceedingly
                        reluctant to enter into any “what if” conversations with Panama any more,
                        because they could never have any assurance that their conversations would
                        not reach the public domain quickly. Lopez said he and other members of his
                        team fully understand both points.</p>
                    <p>Lopez then turned to an intense, serious commentary on the negotiating
                        procedures. He said that the format of formal meetings of the two teams
                        across a table had done much to preclude any informal chats and probing
                        sessions between individual members of the two teams—sessions of the sort
                        which produced new ideas, new formulae, that cannot be laid on the table
                        officially. He said it seemed to Panama that the United States had chosen
                        deliberately to eschew such informal encounters. The United States, he said,
                        just seems not to want to get down to real talks. Could anything be done to
                        change this situation?</p>
                    <p>I said that the United States negotiators in fact very much want to have the
                        sort of encounters he was suggesting, but had felt that Panama did not want
                        them because Panama wanted its entire team to hear everything, and engage in
                        everything. I said also that we were a little reluctant to go into such
                        talks because we had been so persistently and badly singed by revelations.
                        He said he understood, and would see if “something can be done”.</p>
                    <pb n="379" facs="0404" xml:id="pg_379"/>
                    <p>I asked him whether Panama had any idea of broaching the foregoing subjects
                        during the next round. He replied by saying “Would you object if we took the
                        initiative?” I said only that this round was supposed to be “symbolic”, and
                        one designed to “clear away the underbrush”. </p>

                        12/3/76, 4:00 pm—Summary.</p>
                    <p>1. Boyd delivered a private letter from <persName corresp="#p_THOE_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> on the bombings which again rejected the
                        allegations of National Guard involvement and “advised” the United States
                        against making “threats” to Panama.<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d142fn4">footnote 4, Document 142</ref>.</note> The
                        Secretary affirmed that the United States is not threatening Panama, but
                        added that our information is highly credible and we will not reveal it.
                        Both agreed that this affair should now be closed without public disclosure.
                        The Secretary reminded the Minister, however, that we take this matter
                        seriously.</p>
                    <p>2. On the negotiations the Secretary volunteered that he would send <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> to Panama again, probably before
                        Christmas—to “clean up remaining underbrush” and to “symbolize in a positive
                        way the continuity of the United States commitment to the negotiation.” Boyd
                        was gratified.</p>
                    <p>3. The Secretary emphasized, however, that it would be for the new
                        administration to make the final, critical decisions, and he could in no way
                        speak for it. “I cannot saddle them with major moves.”</p>
                    <p>4. He added that the United States basic, remaining concern is with Canal
                        “defense.” Agreement on Canal operation seemed within reach. He declined to
                        explain this administration’s present thinking on the duration issue to
                        Boyd, saying no useful purpose would be served thereby.</p>
                    <pb n="380" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_380"/>
                    <p>5. Responding to Boyd’s persistent queries respecting the new
                        administration’s posture vis-à-vis the negotiations, the Secretary said he
                        had spoken to the President-elect on Panama; he would be suggesting that
                        Secretary-designate <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> give
                        resolution of this problem a high priority;<note n="3" xml:id="d144fn3">See

                            8444 from Panama City, December 14, the Embassy reported that Boyd had
                            claimed that “the Panamanian positions on the treaty were passed on to
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> through

                            >Jorden</persName>’s memoirs state that the Commission on United

                                >Linowitz</persName>, provided <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> with a copy of its report on the Western
                            Hemisphere, which made “early completion of a treaty with Panama a
                            primary recommendation.” According to <persName corresp="#p_JWJ_1"
                                >Jorden</persName>, President-elect <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> also received a copy of the report, which he read
                            “over the Christmas holidays.” (<hi rend="italic">Panama Odyssey</hi>,
                            p. 341)</note> and he would do all he could to keep the matter from
                        becoming a partisan one in the United States.</p>
                    <p>6. Over the past year Panama has shown great patience and wisdom, he
                        explained, and it seemed to him that 1977 was the opportune time for
                        concluding a new treaty. He felt that optimism is in order. So did Boyd. The
                        Secretary warned that confrontational circumstances would certainly not
                        help, however. Boyd said his government is not looking for them.</p>
                    <p>Comment: The exchange was pleasant enough but restrained. First names were
                        not used. Though the bombing episode seemed to have been put to rest, it
                        lingered in the air. For once Boyd did not talk right past the Secretary,
                        but listened.</p>
                    <p>Obviously the Minister was pleased at the prospect of <persName
                            corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName>’s return, which his government had
                        been seeking vigorously. He expressed no disappointment with the Secretary’s
                        comment that this would be a symbolic, clearing-the-underbrush round of
                        talks.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> returned on December 18 from
                        his most recent negotiating round in Panama. The round met your limited
                        purposes—it produced no surprises and yielded some progress in “clearing
                        away the underbrush”.</p>
                    <p>The Panamanians were clearly pleased by the team’s presence. Indeed, in their
                        eyes the process of meeting was perhaps the most important accomplishment of
                        the round.</p>
                    <p>During the talks Panama displayed a flexibility, not apparent for some time,
                        that is perhaps bred of its current economic and fiscal problems and
                        consequent desire for a prompt treaty.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#p_BE_1">Bunker</persName> and other members of the team
                        received strong signals that we would get what we wanted concerning a
                        neutrality guarantee, long term protection of our security interests in the
                        Canal and other US requirements if we could accept a treaty termination by
                        the year 2000. Panama indicated a flexibility and willingness to accommodate
                        our desires in other areas:</p>

                    <p>—They appeared receptive to our informal ideas concerning the process for
                        treaty drafting which would start at some still undetermined date.</p>

                        which the canal operating entity will perform, and the treatment of selected
                        non-military activities such as the Federal Aviation Agency and the

                    <p>1. The following information was obtained from [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                    <p>2. As of mid-December 1976 Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BLAE_1"
                            >Aquilino Boyd Guardia</persName> and other members of the Panamanian
                        canal treaty negotiating team had prepared working papers containing three
                        alternative treaty clauses dealing with the issues of canal neutrality, free
                        passage and canal defense after the year 2000. The working papers were
                        prepared by Boyd; <persName corresp="#p_LGC_1">Carlos Lopez
                            Guevara</persName>, treaty negotiator; and <persName corresp="#p_ISJE_1"
                            >Jorge Illueca Sibauste</persName>, Ambassador to the United Nations.
                        Boyd requested the proposed treaty clauses on the presumption that the
                        United States might be willing to accept the year 2000 as the duration
                        period of the new canal treaty if Panama gave sufficiently broad guarantees
                        to the United States regarding the right of free passage after the year
                        2000.</p>
                    <p>3. The Panamanian negotiators probably will not discuss the proposed
                        alternative treaty clauses among themselves until late January 1977. Once a
                        final draft has been agreed upon, it will be forwarded to General Omar

                            in the maintenance of the neutrality and security of the Panama Canal;
                            as well as their concern for the peace and security of the nations.
                            Therefore, they attribute a great importance to the coordination of the
                            actions of their governments in the fight for international peace. To
                            this end, the two parties agree to consult with each other regularly at
                            various levels in relation to all important matters of reciprocal
                            concern. In the case that situations arise which in the judgment of both
                            parties constitute a threat to peace or a violation of the peace, the
                            two contracting parties will enter immediately into communication for
                            the purpose of coordinating their positions to the end of eliminating
                            the threat which has arisen or to restore the peace. (Article 7 of the
                            Accord of Friendship and Cooperation between the United Arab Republic
                            and the USSR, 27 May 1971, and Article 7 of the Accord of Friendship and

                            and shall have a five-year term of duration, renewable by means of an
                            exchange of notes, for successive periods of one year each. (Article 11

                    <p>A) The United States would ask Panama: The United States delegation wishes to
                        ask the Panamanian delegation if it has some objection to a declaration to
                        be formulated by the United States in the following terms: ‘The United
                        States declares that any attack on the Panama Canal or any threat of attack
                        on the same will be considered by the United States as an attack or threat
                        of attack against the United States; in consequence, the United States will
                        respond in accord with its constitutional process in the form which it
                        judges most fitting.’</p>
                    <p>B) The Panamanian delegation would respond: ‘The Panamanian delegation has no
                        objection to the declaration which the United States may make in the terms
                        indicated in the question transcribed above, with the understanding that any
                        action of the United States within Panamanian territory shall depend on the
                        previous express consent of the republic of Panama.’”</p>

                    <p>6. The third alternative draft, prepared by Jorge Illueca, read as

                    <quote>“Without prejudice to the respect due the territorial integrity of
                        Panama, and to the end that any interruption of free transit of the canal be
                        avoided, the contracting parties shall agree to act with the objective that
                        the waterway forever remain open, efficient and neutral. In case of
                        disagreement, the contracting parties agree to refer immediately their
                        discrepancies to the Consultative Organ of the Organization of American
                        States (<gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>) for its urgent consideration,
                        and they agree also to comply with the decision effected by the said
