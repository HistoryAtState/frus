                <p>The Department of State released today <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the
                        United States</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume XXVIII, Southern Africa. Additional
                    volumes covering Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa, 1969–1972, are available
                    on the Department of State website. Documentation on U.S. policy towards North
                    Africa, 1973–1976, is scheduled for future publication on the Department of
                    State website.</p>
                <p>The volume contains four chapters (entitled Regional Issues, Portuguese Africa,
                    Angola, and Independence Negotiations), each documenting a segment of U.S.
                    policy toward Southern Africa during the presidencies of Richard Nixon and
                    Gerald Ford. The documentation reveals that both presidents pursued policies
                    designed to maintain stability in the region and to avoid domestic and
                    international criticism of U.S. ties to the white minority regimes in South
                    Africa and Southern Rhodesia. </p>
                <p>The chapter on Regional Issues covers South Africa, which both administrations
                    viewed as a bulwark against Communist expansion in the region. The documents
                    illustrate the tensions between the Nixon administration and the Congressional
                    Black Caucus and between the administration and the Department of State’s Bureau
                    of African Affairs in dealing with South Africa’s apartheid regime. They also
                    show a preference by Nixon and Henry Kissinger to avoid direct involvement in
                    the growing unrest in the region.</p>
                <p>The chapter on Portuguese Africa reflects the evolution of U.S. involvement in
                    Angola and Mozambique. Anxious to avoid alienating a key NATO partner, the Nixon
                    administration sought to persuade the Portuguese Government to address the
                    grievances of the black nationalist movements, while quietly granting limited
                    assistance to the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE) and
                    National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) leader Holden Roberto. U.S.
                    involvement increased dramatically in January 1975, when Portugal granted
                    independence to its African colonies. Concerns about Soviet expansion and Cuban
                    involvement led the United States to provide covert support to anti-Communist
                    forces in Angola.</p>
                <p>The chapter on Angola chronicles the continuation of U.S. support to
                    anti-Communist forces after the Portuguese departed in November 1975. Despite
                    substantial assistance and support from South Africa, Zaire, Zambia, and others,
                    the U.S. was unable to turn the tide in Angola. Congressional passage of the
                    Tunney Amendment in December 1975 cut off aid to Angola and effectively ended
                    U.S. support.</p>
                <p>The chapter on independence negotiations chronicles Kissinger’s effort to broker
                    a negotiated settlement to the conflicts in Namibia and Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Myra Burton. The volume and this press
                    release are available on the Office of the Historian website at <ref

                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing
                    a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the <hi rend="roman">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important decisions and
                    actions of the foreign policy of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard
                        M. Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald R.
                        Ford</persName>. The subseries provides a comprehensive documentary record
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of both administrations. This
                    volume documents the U.S. policy towards Southern Africa, 1969–1976. Although
                    both administrations developed policies that were discrete to the re<pb n="IV"
                        facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>gion, those policies often impacted other
                    countries on the continent. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administrations’ policies in
                    sub-Saharan Africa are covered in volumes E–5 and E–6.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for <hi
                        rend="roman">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1969–1976, Volume XXVIII</p>
                <p>This volume documents the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                    administrations toward Southern Africa. The volume does not cover all countries
                    in the region, but focuses on the countries where U.S. interests and concerns
                    were greatest. Both administrations were concerned about Communist influence in
                    sub-Saharan Africa and the potential for even greater encroachment as a result
                    of the nationalist insurgencies in Angola, Namibia, and Rhodesia. Growing
                    opposition to apartheid presented another, thornier challenge, due to South
                    Africa’s dominance and influence in the region as well as their stalwart
                    opposition to Communism.</p>
                <p>The first chapter documents the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration’s policy discussions and decisions for Namibia, South Africa, and
                    Rhodesia. These policies evolved and changed throughout the course of both
                    administrations under pressure from the British, the Front Line Presidents
                        (<persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                        >Nyerere</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>, and
                    Kama), the United Nations and the U.S. Congress. Despite these pressures,
                    neither administration directly condemned the South African Government over
                    apartheid or their administration of Southwest Africa. Both Presidents sought to
                    maintain a constructive relationship with a strategic partner they viewed as
                    necessary to preserve stability in a volatile region.</p>
                <p>The second chapter, on Portuguese Africa, begins with the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration’s efforts to persuade the
                    Portuguese Government to improve their relations with black African countries
                    and the insurgents in Angola and Mozambique, without antagonizing an important
                    NATO ally. Much of the chapter is devoted to the evolution of U.S. involvement
                    in Angola, particularly following the Alvor Agreement in January 1975. The
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration’s covert action
                    in Angola is covered from a policy rather than operational perspective. The
                    chapter ends with the official departure of the Portuguese on November 11,
                    1975.</p>
                <p>The third chapter chronicles the deteriorating prospects for both UNITA and the
                    FNLA in light of major gains by the MPLA and their Cuban allies. It documents
                    the administration’s attempts to continue support for <persName
                        corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                        >Jonas Savimbi</persName> despite conditions on the ground in Angola and the
                    passage of the Tunney Amendment on December 19, 1975. Finally, the chapter
                    covers deliberations leading to the termination of the covert action program in
                    Angola, debate over the establishment of diplomatic relations, and Angola’s
                    admission to the United Nations.</p>
                <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>
                <p>The final chapter documents the administration’s efforts to broker a negotiated
                    settlement to the conflicts in Rhodesia and Namibia. The majority of the chapter
                    covers the negotiations on Rhodesia, where <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> worked with and through the British, South Africans,
                    and the Front Line Presidents to bring <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                        Smith</persName> and the black nationalists to the negotiating table.
                    Despite an intensive effort that resulted in a framework for negotiations and
                    the convening of a conference to produce an interim government, the participants
                    failed to reach an agreement.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The documents
                    are reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents
                    within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the
                    editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words repeated in telegrams to avoid garbling
                    or provide emphasis are silently corrected. Words or phrases underlined in the
                    original document are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are
                    preserved as found in the original text, and a list of abbreviations is included
                    in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after

                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 U.S.C. 2111 note), the National Archives and Records
                    Administration (NARA) has custody of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The requirements of the

                    PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to review for
                    additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the privacy rights

                    since these officials were not given the opportunity to separate their personal

                    recordings is governed by the terms of the PRMPA and an access agreement with
                    the Office of Presidential Libraries of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Estate. In
                    February 1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> initiated
                    a voice activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House and,
                    subsequently, in the President’s Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp
                    David, the Cabinet Room, and White House and Camp David telephones. The
                    audiotapes include conversations of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> with his Assistant for National Security Affairs,
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, other White House
                    aides, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>, other
                    Cabinet officers, members of Congress, and key foreign officials. The clarity of
                    the voices on the tape recordings is often very poor, but the editor has made
                    every effort to verify the accuracy of the transcripts produced here. Readers
                    are advised that the tape recording is the official document; the transcript
                    represents an interpretation of that document. Through the use of digital audio
                    and other advances in technology, the Office of the Historian has been able to
                    enhance the tape recordings and over time produce more accurate transcripts. The
                    result is that some transcripts printed here may differ from transcripts of the
                    same conversations printed in previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes. The most accurate transcripts possible, however, cannot substitute for
                    listening to the recordings. Readers are urged to consult the recordings
                    themselves for a full appreciation of those aspects of the conversations that
                    cannot be captured in a transcript, such as the speakers’ inflections and
                    emphases that may convey nuances of meaning, as well as the larger context of
                    the discussion.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information, and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State and
                    other concerned agencies of the U.S. Government. The declassification review of
                    this volume, which began in <pb n="VIII" facs="0009" xml:id="pg_VIII"/>2006 and
                    was completed in 2009, resulted in the decision to withhold 2 documents in full,
                    excisions of a paragraph or more in 13 documents, and minor excisions of less
                    than a paragraph in 41 documents.</p>
                <p>The editors are confident, on the basis of the research conducted in preparing
                    this volume and as a result of the declassification review process described
                    above, that this volume is an accurate record of the foreign policy of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administrations toward Southern Africa
                    between 1969 and 1976.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It also requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State historians by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. All the Department’s indexed central files through
                    July 1973 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records
                    Administration at College Park, Maryland (Archives II). Many of the Department’s
                    decentralized office files covering the 1969–1976 period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have also been transferred or are
                    in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives
                    II.</p>

                    and other White House foreign policy records, including tape recordings of

                    Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the

                <p>For the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> period, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project contains
                    several collections from the National Security Council Files that are relevant
                    to research on Southern Africa. The administration conducted a series of policy
                    reviews on Southern Africa, focusing on individual countries and the region as a
                    whole. This collection of National Security Study Memoranda (NSSM), the
                    interagency studies, and the National Security Decision Memoranda (NSDM) are in
                    the NSC Institutional Files (H-Files). These files also contain records of
                    high-level meetings and policy papers. The Country File for Rhodesia focuses
                    primarily on the issue of sanctions on Rhodesian chrome and the <persName
                        corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> amendment. The Country File for the
                    United Kingdom focuses on the U.S.–U.K. strategy for resolving the Rhodesian
                    crisis. The Country File for South Africa contains materials covering the denial
                    of a visa to Arthur Ashe, the U.S.-South African understanding on gold and the
                    proposed nuclear fuel agreement, as well as the assignment of a black Foreign
                    Service Officer to the Embassy. The Presidential Tape Recordings at the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project
                    contain little regarding administration decision making. However, they do
                    provide greater insight into <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s
                    attitudes toward Africans in general and his personal beliefs about Rhodesia and
                    Portuguese Africa.</p>
                <p>The Central Files of the Department of State are a particularly useful collection
                    located at the National Archives. These files contain detailed information from
                    the Department and African posts. The most relevant subject-numeric designations
                    for South Africa’s administration of South West Africa are POL 15–2 SAFR, POL
                    23–5 SAFR, POL 19 SWAFR and POL 29 SWAFR. The most relevant subject-numeric
                    designations for U.S. relations with South Africa are POL SAFR–US, POL 1
                    SAFR–US, POL 17 SAFR–US, POL 23 SAFR, DEF 12 SAFR, DEF 12–5 SAFR, SOC 14 SAFR
                    and PPT Ashe, Arthur. The most relevant subject-numeric designations for
                    Rhodesia are POL UK–US, POL 16 RHOD and FT 11–2 RHOD. For Portuguese Africa, the
                    most relevant subject-numeric designations are POL PORT–US, POL 17 PORT–US and

                    located in the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress. Within this
                    collection, there are several sub-collections which contain detailed memoranda
                    of conversation on this topic. They include: Presidential File, Memoranda of
                    Conversation, and Memoranda of Conversation, Chronological File. National
                    Security Council meetings on Angola are located in NSC Committees and Panels, as

                    Presidential Country Files for Zaire provide documentation of U.S. efforts to

                    support for U.S. efforts to thwart an MPLA victory. The Country Files for
                    Portugal provide details on the situation in Angola and Department efforts to
                    ensure an orderly transition to independence. Memoranda for the record of 40

                    the INR/IL Historical Files at the Department of State. These collections also
                    contain a number of interagency studies and papers on Angola. The Department of
                    State’s State Archiving System (SAS) is a word-searchable database and an
                    excellent source for cable traffic after 1973. Historical documents from this
                    system have been transferred to the National Archives and are part of the online
                    Access to Archival Database (AAD). This is a valuable source for all cables, but
                    is particularly useful for chronicling the effort to establish diplomatic
                    relations with Mozambique and for documenting the Portuguese exit from
                    Angola.</p>

                <p>The Truman administration’s concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted
                    the new National Security Council to authorize, in NSC 4–A of December 1947, the
                    launching of peacetime covert action operations. NSC 4–A made the Director of
                    Central Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the
                    same time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certainly was a natural choice
                    but it was assigned this function at least in part because the Agency controlled
                    unvouchered funds, by which operations could be funded with minimal risk of
                    exposure in Washington.<note n="1">NSC 4–A, December 17, 1947, is printed in

                <p>The CIA’s early use of its new covert action mandate dissatisfied officials at
                    the Departments of State and Defense. The Department of State, believing this
                    role too important to be left to the CIA alone and concerned that the military
                    might create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen
                    the issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside.
                    Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new NSC directive, NSC 10/2, superseded NSC
                    4–A.</p>
                <p>NSC 10/2 directed the CIA to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of
                    friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and executed that any
                    US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and
                    that if un<pb n="XXXII" facs="0033" xml:id="pg_XXXII"/>covered the US Government
                    can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.”</p>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:
                    “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage,
                    demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
                    assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee
                    liberations [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] groups, and support of indigenous
                    anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such
                    operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military forces,
                    espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military
                        operations.”<note n="2">NSC 10/2, June 18, 1948, is printed <ref

                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the CIA on
                    September 1, 1948, in accordance with NSC 10/2, assumed responsibility for
                    organizing and managing covert actions. The OPC, which was to take its guidance
                    from the Department of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime,
                    initially had direct access to the State Department and to the military without
                    having to proceed through the CIA’s administrative hierarchy, provided the
                    Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was informed of all important projects
                    and decisions.<note n="3">Memorandum of conversation by <persName

                    to ensure that policy guidance came to the OPC through the DCI.</p>
                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically
                    prominent of the CIA’s activities. Concerned about this situation, DCI Walter
                    Bedell Smith in early 1951 asked the NSC for enhanced policy guidance and a
                    ruling on the proper “scope and magnitude” of CIA operations. The White House
                    responded with two initiatives. In April 1951 President Truman created the
                    Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under the NSC to coordinate government-wide
                    psychological warfare strategy. NSC 10/5, issued in October 1951, reaffirmed the
                    covert action mandate given in NSC 10/2 and expanded the CIA’s authority over
                    guerrilla warfare.<note n="4">NSC 10/5, “Scope and Pace of Covert Operations,”

                    incoming Eisenhower administration, but the expansion of the CIA’s covert action
                    writ in NSC 10/5 helped ensure that covert action would remain a major function
                    of the Agency.</p>
                <p>As the Truman administration ended, the CIA was near the peak of its independence
                    and authority in the field of covert action. Although the CIA continued to seek
                    and receive advice on specific <pb n="XXXIII" facs="0034" xml:id="pg_XXXIII"
                    />projects from the NSC, the PSB, and the departmental representatives
                    originally delegated to advise the OPC, no group or officer outside of the DCI
                    and the President himself had authority to order, approve, manage, or curtail
                    operations.</p>

                    Committee</p>
                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing the CIA’s latitude in 1954. In
                    accordance with a series of National Security Council directives, the
                    responsibility of the Director of Central Intelligence for the conduct of covert
                    operations was further clarified. President Eisenhower approved NSC 5412 on
                    March 15, 1954, reaffirming the Central Intelligence Agency’s responsibility for
                    conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth;
                    the DCI was made responsible for coordinating with designated representatives of
                    the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that covert
                    operations were planned and conducted in a manner consistent with U.S. foreign
                    and military policies; and the Operations Coordinating Board was designated the
                    normal channel for coordinating support for covert operations among State,
                    Defense, and the CIA. Representatives of the Secretary of State, the Secretary
                    of Defense, and the President were to be advised in advance of major covert
                    action programs initiated by the CIA under this policy and were to give policy
                    approval for such programs and secure coordination of support among the
                    Departments of State and Defense and the CIA.<note n="5">William M. Leary,

                <p>A year later, on March 12, 1955, NSC 5412/1 was issued, identical to NSC 5412
                    except for designating the Planning Coordination Group as the body responsible
                    for coordinating covert operations. NSC 5412/2 of December 28, 1955, assigned to
                    representatives (of the rank of assistant secretary) of the Secretary of State,
                    the Secretary of Defense, and the President responsibility for coordinating
                    covert actions. By the end of the Eisenhower administration, this group, which
                    became known as the “NSC 5412/2 Special Group” or simply “Special Group,”
                    emerged as the executive body to review and approve covert action programs

                <p>After the Bay of Pigs failure in April 1961, General Maxwell Taylor reviewed U.S.
                    paramilitary capabilities at President Kennedy’s request and submitted a report
                    in June that recommended strengthening high-level direction of covert
                    operations. As a result of the Taylor Report, the Special Group, chaired by the
                    President’s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy, and
                    including Deputy Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">U. Alexis

                    of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                    General Lyman Lemnitzer, assumed greater responsibility for planning and
                    reviewing covert operations. Until 1963 the DCI determined whether a
                    CIA-originated project was submitted to the Special Group. In 1963 the Special
                    Group developed general but informal criteria, including risk, possibility of
                    success, potential for exposure, political sensitivity, and cost (a threshold of
                    $25,000 was adopted by the CIA), for determining whether covert action projects
                    were submitted to the Special Group.<note n="8">Ibid., p. 82.</note></p>
                <p>From November 1961 to October 1962 a Special Group (Augmented), whose membership
                    was the same as the Special Group plus Attorney General Robert Kennedy and
                    General Taylor (as Chairman), exercised responsibility for Operation Mongoose, a
                    major covert action program aimed at overthrowing the Castro regime in Cuba.
                    When President Kennedy authorized the program in November, he designated
                    Brigadier General Edward G. Lansdale, Assistant for Special Operations to the
                    Secretary of Defense, to act as chief of operations, and Lansdale coordinated
                    the Mongoose activities among the CIA and the Departments of State and Defense.
                    The CIA units in Washington and Miami had primary responsibility for
                    implementing Mongoose operations, which included military, sabotage, and
                    political propaganda programs.<note n="9">See <ref target="frus1961-63v10#d270"

                <p>The Special Group and the 303 Committee approved 163 covert actions during the
                    Kennedy administration and 142 during the Johnson administration through
                    February 1967. The 1976 Final Report of the Church Committee, however, estimated
                    that of the several thousand projects undertaken by the CIA since 1961, only 14
                    percent were considered on a case-by-case basis by the 303 Committee and its
                    predecessors (and successors). Those not reviewed by the 303 Committee were
                    low-risk and low-cost operations. The Final Report also cited a February 1967
                    CIA memorandum that included a description of the mode of policy arbitration of
                    decisions on covert actions within the 303 Committee system. The CIA
                    presentations were questioned, amended, and even on occasion denied, despite
                    protests from the DCI. Department of State objections modified or nullified
                    proposed operations, and the 303 Committee sometimes decided that some agency
                    other than the CIA should undertake an operation or that CIA actions requested
                    by Ambassadors on the scene should be rejected.<note n="12"><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The effectiveness of covert action has always been difficult for any
                    administration to gauge, given concerns about security and the difficulty of
                    judging the impact of U.S. initiatives on events. In October 1969 the new
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> administration required annual
                    303 Committee reviews for all covert actions that the Committee had approved and
                    automatic termination of any operation not reviewed after 12 months. On February
                    17, 1970, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> signed

                    media. The Attorney General was also added to the membership of the Committee.
                        <pb n="XXXVI" facs="0037" xml:id="pg_XXXVI"/>NSDM 40 reaffirmed the DCI’s
                    responsibility for the coordination, control, and conduct of covert operations
                    and directed him to obtain policy approval from the 40 Committee for all major
                    and “politically sensitive” covert operations. He was also made responsible for
                    ensuring an annual review by the 40 Committee of all approved covert
                    operations.</p>
                <p>The 40 Committee met regularly early in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration, but over time the number of formal
                    meetings declined and business came to be conducted via couriers and telephone
                    votes. The Committee actually met only for major new proposals. As required, the
                    DCI submitted annual status reports to the 40 Committee for each approved
                    operation. According to the 1976 Church Committee Final Report, the 40 Committee
                    considered only about 25 percent of the CIA’s individual covert action projects,
                    concentrating on major projects that provided broad policy guidelines for all
                    covert actions. Congress received briefings on only a few proposed projects. Not
                    all major operations, moreover, were brought before the 40 Committee: President
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> in 1970 instructed the DCI to
                    promote a coup d’ etat against Chilean President Salvador Allende without

                            reduce it to the status of another province of South Africa.</p>

                            “homelands.” Six such homelands already set apart on paper will lack
                            sufficient population or resources to become viable states. The tribal
                            groups immediately affected are: the Ovambo, 270,000; the Damara,
                            50,000; the Herero, 40,000; the Okavango, 30,000; the East Caprivians,

                            white farm land at a much faster rate than was taking place inside the

                            viability, took the first step towards homeland status in October 1968,

                            Africa’s administrative machinery, hitherto operated with some degree of
                            autonomy. The list of bureau functions transferred is long and
                            impressive: services dealing with labor, African education, interior,
                            prisons, commerce, industries, justice, colored affairs, mines, public
                            works, posts and telegraphs, transport, social welfare, water affairs,
                            and agriculture. The bill also makes any and all South African laws
                            applicable to South West Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Local Reactions: Whites</hi>. Most whites in South West
                            Africa accept apartheid and go along with the 1962 Odendaal Plan, which
                            provided the guidelines for Pretoria’s incorporation of the territory.
                            The South Africans have reassured them that taxes will not be raised in
                            South West Africa and that the German language will retain its special
                            status. Another concession was to abolish a split tariff that had
                            increased the price of goods imported into South West Africa from South
                            Africa. Little opposition will come from white political leaders since a
                            wing of South Africa’s ruling National Party controls all the South West
                            African seats in South Africa’s Parliament as well as all the seats in
                            South West’s Provincial Council. Even those whites in South West noted
                            for their independent streak resigned themselves long ago to being ruled
                            from Pretoria, because they are not about to allow themselves to be
                            governed by any <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> committee, let alone
                            some future combination of local non-whites.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Local Reactions: Africans</hi>. For black South West
                            Africans the proposed new administrative arrangements probably will not
                            mean much of a change in their daily lives. Neither in this case nor in
                            that of the Homelands Act—which has affected where and how individuals
                            live—has there been much chance for Africans to react without getting
                            into serious trouble. Theoretically, the introduction of legislative
                            councils will provide greater opportunities for political expression and
                            self-government, but it is doubtful that this will be true in practice.
                            The chiefs will be the dominant figures in the new councils, and they
                            will tend to do what the authorities tell them to do. Furthermore, since
                            non-white political movements have been effectively suppressed in South
                            West Africa, it is hard to see politics freely developing in the
                            homelands. South West African exile groups and African members of the

                            constitutional proposals come close to eliminating any remaining

                            They break abruptly with the suggestions for a <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>-Rhodesian agreement that emerged from the meeting in
                            October 1968 between Smith and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson on
                            board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Fearless</hi>. At the outset, the new
                            constitution would halve the present number of directly elected African
                            representatives in the Rhodesian parliament. It would establish avowedly
                            racial voting rolls and drop even the pretense of a non-racial electoral
                            system maintained under the present constitution. Finally, the proposals
                            explicitly discard the idea that Africans could ever work their passage
                            to majority rule. The far-distant goal of the new document is at most
                            political parity of Africans and Europeans. Al<pb n="5" facs="0044"

                            already attacked the proposals as inadequate.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Mechanics</hi>. Regional congresses of the
                            Rhodesian Front have approved the proposals. The next step is a
                            referendum, which could be held as early as May. The timetable may slip,
                            however.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Proposals in Outline</hi>. Since the full text is
                            not yet published (or even drafted, according to some reports) a number
                            of important details are lacking. But in general they will probably
                            provide for:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">a national assembly</hi> consisting initially of 66
                            members. Of these, 50 would be elected by a voters’ roll consisting of
                            Europeans, Asians, and Coloreds. The remaining 16 would be Africans—8
                            directly elected by an African voters’ roll, 8 indirectly chosen by an
                            electoral college composed of chiefs, headmen, and councilors.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">an African membership</hi> that could be expanded
                            to ultimate parity with the Europeans (i.e., 50 seats) as the African
                            population’s income tax payments increase. (According to one recent
                            estimate, Africans currently pay one half of one per cent of the total
                            personal income tax collected in Rhodesia.) The increase in African
                            seats is to be four at a time, to maintain parity between the two
                            largest tribal groups, the Matabele and Mashona.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">a senate</hi> (10 Europeans chosen by the assembly,
                            10 chiefs, and 3 appointed members) that would exercise delaying powers
                            with respect to legislation considered unfair to any racial group.</p>
                        <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">three provincial assemblies</hi>—two African, one
                            European—to which Parliament could delegate powers.</p>

                                Motives</hi>. As he did in mid-1968, when the debate over a new
                            constitution erupted within the Rhodesian Front, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> has moved to check his right
                            wing critics by prompting [<hi rend="italic">preempting</hi>] most of
                            their positions. But in the process he seems to be burning his last
                            bridges to the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>. He may be signalling
                            to London that if there is to be another round of negotiations, it must
                            come quickly. But in that case he will have to be prepared to discard
                            the present proposals or modify them drastically, because there is
                            little if anything in them that Wilson could square with his “Six
                            Principles” for a Rhodesian settlement.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">The
                                “five principles” served as the basis for confidential talks between
                                the British and Rhodesian Governments from November 1970 onwards.
                                First enunciated in October 1965, a sixth principle was added in
                                January 1966 after <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName>’s unilateral declaration of independence. The sixth
                                principle, which ensured there would be “no oppression of the
                                majority by the minority or of the minority by the majority” was not
                                included in the November 1970 negotiations. (<hi rend="italic"

                            from merits of case, bill had gone through two readings and was now

                        <p>This is not an immediate crisis. Though some would argue that the black
                            terrorist raids into Rhodesia and the white reprisals are the first
                            rounds of the long-predicted race war, that violence remains minor. The
                            white-ruled regimes should contain any military threat for 3–5 years
                            easily. But the black-white confrontation in Southern Africa will be
                            with us with growing insistence politically throughout the ’70s.</p>
                        <p>There are three principal reasons why I think we should get an early
                            Presidential grip on this subject:</p>
                        <p>(1) There has been no full, high-level review of U.S. interests and
                            objectives in Southern Africa since the early <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRT_1">Kennedy</persName> years. Yet the situation in
                            the area has become more volatile and complicated in the last few years,
                            including the presence of the Soviets and Chinese as patrons of the
                            terrorist groups operating against Rhodesia and the Portuguese
                            Territories of Angola and Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>(2) The United States has meaningful yet potentially conflicting
                            interests in the area which should be clearly identified and weighed. We
                            have a political stake in dissociation from the repressive racial
                            policies of the white regimes. At the same time, we have important
                            material interests—a <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> tracking
                            station, overflight and refueling rights, <pb n="8" facs="0047"
                                xml:id="pg_8"/>heavy U.S. investment, and a major trade
                            potential—which require some involvement with the white authorities.
                            These interests are sometimes at odds in fact, and sometimes because
                            others—in Africa or here at home—regard them so. A recent example was
                            the call of the Carrier <hi rend="italic">FDR</hi> at Capetown, which
                            was suddenly cancelled by the Johnson Administration after a major furor
                            by U.S. civil rights groups.</p>
                        <p>(3) Finally, the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> should have the
                            arguments on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the options open to U.S. policy
                            in dealing with the white regimes. I think Dean Acheson had a point in
                            his recent conversation with you that State has been tied rather
                            stubbornly to one track on this aspect of the problem. There is clearly
                            a legitimate case for a quite different policy than the current posture
                            toward the white regimes.</p>
                        <p>If you approve, we can schedule a <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>

                        <p>This is the first I have heard of this process. The major U.S. chrome
                            companies in Rhodesia—Union Carbide and Foote Mineral—are always
                            lobbying hard to obtain relief from sanctions. And <gloss

                            <persName corresp="#p_BP_1">Buchanan</persName>’s memo is clearly an
                            end-run around the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> channel. The
                            problem is that there are several issues here in honest dispute within
                            the Government, and the President should certainly see all sides of the
                            question before making a final decision. Here is a brief run-down:</p>
                        <p>1. The first <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                            Resolution on mandatory Rhodesian sanctions in December 1966—which the
                            U.S. implemented by Presidential Executive Order still in
                            force—specifically prohibits <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members
                            from importing chrome from Rhodesia.<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5"
                                >Resolution 232, adopted December 16, 1966, prohibited the
                                importation of chrome and other products from Rhodesia. (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Yearbook of the United Nations, 1966</hi>, pp.
                                116–117) Executive Order 11322 was signed on January 5,
                            1967.</note></p>
                        <p>2. There was provision accompanying our Executive Order to issue licenses
                            for chrome imports from Rhodesia in certain “hardship cases.” This was
                            generally interpreted to cover imports of chrome which had <hi
                                rend="italic">left</hi> Rhodesia prior to the adoption of the
                            Security Council Resolution but were still in transit after its
                            adoption.</p>
                        <p>3. Union Carbide and Foote Mineral are now asking for an import license
                            for some 200,000 tons of chrome which had <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            left Rhodesia prior to December 1966. <persName corresp="#p_BP_1"
                                >Buchanan</persName> argues that both companies should be given the
                            licenses because they <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> for this ore prior to
                            the sanctions.</p>
                        <p>In fact, Foote’s 57,000 tons of this total was not even mined until
                            1967–68—and even then with money which was licensed by the U.S. on the
                            clear understanding that (a) the mining would only serve to keep the
                            Foote mine operating as a salvageable U.S. property in Rhodesia, and (b)
                            none of the ore so mined would be licensed for import to the U.S. in
                            violation of the sanctions. Union Carbide’s 150,000 tons was paid for
                                <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Security Council Resolution, yet
                            just <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the formal U.S. Executive Order.
                            Thus, in both cases the legal point here about when the ore was paid for
                            is by no means clear cut.</p>
                        <p>4. The merits of the chrome sanctions—as for all sanctions—are certainly
                            arguable. Honest men will disagree about the general impact of sanctions
                            on the <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> regime, the
                            hardship to U.S. industry, the market benefits to other chrome suppliers
                            like the Soviet Union, etc. All these points bear on the license for
                            this deal.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BP_1">Buchanan</persName> argues, for example,
                            that the sanctions have brought “serious pressures” on the domestic
                            chrome industry. Yet there is a 1- to 2-year supply of chrome presently
                            available in the U.S. There are significant quantities of chrome
                            purchased from our stockpile but still unused by the purchaser. And
                            chrome ore is available on the world market, albeit at higher
                            prices.</p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="0052" xml:id="pg_13"/>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BP_1">Buchanan</persName> argues that importing
                            this chrome will actually hurt the Rhodesians by depriving them of a
                            valuable asset which they might sell on the black market. The fact is
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> has not been able
                            to sell all the chrome he’s got, let alone these 200,000 U.S. tons. Most
                            important, however, neither the Rhodesians, nor the Africans, nor our
                            own Congress would see this as a simple economic deal. Sanctions are
                            nothing if not a political instrument. <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName> and his supporters will jump on this licensing and
                            play it for all it’s worth as a softening of U.S. pressure, a lessening
                            of our support for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and a signal
                            to other countries to throw in the towel. The President may wish to do
                            that, but that is a decision that has to be taken after the most careful
                            review of all the consequences and in the framework of our general
                            policy objectives in Southern Africa. This is not only an economic
                            benefit to U.S. firms, but a clear political windfall for Rhodesia. We
                            could reasonably extract some quid for the chromium quo.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_BP_1">Buchanan</persName> says a license would
                            win us some friends in the business community and encounter only
                            “short-lived . . . flak from the Left.” I must say this seems to me the
                            most dubious proposition of all, when Senator Kennedy<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d8fn6">Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D–MA).</note> et al. are
                            looking for every chance to embarrass the Administration on racially
                            loaded issues such as Southern Africa. As for our business friends,
                            other users and importers of chrome might well frown on a deal which
                            gave Foote and Union Carbide special access to captive chrome supplies.
                            Then too, we can expect the nickel, asbestos and lithium people to seek
                            similar relief. The door would be open on sanctions, or we would indeed

                        <p>Again, a case can be made for the President taking that heat as the cost
                            of a conscious policy calculated to be in the national interest. But
                            that only argues further for the most rigorous and comprehensive look at

                            the President’s relationship with Harold Wilson demands that we look at
                            Rhodesian chrome as a decidedly political commodity.</p>

                            toward Southern Africa. (I have taken the liberty of marking important
                            passages in the document).</p>
                        <p>The black Africans are never at a loss to condemn minority rule in the
                            white regimes or to criticize the West for its failure to take tougher
                                <pb n="15" facs="0054" xml:id="pg_15"/>action on the problem. But
                            this latest statement is notably more moderate than those of the past.
                            Some of its main points:</p>
                        <p>(1) The “liberation” of Southern Africa does not mean racialism in
                            reverse. All people now living in the area are judged to be “Africans”
                            regardless of skin color.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Portuguese hold on Mozambique and Angola was criticized not for
                            racialism, but for “the pretense that Portugal exists in Africa.” If the
                            Portuguese would accept the principle of self-determination, the African
                            states would try to get the guerrilla movements in the territories to
                            put down their arms and work for a peaceful transfer of power. White
                            settlers would be welcomed by new black governments, however, with the
                            hope that a “liberated” Angola and Mozambique would simply become
                            African versions of Brazil.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">But</hi></p>
                        <p>(a) the British should “re-assert” their authority in Rhodesia to bring
                            about majority rule (just how this is to be done the statement doesn’t
                            make clear);</p>
                        <p>(b) the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> should enable Southwest Africa
                            to exercise self-determination (again the means are not specified);
                            and</p>
                        <p>(c) South Africa should be kicked out of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> and generally ostracized by the world community.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We should not read too much into the manifesto. The hard political
                            realities of the area remain: (1) for reasons of domestic politics and
                            racial pride, African leaders will not abandon their basic opposition to
                            white minority rule, yet (2) they can’t reach their objective in
                            Southern Africa without outside—and especially U.S.—support. The
                            long-run problem here for black Africa is how to reconcile their passion
                            with that dependence.</p>
                        <p>We certainly cannot deduce the ultimate thrust of black policy from this
                            manifesto. But it is interesting for its departures from the standard
                            rhetoric. For the moment at least, the Africans may have found tactical
                            reasons for trying a milder approach in talking about their problem.</p>

                        <p>A South African law, soon to take effect, further strengthens the secret
                            police at the expense of an open society. While there is no visible
                            threat to white domination, the government continues to extend its
                            repressive legislation.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Latest Club</hi>. Under South Africa’s weird blend
                            of parliamentary democracy and totalitarianism, the government has once
                            more passed another bill to further limit civil rights. A recently
                            enacted law makes legally unanswerable to the courts the Bureau for
                            State Security, a combined police and intelligence agency. In essence,
                            the new legislation forbids disclosure of any information concerning
                                <gloss target="#t_BOSS_1">BOSS</gloss> (an acronym bestowed by the
                            English-language press), even in judicial proceedings, without the
                            government’s authorization. The government, for example, can prevent
                            accused persons from testifying even in their own defense, if it wants
                            to suppress their evidence. The law is vague enough to encompass most
                            public discussion of police activities and may silence future criticism
                            in this area.</p>

                            electrocuted during police interrogation. An on-going trial of a liberal

                        <p><hi rend="italic">No Signs of Loosening Up</hi>. In spite of a booming
                            economy and an ever increasing standard of living for whites (and for
                            some non-whites too), a growing trade with black Africa, and a desire to

                        <p>1. Maintaining the Consulate is not recognition of the regime.</p>
                        <p>2. To end all relations with Rhodesia is contrary to our national
                            interests, since the effect of sanctions against Rhodesia—now that the
                            regime has adopted a constitution which precludes black African majority
                            rule—is to foment race war there.</p>

                            (A) Foreign Ministry had, following press reports concerning alleged
                            visa denial, made inquiries of <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss>
                            Embassy Wash<pb n="19" facs="0058" xml:id="pg_19"/>ington and <gloss

                            that no visa application had been received from Ashe; (B) if Ashe should
                            apply for visa, application would be considered on merits as any other
                            application.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> commented in personal
                            vein that hundreds of visas issued annually for non-whites, and fact
                            Ashe is Negro would not be cause of rejection of application. He cited
                            cases several American Negroes who had visited South Africa in recent
                            past and again stated that question concerning conditions of Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName>’ visa were not repeat
                            not related to his race but were associated with his committee work.</p>
                        <p>3. I asked whether, if Ashe applied for visa and was granted same, he
                            would be permitted to play tennis with white South Africans. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> said this was matter within

                            question. All he could say was that circumstances of visa application
                            would be considered. If purpose was deemed to be to “show up South
                            Africa”, i.e. to come to country for political purposes, this no doubt
                            would be taken into account.</p>

                            concern of the US Government to <pb n="20" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_20"
                            />the Government of South Africa. He then gave the Ambassador Aides
                            Mémoire concerning visa applications of Congressmen <persName

                            application of repressive legislation to South West Africa.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d13fn2">See <ref target="#d14">Document 14</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Regarding the visa matter, the Secretary emphasized the importance of the
                            Congressional role in the U.S., mentioned a meeting with Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> not long ago regarding
                            U.S. policy towards southern Africa, and observed that determination of
                            our policy toward South Africa is apt to be affected by the fact that
                            the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Africa has been excluded from
                            South Africa. The action of South Africa, Communist China, or other
                            countries in walling off their states, particularly to keep out
                            responsible elected officials, is inevitably regarded with suspicion
                            abroad. The Secretary pointed out that Congressional trips are a
                            necessary part of foreign policy formulation and although some
                            Congressmen have critical views on South Africa, they are not
                            irresponsible, and on balance it is wiser to permit an exchange of
                            ideas, which should contribute to better understanding.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> said he had
                            already told Congressman <persName corresp="#p_ROR_1">Reid</persName> he
                            would be welcome to come and look around in South Africa. But this is
                            not the object of his visit; he wants to speak at universities and
                            participate in agitational student groups. It is hard to think this
                            purpose does not constitute interference in domestic South African
                            affairs. The Congressman is clearly going to stir up trouble and engage
                            in anti-South African activity. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_ROR_1"
                                >Reid</persName>’s press release expressed his objections to
                            apartheid and his support for human rights and the rule of law; his
                            implication was untrue that the South Africans are not interested in
                            human rights and the rule of law.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed there is a wide gulf between Congressman <persName
                                corresp="#p_ROR_1">Reid</persName>’s intentions and interference in
                            South African affairs. An elected U.S. official should be able to go to
                            talk with people in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> responded
                            that Congressman <persName corresp="#p_ROR_1">Reid</persName> is not
                            being excluded because of his views but on the basis that he would be
                            going to make trouble, as can be seen from the attitudes and activities
                            of the student group (<gloss target="#t_NUSAS_1">NUSAS</gloss>) that
                            invited him. <persName corresp="#p_ROR_1">Reid</persName> is an elected
                            official in the U.S. but not in South Africa, and he is not the first
                            elected official to be excluded from a foreign country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> said Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> was also welcome to
                            visit South Africa, but under the restriction that he not engage in
                            activities or make statements that would constitute interference in
                            internal affairs nor address any public meetings. <persName
                                corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> said these were very
                            reasonable re<pb n="21" facs="0060" xml:id="pg_21"/>strictions and
                            asked whether the Secretary would say such visitors <hi rend="italic"
                                >should</hi> interfere in South Africa’s affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there is no question about the right of a sovereign
                            country to control admission of foreigners, but the present case
                            represents an unhappy state of affairs that could affect our relations.
                            It is one thing to tell a Congressman to leave if he misbehaves, but
                            something else to restrict his coming on the assumption that he intends
                            interference, even though there is no clear indication of what form that
                            might take.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> opined it
                            would be worse to expel misbehaving Congressmen than to restrict their
                            admission. He concluded with the observation that South Africa would
                            like more Congressmen to visit, but was not prepared to allow them to
                            interfere in internal matters; the South African members of Parliament
                            who visited the U.S. recently did not meddle in American affairs.</p>
                        <p>An impasse having been reached, the Secretary then turned the
                            conversation to the application of Clauses 10 and 29 of the 1969 General
                            Law Amendment Act to South West Africa.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3"
                                >Clause 10 broadly defined a security matter as anything relating to
                                the security of the Republic and imposed stiff penalties for
                                violations. Clause 29 hampered the defense of the accused by
                                preventing evidence that might be “prejudicial to the interest of
                                the public or State security” from being introduced into court. (<hi

                            the international status of the Territory. We consider the General Law
                            Amendment Law lacks legal basis, as the U.N. has responsibility for
                            South West Africa. Moreover, Articles 10 and 29 are arbitrary and
                            restrictive, violate the rights of the inhabitants, and are incompatible
                            with the Rule of Law. The U.S. therefore urges the South African
                            Government not to apply the law to South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> said South
                            Africa disputes the claim of U.N. responsibility for South West Africa.
                            South Africa administers the Territory in the spirit of the Mandate,
                            Article 2 of which states South Africa can apply its laws to South West
                            Africa. There may be things in the General Law Amendment Act the U.S.
                            does not like, but South Africa considers the law necessary because of
                            terrorism and people on its borders stirring up trouble and harboring
                            terrorists. <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> assured the
                            Secretary the terms of the law would be applied with restraint and would
                            not harm South West Africa. There has been much progress in the
                            Territory, South Africa has done a good job and it plans to continue on
                            these lines.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to five outstanding unanswered U.S. communications
                            on this general subject and reaffirmed them and our oral representations
                            regarding the South West Africa Affairs Act and the <pb n="22"

                            communications as a contribution to a constructive exchange of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> said the South Africans
                            would be happy to have a constructive exchange and had long wanted the
                            U.S. Ambassador to go to South West Africa to look around and talk with
                            the people.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the international status of South West Africa could be
                            discussed without going to the Territory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> agreed but reiterated
                            the desire to have the Ambassador go to South West Africa. He said some
                            people term South West Africa a threat to international peace and
                            security; how about Nigeria, where they say 1.7 million have been
                            killed—three times the population of South West Africa? If South Africa
                            followed the advice to administer South West Africa as a single entity,
                            the small war-like Heroro group would fight the Ovambos, who are 45% of
                            the population, and enslave them. The Ambassador cited the loss of life
                            in the Sudan; there is no concern or complaint in the U.N. about
                            that.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated it is the international character of South West
                            Africa and specific U.N. responsibility for the Territory that make the
                            situation different there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> responded that South
                            Africa does not recognize such a U.N. responsibility. He added that with
                            no criticism of the U.S. role in Vietnam, the number of people killed
                            there exceeds the population of South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we prefer to avoid such situations. Where we see one
                            on the horizon, we try to prevent trouble, as we have recently in
                            Central America. We are pleased at our contribution in that area and
                            would like to make a contribution in South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> said again:
                            Send your Ambassador to South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>Another impasse having been reached, the meeting was ended after 55
                            minutes.</p>

                        <p>Qte: The Government of the United States has noted the passage by the
                            South African Parliament of the General Law Amendment Act of 1969 and,
                            in particular, notes that clauses 10 and 29 of this Act apply to the
                            international territory of <gloss target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss>.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">See <ref target="#d13fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    13</ref>.</note> Such application lacks proper legal basis,
                            since <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> has forfeited its right to
                            administer the territory, for which direct responsibility rests in the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p>It is a matter of additional concern to the Government of the United
                            States that the clauses in question are of such nature as to contravene
                            important rights of the inhabitants. Such rights continue to demand
                            respect and could not have been divested or diminished by reason of
                            South Africa’s forfeiture of its own rights in the territory. The
                            Government of the United States is particularly concerned that clause
                            10, which amends the Official Secrets Act and is applicable to South
                            West Africa, makes unlawful the communication or publication “in any
                            manner or for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the
                            Republic” of any information relating to any “security matter.” Security
                            matter is very broadly defined as “any matter relating to the security
                            of the Republic.” It specifically includes “any matter dealt with by or
                            relating to the relationship subsisting between any person and the said
                            Bureau.” By its very generality clause 10 is suppressive of freedom of
                            information in and concerning South West Africa, which is essential to
                            the development of free institutions and to the well-being and
                            self-government of the inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>Clause 29 prevents the introduction before any court or “any body or
                            institution established by or under any law” of any evidence or in<pb
                                n="24" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_24"/>formation in matters where the
                            Prime Minister, any functionary authorized by him, or any other
                            Minister, certifies a claim of executive privilege on the basis of state
                            or public security. It necessarily follows that any person involved in
                            an administrative, or possibly even a legislative proceeding, or
                            litigating a civil matter in court, as well as any accused in a criminal
                            proceeding, will be barred, upon the requisite unreviewable
                            certification, from presenting information which could be essential to a
                            fair outcome or adjudication. Clause 29 is thus in derogation of the
                            rule of law and injurious to the well-being of the inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>Without addressing itself to the question of the implications of clauses
                            10 and 29 for South Africa’s obligations in respect to matters other
                            than South West Africa, the Government of the United States wishes to
                            make clear that it considers their enactment contrary to South Africa’s
                            international obligations with regard to South West Africa and in
                            contravention of the rights vested in the inhabitants by the Covenant of
                            the League of Nations, the Mandate Agreement and the Charter of the
                            United Nations. Moreover, extension to South West Africa of South
                            African legislation so arbitrary and restrictive in nature cannot fail
                            further to arouse international tensions to the prejudice of friendly
                            and cooperative relationships.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States therefore urges the South African
                            Government to take account of the implications of this legislation and
                            reconsider and withdraw its application to the international territory
                            of South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>Certain earlier communications from the Government of the United States
                            to the Government of South Africa concerning legislation made applicable
                            to the international territory of South West Africa conveyed views and
                            put questions in the hope that they might be productive both of dialogue
                            and developments consistent with the interests of the inhabitants of
                            that territory. A list of such communications is attached.</p>
                        <p>On the present occasion the Government of the United States wishes to
                            reiterate the concerns expressed in these communications and in its
                            recent oral representations concerning the South West Africa Affairs Act
                            of 1969, as well as concerning the continuing application to South West
                            Africa of the Terrorism Act of 1967, as evidenced by the current trial
                            at Windhoek and detentions of South West Africans under that Act.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States hopes that an early response by the
                            Government of South Africa to its past and present observations,
                            inquiries and requests may help to advance a constructive exchange of
                            views on the international territory of South West Africa.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Afro-Asian Tenacity</hi>. In their long-fought battle
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> against the white minority
                            regimes of southern Africa, the Afro-Asians have had mandatory sanctions
                            against South Africa as their long-term goal. They failed, most recently
                            in June, to get a Rhodesian resolution (that would have extended
                            Rhodesian sanctions to South Africa and Mozambique) through the Security
                            Council. They succeeded the next month in having the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> condemn Portugal over frontier incidents
                            with Zambia. The resolution on South-West Africa of August 12
                            illustrates how Afro-Asian support in the Security Council on this issue
                            has now broadened to the point where there were no negative votes and
                            the only abstentions were the US, <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>,
                            France, and Finland.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">What Type of Sanctions</hi>? The resolution provides
                            that if Pretoria does not comply with the demand for withdrawal, the
                            “Security Council will meet immediately to determine upon effective
                            measures.” For the Afro-Asians, “effective measures” mean Chapter VII
                            actions, although it is not clear yet whether the Afro-Asians are
                            prepared to scale or slow down their demands in order to obtain US
                            support. But whatever the tactics, the August 12 resolution has brought
                            the Security Council measurably closer to the point where it will have
                            to decide one way or the other on mandatory sanctions.</p>

                            the World Court decision of 1966. It has virtually annexed the
                                territory<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">See Intelligence Note 81,
                                “South-West Africa: Shrunken Autonomy,” February 11, 1969. [Footnote

                            military units there. Only concerted measures by the major world powers
                            might shake South Africa’s hold over the area, but prospects for such
                            international action seem dimmer than ever.</p>

                            are important trading partners and, more significantly, British

                            all foreign investment in South Africa. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>, therefore, would probably try to dilute any future

                            between African states and the West, and the Afro-Asians are likely to
                            bring new pressures on the US to “do something” about South Africa’s
                            continued presence in the territory.</p>

                            Assembly on September 22, the British Foreign Secretary noted that the
                            section of the speech dealing with Rhodesia had attracted the most
                            attention in the British press. <persName corresp="#p_SRMM_1"
                                >Stewart</persName> said that while he was grateful for past
                            American support of the British position on Rhodesia, he hoped we would
                            not continue to maintain our “diplomatic mission” at Salisbury. Our
                            having official representation there only gave impetus to Rhodesian
                            hopes for “creeping recognition” from the Western countries which kept
                            representatives stationed in Rhodesia. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1"

                            said that the U.S. was aware both of the British viewpoint on this
                            matter and of the drawbacks involved in our maintaining a Consulate <pb

                                many of the points in Resolution 253 (1968), called for mandatory

                        <p>Our policy positions on southern African issues affect a range of U.S.
                            interests. None of the interests are vital to our security, but they
                            have political and material importance. Some of these interests are
                            concrete and evident in the region itself, while others relate to our
                            position in black Africa and the world. The interests can be summarized
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Political</p>
                        <p>Racial repression by white minority regimes in southern Africa has
                            international political ramifications extending beyond the region
                            itself. Politically conscious blacks elsewhere in Africa and the world
                            deeply resent the continuation of discrimination, identify with the
                            repressed majorities in southern Africa and tend in varying degrees to
                            see relationships of outside powers with the white regimes as at least
                            tacit acceptance of racism. Many others in the non-white world tend to
                            share this view in some measure. The communist states have been quick to
                            seize on this issue and to support black aspirations. Thus our policy
                            toward the white regimes of southern Africa affects, though it may not
                            necessarily govern, our standing with African and other states on issues
                            in the United Nations and bilaterally. Depending on its intensity,
                            adverse reaction to our policy in southern Africa could make more
                            difficult our relationships elsewhere in Africa on a variety of matters
                            including U.S. defense installations, over-flight rights and the use of
                            port facilities. The same consideration applies to economic relations:
                            direct investment in Africa outside the white regime states currently
                            totals <pb n="30" facs="0069" xml:id="pg_30"/>about $1.5 billion (of
                            which the greater part is in black Africa south of the Sahara), or about
                            two-thirds of the total U.S. investment in Africa. U.S. exports split
                            about 60% to the black states of Africa and 40% to the white regime
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Because of the multi-racial character of our society and our own racial
                            problems, other countries tend to see our relationships with southern
                            Africa as reflections of domestic attitudes on race. This situation is
                            exacerbated by the extension of South African racial discrimination to
                            black Americans who may be refused visas or who are subjected to
                            segregated facilities in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>If violence in the area escalates, U.S. interests will be increasingly
                            threatened. In these circumstances the U.S. would find it increasingly
                            difficult without sacrificing interests to find a middle ground in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> on questions of insurgent
                            violence and counter-violence in the region and to resist demands for
                            more positive actions against the white regimes.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Economic</p>
                        <p>U.S. direct investment in southern Africa, mainly in South Africa, is
                            about $1 billion and yields a highly profitable return. Trade, again
                            mainly with South Africa, runs a favorable balance to the U.S. (Our
                            exports to South Africa were about $450 million in 1968 against imports
                            of $250 million.) In addition the U.S. has indirect economic interest in
                            the key role which South Africa plays in the U.K. balance of payments.
                            U.K. investment in South Africa is currently estimated at $3 billion,
                            and the British have made it clear that they will take no action which
                            would jeopardize their economic interests. South Africa produces over
                            75% of the free world supply of gold. The long-term importance of South
                            African gold sales has been reduced by the creation of <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> Special Drawing Rights but they are
                            nonetheless significant in the international monetary system and very
                            important to South Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Defense</p>
                        <p>Southern Africa is geographically important for the U.S. and its allies,
                            particularly with the closing of the Suez Canal and the increased Soviet
                            activity in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. uses overflight and landing facilities for military aircraft in
                            the Portuguese Territories and South Africa. Any of a number of
                            contingencies could require U.S. military air transit to the Indian
                            Ocean/Mid East areas. All but one feasible air route across Africa south
                            of the Sahara would depend upon overflight and, in some cases, landing
                            rights in South Africa or Zambia and Mozambique. The <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> has proposed periodic use of these
                            routes in normal times. However, apart from tracking station support
                            aircraft, the policy has been to request clearance for South Africa as
                            infrequently as possible.</p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="0070" xml:id="pg_31"/>
                        <p>There are major ship repair and logistic facilities in South Africa with
                            a level of technical competence which cannot be duplicated elsewhere on
                            the African continent. We have not permitted U.S. naval vessels to use
                            South African port facilities since early 1967, except for emergencies.
                            We have made use of U.S. Navy or foreign oilers to refuel carriers
                            transiting to and from S.E. Asia via the Cape of Good Hope. Navy force
                            reductions now call for the deactivation of two Atlantic Fleet and one
                            Pacific Fleet oiler, which will attenuate already meager oiler assets so
                            that, the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> considers, assignment of
                            oiler support to a carrier transit would seriously degrade our fleet
                            posture vis-à-vis commitments and requirements. Regular use is made of
                            ports in Angola and Mozambique, however, but these ports cannot
                            accommodate aircraft carriers.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> has a missile tracking station
                            in South Africa under a classified agreement, and some of the military
                            aircraft traffic involves support of this station. The future need for
                            the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> station is under review. The
                            tentative conclusions are that the station is no longer required for
                            research and development of missiles. We also finance a U.K. atmosphere
                            testing station for nuclear materials located in Swaziland which helps
                            us monitor nuclear atmospheric explosions worldwide.</p>

                            uranium oxide which would have the effect of increasing the number of
                            nuclear weapons powers.</p>
                        <p rend="center">B. Views of the U.S. Interest in Southern Africa</p>
                        <p>In weighing the range of U.S. interests in southern Africa, there is
                            basic consensus within the U.S. Government:</p>
                        <p>1. Although the U.S. has various interests in the region, it has none
                            which could be classified as vital security interests.</p>
                        <p>2. Our political interests in the region are important because the racial
                            policies of the white states have become a major international issue.
                            Therefore, because other countries have made it so, our foreign policy
                            must take into account the domestic policies of the white regimes. Most
                            non-white nations in the world in varying degrees would tend to judge
                                <pb n="32" facs="0071" xml:id="pg_32"/>conspicuous U.S.
                            cooperation with the white regimes as condoning their racial
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>3. The racial problems of southern Africa probably will grow more acute
                            over time, perhaps leading to violent internal upheavals and greater
                            involvement of the communist powers. Though these developments may be
                            years or even decades ahead, U.S. policy should take account now of the
                            risks to our interests and possible involvement over this uncertain
                            future.</p>
                        <p>There are specific differences of view within the government regarding
                            future trends in southern Africa and the U.S. role in the area. These
                            contrasting views are central to a judgment of U.S. policy options. The
                            following reflect a basic intellectual disagreement within the
                            government in approaching the southern African problem:</p>
                        <p rend="italic">(1) U.S. Involvement to Promote Change</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">U.S. efforts for constructive change</hi>: Some argue
                            that racism and colonialism are central issues in African and world
                            politics. The race issue in southern Africa has already led to armed
                            conflict and disharmony which will spread if left unchecked. The U.S. is
                            obligated under the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter to do
                            what we can to promote the non-discriminatory observance of human
                            rights.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Non-involvement</hi>: Others reply that our
                            disagreement with the domestic policies of any state should not govern
                            the pursuit of our foreign policy interests in that state. Our concern
                            with internal human rights problems has caused us to ignore serious
                            cross-border infiltration which is a more legitimate <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> concern and could lead to larger
                            conflicts in the area. The actions taken against the white states,
                            particularly on South West Africa and Rhodesia, have no valid basis in
                            international law.</p>
                        <p rend="italic">(2) Violent vs. Evolutionary Change</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Violent Change</hi>: Some argue that mounting violence
                            is inevitable unless change occurs and that there is no prospect for
                            peaceful change in the racial policies of the white regimes, embedded as
                            they are in prejudice, religious doctrine and self-interest and
                            bolstered by economic prosperity, particularly in South Africa. The
                            results will be: (a) black guerrilla and terrorist activity on a growing
                            scale within these countries until change occurs, and (b) because of
                            their support of the blacks, the Soviets and Chinese will become the
                            major beneficiaries of the conflict.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Evolutionary Change</hi>: Others contend that there
                            will be violence up to a point, since change can only come slowly. But
                            there is some prospect for peaceful change in the white states in
                            response to internal economic and social forces. In any event, peaceful
                            evolution is the only avenue to change because (a) black violence only
                            produces internal <pb n="33" facs="0072" xml:id="pg_33"/>reaction, and
                            (b) military realities rule out a black victory at any stage. Moreover,
                            there are reasons to question the depth and permanence of black resolve.
                            Recently there has been a decline in the level of insurgency.
                            Neighboring black states—vital to successful guerrilla activity—will
                            choose to preserve their own security in the face of inevitable
                            punishing white retaliation at an early stage of any significant
                            guerrilla warfare.</p>
                        <p rend="italic">(3) The Possibility of U.S. Influence Toward Evolutionary
                            Change</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">No Influence</hi>: Some contend that we can neither
                            reform the whites nor restrain the blacks. Racial repression is deeply
                            ingrained in the whites—the product of tradition, economic privilege and
                            fears for their survival. These attitudes are not amenable to the kinds
                            of influence one nation exerts upon another through peaceful
                            international relations. Only isolation and stronger forms of pressure
                            (i.e. force or mandatory economic sanctions backed by blockade) could
                            have any impact.</p>
                        <p>Yet, they argue, without some change in the whites we cannot hope to
                            influence the blacks to accept “peaceful evolution” as a substitute for
                            force. The blacks will see such advice as a fundamental U.S. betrayal of
                            their cause.</p>
                        <p>A related school of thought believes that in this sensitive area any
                            effort by the U.S. to exert influence on internal policies could retard
                            rather than stimulate the natural dynamics of change in the
                            white-dominated societies.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Some Influence</hi>: Others argue that our tactical
                            encouragement of economic and social forces already at work within the
                            white regimes can constitute marginal but important influence for
                            change. That influence, however, can be exerted only subtly and over
                            several years. We should not give up whatever chance we have—through
                            contacts with whites as well as blacks—to defuse the dangerous tensions
                            in the area and to demonstrate the alternatives to the disastrous racial
                            policies of the white regimes. Exposure of these regimes to the outside
                            world is necessary if there is to be peaceful change. Isolation of the
                            white societies has only intensified repressive policies. Moreover,
                            external efforts to force change by pressure or coercion have unified
                            the whites and produced an obdurate counter-reaction.</p>
                        <p rend="italic">(4) Importance of Political vs. Other Tangible
                            Interests</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Political Interests</hi>: Some argue that racial
                            hostility as a reaction to centuries of white predominance is a
                            relatively new political force in the world, gaining power and
                            effectiveness as the developing countries become independent and control
                            access to their own territories. We cannot foresee exactly when race
                            will become a major factor in the international power balance, but that
                            time is coming. It is equally clear <pb n="34" facs="0073"
                                xml:id="pg_34"/>that the racial repression by the white regimes in
                            southern Africa is now the most volatile racial problem on the
                            international scene.</p>
                        <p>For the non-white states, they also argue, the reckoning of support on
                            the racial issue in their time of weakness will determine their
                            friendship or hostility for the U.S. a generation hence when their
                            importance in world politics may be substantially greater. Thus failure
                            to demonstrate an appreciation today of African aspirations may
                            eventually (a) forfeit great influence to the communist powers, who have
                            taken a clear position in support of black states and liberation
                            movements and (b) jeopardize our strategic and economic interests in
                            non-white Africa. Any anti-U.S. or pro-communist reactions, however, are
                            unlikely to be either solid or early, and many black states are very
                            aware of the dangers of association with the communists.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Other Tangible Interests</hi>: Others reply that our
                            interests in the white states of southern Africa—albeit having a
                            relatively low priority among such interests worldwide—are clearly worth
                            retaining at their present political cost. These interests include
                            access to air and naval facilities for which alternatives are expensive
                            or less satisfactory, a major space tracking station, and significant
                            investment and balance of trade advantages. Our political concerns and
                            other interests may be accommodated because (a) the great majority of
                            non-white states in Africa and elsewhere will put their own immediate
                            self-interest ahead of penalizing us for our interests in the white
                            states, and (b) even the most directly involved black states (Zambia and
                            Tanzania) will temper their reaction because our continued good will and
                            support for their cause will be important, and they know it. In any
                            event other countries will judge our standing on the racial issue
                            worldwide by the outcome of the racial problems in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. Present Policy</p>
                        <p>The aim of present policy is to try to balance our economic, scientific
                            and strategic interests in the white states with the political interest
                            of dissociating the U.S. from the white minority regimes and their
                            repressive racial policies. Decisions have been made ad hoc, on a
                            judgment of benefits and political costs at a given moment. But the
                            strength of this policy—its flexibility—is also its weakness. Policy is
                            not precisely recorded. And because there have been significant
                            differences of view within the government as to how much weight should
                            be given to these conflicting factors in any given instance, certain
                            decisions have been held in suspense “pending review of the over-all
                            policy”—e.g., visits of naval vessels to South African ports enroute to
                            and from the Indian Ocean or Viet-Nam, export licensing of equipment for
                            South Africa, Angola and Mozambique, which might be used either for
                            military or civilian purposes, participation of South African military
                            personnel in Department of Defense correspondence courses.</p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_35"/>
                        <p>This policy seeks progress towards majority rule through political
                            arrangements which guarantee increasing participation by the whole
                            population. Tangible evidence of such progress has been considered a
                            precondition for improved U.S. relations with the white states. In the
                            case of South Africa, the following are illustrative of the types of
                            actions which that government might take to improve relations with the
                            U.S.:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Bilateral</hi>. Permit assignment of non-whites to
                            U.S. Embassy and consulates. Non-discriminatory treatment of U.S. naval
                            personnel and merchant marine crews ashore. Non-discriminatory visa
                            policy. Permit more South African non-whites in U.S. exchange programs.
                            Facilitate U.S. official access to non-white areas of South Africa and
                            South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Internal</hi>. Eliminate job reservation and abolish

                            Move towards qualified franchise for non-whites.</p>

                            of visiting non-whites such as sportsmen and businessmen.</p>
                        <p>(It is realized that most of the foregoing are unrealistic under present
                            circumstances, but they illustrate the directions in which change might
                            be sought.)</p>
                        <p>Following are the actions taken toward the different countries and areas
                            which, in sum, constitute our present policy toward southern Africa:</p>

                        <p>We maintain limited but formally correct diplomatic relations, making
                            clear our opposition to apartheid. In the early 1960’s the U.S. played a
                            leading role in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in denouncing
                            South Africa’s racial policies. We led the effort in 1963 to establish
                            and we continue to support the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> arms
                            embargo on South Africa. We have avoided association with the South
                            African Defense Force except for limited military attaché contacts. We
                            supported the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> declaration that South
                            Africa’s mandate over South West Africa had terminated, and calling for

                            mandatory economic sanctions, in part because there is no evidence that
                            these actions would be efficacious. Moreover, we have sought to avoid

                            Africa. This has involved aide-mémoires, attendance at trials to assure
                            international observation of certain legal and judicial practices, and
                            cooperation with private groups in the American bar to reinforce in
                            South Africa traditions of respect for the rule of law. We also have
                            sought to deepen our identification with the non-white majorities
                            through personal contacts, public appearances and our exchange program.

                            becomes necessary or desirable to close the station. The future need for

                            under review. The tentative conclusions are that the station is no

                            profitable economic relations with South Africa despite the official
                            approach of neither encouraging nor discouraging investment (apart from
                            the Foreign Direct Investment Program) and keeping trade facilitative

                            sanctions to them.)</p>
                        <p>The mandatory sanctions program was devised by the British as a
                            compromise between the use of force, which they were unwilling to
                            contemplate largely because of domestic considerations, and doing
                            nothing, which would have jeopardized their relations with the black
                            African states and other Afro-Asian members of the Commonwealth. The
                            United States cooperated with the U.K. largely for the same reasons. We
                            also anticipated that failure to devise peaceful means to influence the
                            Smith regime toward a satisfactory settlement would encourage extremists
                            and dangerous instability in the area. Although it was recognized from
                            the start that the sanctions program would be an imperfect instrument
                            there was a tendency to overestimate the effectiveness of sanctions,
                            which have been weakened by numerous and sometimes large (South Africa
                            and Portugal) loopholes. Similarly, although there was awareness that
                            the convenience of certain economic interests would be disrupted through
                            sanctions, there was a tendency to underestimate the extent to which
                            criticism, both political and economic, would multiply with the passage
                            of time and evidence of the program’s lack of success.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has continued to recognize British sovereignty in the colony,
                            and refused to support the use of force by either side to the dispute.
                            We maintain a reduced staff at our Consulate General in Salisbury which
                            continues to operate under exequaturs from the British Crown. With the
                            Southern Rhodesian determination to declare itself a republic,
                            increasingly negative reactions may be anticipated from African nations
                            to our continuing presence in Salisbury. The Consulate General provides
                            citizenship and welfare services to approximately 1,100 American

                            sympathize with the aspirations of the Angolans and Mozambicans for
                            self-determination.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. maintains cordial relations with the five black-ruled states of
                            the area, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. We have
                            Ambassadors in Malawi and Zambia. Since their independence we have
                            maintained Chargés in Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland and these
                            countries are pressing us for the assignment of resident Ambassadors.
                            These countries consider the level of our diplomatic representatives to
                            be an important manifestation of U.S. sympathy and support.</p>
                        <p>As with all developing countries, an important factor in our relations is
                            the level and kind of aid we can provide. Under current policies <gloss

                            Program. Investment guarantees are available, and the U.S. extends
                            additional help through <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss> 480 food
                            donations, and Peace Corps programs in four of the five black countries.
                            However, there is a body of opinion which considers that programs of
                            bilateral technical assistance are necessary in these states because of
                            their generally isolated and enclave location. Bilateral assistance has
                            been limited as a matter of policy to 10 concentration countries in
                            Africa, none of which are in the southern region. World-wide <gloss

                        <p>A further problem with these countries is the Conte amendment to foreign

                                equivalent to the amount spent for the purchase of sophisticated

                            application of the Conte amendment may be seen by the black states as
                            evidence that the U.S. is more sympathetic to the status quo of the
                            white regimes than the aspirations of the blacks.</p>

                            the last five years. We played a leading role in the arms embargo
                            against South Africa, the determination that South Africa’s mandate over
                            South West Africa had terminated, and on mandatory economic sanctions
                            against Southern Rhodesia. However, these actions largely exhausted the
                            store of measures we were prepared to take on these issues.</p>
                        <p>The Afro-Asians have steadily increased pressures to exclude South Africa
                            from the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, for sanctions against South

                            states far out in front of the U.S. and some other Free World countries.
                            We have consistently resisted efforts to exclude South Africa from

                            region for propaganda advantage and to gain political influence with

                        <p>—To encourage moderation of the current rigid racial and colonial
                            policies of the white regimes.</p>
                        <p>These objectives are to a degree contradictory—pursuit of one may make
                            difficult the successful pursuit of one or more of the others. Moreover,
                            views as to the relative priority among these objectives vary widely,
                            depending primarily upon the perception of the nature of the problems in
                            the area and U.S. interests there (see I.B).</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Range of Choice</p>
                        <p>The general policy question centers on U.S. posture toward the white
                            regimes—a key element in our relations with the black states in the area
                            and a factor of varying degrees of importance throughout the
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>But the range of feasible policy options is limited. On one extreme our
                            interests do not justify consideration of U.S. military intervention in
                            the area. On the other extreme we cannot accept or endorse either the
                            racial or colonial policies of the white regimes. Nor can we identify
                            ourselves with violent or repressive solutions to the area’s problems on
                            either side of the confrontation. The essential choice is among:</p>
                        <p>(a) Movement towards normal relations with the white regimes to protect
                            and enhance our economic, strategic and scientific interests (Option
                            1).</p>
                        <p>(b) Broader association with both black and white states in an effort to
                            encourage moderation in the white states, to enlist cooperation of the
                            black states in reducing tensions and the likelihood of increasing
                            cross-border violence, and to encourage improved relations among states
                            in area (Option 2).</p>
                        <p>(c) Increased identification with and support for the black states of the
                            region, as a pre-condition to pursuit of our minimum necessary economic,
                            strategic and scientific interests in the white states (Option 3).</p>
                        <p>(d) Limited association with the white states and closer association with
                            the blacks in an effort to retain some economic, scientific and
                            strategic interests in the white states while maintaining a posture on
                            the racial issue which the blacks will accept, though opposing violent
                            solutions to the problems of the region (Option 4).</p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_41"/>
                        <p>(e) Dissociation from the white regimes with closer relations with the
                            black states in an effort to enhance our standing on the racial issue in
                            Africa and internationally (Option 5).</p>
                        <p>(f) Increased U.S. measures of coercion, short of armed force,
                            bilaterally and on an international basis, to induce constructive change
                            in white-regime race policies (Option 6).</p>
                        <p>Each option represents a range of actions, with some flexibility of
                            choice among specific means without altering the premise or general
                            strategy of the option. The purpose of this paper is to afford the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> a choice on basic posture
                            toward southern Africa. It is not intended to be a specific scenario for
                            operational action, and the examples in each option are the types of
                            action which would be consistent with the option’s thrust but are
                            neither comprehensive nor necessarily in each case the specific action
                            which would be selected.</p>
                        <p>A satisfactory arrangement regarding South Africa’s handling of gold can
                            continue to be sought under any of the options, but it would probably be
                            more difficult to achieve under Option 5, and particularly under Option
                            6.</p>

                        <p>Our disagreements with the internal policies of governments in power in
                            the region should not govern our relations with either the black or
                            white states. We should follow a policy of pursuing our tangible
                            interests throughout the region. In seeking to induce change, we have
                            erroneously supported <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> actions on
                            Rhodesia and South West Africa based on questionable premises. While we
                            cannot reverse our participation in these actions overnight, we can
                            begin to withdraw from implementation of them. The political costs of
                            closer relations with the white states will not be excessive.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Posture</p>
                        <p>We would move to normalize our relations with all governments of the
                            area, recognizing that reversal of our support for international actions
                            already taken on Rhodesia and South West Africa will require some time.
                            While we would make limited declarations of moral disapproval of the
                            racial and colonial policies of the white governments, we would take no
                            concrete measures to induce change and place no restrictions on the
                            pursuit of our tangible interests. We would assume the risks of reaction
                            against us in the black areas of the region and the rest of Africa.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cons</p>
                        <p>1. Would require repudiation of previous U.S. actions in <gloss

                        <p>4. Would risk forfeiting to communist powers primary influence with black

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Premise</p>
                        <p>The whites are here to stay and the only way that constructive change can
                            come about is through them. There is no hope for the blacks to gain the
                            political rights they seek through violence, which will only lead to
                            chaos and increased opportunities for the communists. We can, by
                            selective relaxation of our stance toward the white regimes, encourage
                            some modification of their current racial and colonial policies and
                            through more substantial economic assistance to the black states (a
                            total of about $5 million annually in technical assistance to the black
                            states) help to draw the two groups together and exert some influence on
                            both for peaceful change. Our tangible interests form a basis for our
                            contacts in the region, and these can be maintained at an acceptable
                            political cost.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General Posture</p>
                        <p>We would maintain public opposition to racial repression but relax
                            political isolation and economic restrictions on the white states. We
                            would begin by modest indications of this relaxation, broadening the
                            scope of our relations and contacts gradually and to some degree in
                            response to tangible—albeit small and gradual—moderation of white
                            policies. Without openly taking a position undermining the U.K. and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> on Rhodesia, we would be more
                            flexible in our attitude toward the Smith regime. We would take present
                            Portuguese policies as suggesting further changes in the Portuguese
                            Territories. At the same time we would take diplomatic steps to convince
                            the black states of the area that their current liberation and majority
                            rule aspirations in the south are not attainable by violence and that
                            their only hope for a peaceful and prosperous future lies in closer
                            relations with white-dominated states. We would emphasize our belief
                            that closer relations will help to bring change in the white states. We
                            would give increased and more flexible economic aid to black states of
                            the area to focus their attention on their internal development and to
                            give them a motive to cooperate in reducing tensions. We would encourage
                            economic assistance from South Africa to the developing black
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>This option accepts, at least over a 3 to 5 year period, the prospect of
                            unrequited U.S. initiatives toward the whites and some opposition from
                            the blacks in order to develop an atmosphere conducive to change in
                            white attitudes through persuasion and erosion. To encourage this <pb

                            would indicate our willingness to accept political arrangements short of

                            broadened political participation in some form by the whole

                        <p>1. Would encourage existing tendencies to broaden relations between black
                            states and white and thus reduce tensions—South Africa’s new outward
                            policy, Zambia’s trade and sub-rosa political contacts with South Africa
                            and Portugal.</p>
                        <p>2. Would preserve U.S. economic, scientific and strategic interests in
                            the white states and would expand opportunities for profitable trade and
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>3. Relaxation of the U.S. attitude toward the whites could help lift
                            their present siege mentality; and it would encourage elements among the
                            whites seeking to extend South African relationships with black
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>4. U.S. diplomatic support and economic aid offer the black states an
                            alternative to the recognized risks of mounting communist influence.</p>
                        <p>5. Increased aid would also give us greater influence to caution the
                            black states against violent confrontation and give them a tangible
                            stake in accepting the prospects of gradual change.</p>
                        <p>6. Would reduce a major irritant in our relations with Portugal, and
                            afford the <persName corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName> government
                            opportunity for liberalization.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cons</p>
                        <p>1. Relaxation of the U.S. stance towards white states could be taken by
                            the whites as a vindication of their policies. Many black states, led by
                            Zambia and Tanzania, probably would charge us with subordinating our
                            professed ideals to material interests and tolerating <pb n="46"
                                facs="0085" xml:id="pg_46"/>white-regime policies. This reaction
                            could adversely affect, in varying degrees, our political, economic and
                            strategic interests in the black states.</p>
                        <p>2. There is a serious question whether pro-Western leaders of the black
                            states could continue to justify their stance to their populations if
                            the U.S. officially declared its opposition to current liberation
                            efforts. Radical and communist states would be the beneficiaries.</p>
                        <p>3. Unilateral U.S. relaxation of sanctions against Rhodesia would be a
                            highly visible violation of our international obligations and would be
                            damaging both to the U.S. and to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. The current thrust of South African domestic policy does not involve
                            any basic change in the racial segregation system, which is anathema to
                            the black states. There is virtually no evidence that change might be
                            forthcoming in these South African policies as a result of any approach
                            on our part.</p>
                        <p>5. Requires extensive diplomatic and economic involvement in a situation
                            in which the solution is extremely long-range and the outcome doubtful
                            at best.</p>
                        <p>6. It is doubtful that the additional aid contemplated would be
                            sufficiently great to influence the black states in the direction
                            indicated.</p>

                        <p>An effective U.S. role in the region and in Africa requires credibility
                            with the black states. A more active demonstration of interest in the

                            a basis for carrying out with minimum political risk, essential official
                            policies in the white states. We can by so doing meet our minimal
                            requirements in the area and exert a greater influence on the course of

                        <p>2. Would afford access to black states of region and improve our standing

                        <p>3. Expanded aid to the black states would enable us to offset criticisms

                        <p>4. Would retain flexibility for future movements towards either white or

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cons</p>
                        <p>1. Preparatory moves in black states might not give clear enough results
                            nor be sufficient to offset African criticism for possible later
                            activities in white states.</p>
                        <p>2. Association with the white regimes at any time is vulnerable to
                            exploitation by the communists and African extremists.</p>
                        <p>3. Substantial <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> loan in Portuguese
                            Territories could cause adverse repercussions in Zambia and

                            black states.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pros</p>
                        <p>1. Clear U.S. position on side of majority rule brings our actions into
                            alignment with our declared political position and therefore would
                            increase our influence throughout black Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Decisive action by U.S. might induce white regimes to make needed
                            reforms before violence erupts.</p>
                        <p>3. Policy puts U.S. on eventual winning side, thus undercutting communist
                            influence on liberation effort and insuring long-term dominant U.S.
                            influence in most developed part of Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cons</p>
                        <p>1. U.S. initiative in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would be
                            unlikely to gain support of U.K., France and perhaps others, leaving us
                            to go it alone.</p>
                        <p>2. Experience with Rhodesia suggests that even stringent sanctions tend
                            to increase siege mentality and unify white minorities.</p>
                        <p>3. Heavy repercussions from sanctions would fall on new, economically
                            weak African states, particularly Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. These
                            would have to be given economic compensation.</p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_54"/>
                        <p>4. The U.S. would have sacrificed a range of valuable material interests
                            in the southern region without reasonable assurances that disruptive
                            conflict would be thereby averted.</p>

                        <p>At Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>’s
                            request, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName>
                            called at 3:00 December 15 to discuss the visa case of US tennis star
                            Arthur Ashe. <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> reported
                            that Ashe had applied for a South African visa this morning. He was most
                            courteously received, and when an <gloss target="#t_INS_1">INS</gloss>
                            photographer asked to take his picture with the South African Consul
                            General, Ashe declined. <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName>
                            said he thought this wise, as it is preferable to avoid publicity over
                            the case while it is being considered.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> said the Ashe
                            visa case is a matter of concern to the US, as the Administration
                            genuinely wishes to improve relations with South Africa. Incidents like
                            those over the visa applications of Congressmen <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ROR_1"
                                >Reid</persName> have a special importance, as they tend to inhibit
                            actions on the part of the US that might lead to smoother relations with
                            South Africa. He said approval of Ashe’s visa application would enable
                            the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to show itself in a more
                            favorable light than it had done in the <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Diggs</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_ROR_1">Reid</persName>
                            cases, and he urged that the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> give
                            Ashe’s application careful, and hopefully favorable consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_55"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> responded that he would
                            relay Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>’s comments
                            and request to Pretoria, as he had done with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RW_1">Rountree</persName>’s request for an appointment
                            with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName> and
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> hoped the visa
                            could be issued, but he pointed out the case was difficult both because
                            of hostile statements Ashe had made about South Africa and because of
                            the coincidence of the tennis tournament and South Africa’s general
                            elections next April.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> said we have no
                            confirmation that Ashe had actually made the statements attributed to
                            him by Sports Minister Waring. He said Ashe is no extremist, and we
                            believe he wants to play tennis in South Africa, <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> engage in politics there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> observed that Mr.

                                target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> had just visited South Africa and
                            asked whether he, a Negro, had found it “indescribably bad”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> said Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> had been well received and
                            every effort was made to ensure that no incidents took place. Without
                            such special measures, however, it would have been very difficult for
                            him indeed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> replied that numbers of
                            Negro boxers have visited South Africa from the US without incident, but
                            he granted that there is a real problem in the restrictions imposed on
                            non-whites.</p>
                        <p>The meeting concluded after about 15 minutes.</p>

                                telegram 206809 to Pretoria, December 12, the Department outlined
                                the next steps for <persName corresp="#p_RW_1">Rountree</persName>
                                to facilitate Ashe’s visa. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                        <p>1. I met last evening upon my return with Foreign Minister to urge
                            issuance of visa to Arthur Ashe. I explained personal interest of
                            President and Secretary and effects denial of visa could have.</p>
                        <p>2. Foreign Minister was obviously impressed by what I said. While making
                            clear he not repeat not purporting give me reply at this junc<pb n="56"
                                facs="0095" xml:id="pg_56"/>ture, he spoke at length about problems
                            confronting government re visa issue. Coming as it does at critical time
                            in election campaign, government’s treatment of matter might become very
                            important domestic issue. Moreover, problem increased by highly
                            inflammatory statements made earlier by Ashe and widely reported by
                                <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> press. Particularly damaging were
                            alleged statements that Ashe would like to drop bomb on Johannesburg,
                            and that if he should come to <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> it
                            would be for purpose of breaking crack in wall of <gloss
                                target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> racial policies. Foreign Minister had
                            understood Ashe more recently had commented that any visit to <gloss
                                target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> would be to play tennis, not to engage
                            in politics, but damage had been done. He speculated as to whether visa
                            might be issued on specific conditions, but to this I replied that offer
                            of conditional visa to Congressman <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1"
                                >Diggs</persName> had been considered even more offensive than if
                            visa had been denied outright. Nature and wording of conditions would of
                            course be important aspect. Foreign Minister then speculated as to
                            whether, in lieu of conditional visa, Ashe might unilaterally give
                            “undertaking” concerning his activities while here. To be useful for
                                <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> domestic purpose, however, there
                            would have to be some publicity which he and I agreed might present
                            difficult problems. This possibility was not, however, ruled out.</p>
                        <p>3. Foreign Minister said that he had already spoken with all of his
                            colleagues, including Waring, who might make statements on visa
                            question, and in response to my request made through Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_THLT_1">Taswell</persName> he thought no South
                            African Government official would make further statements with respect
                            to matter pending completion of our discussions. He expressed strong
                            view that I should see Prime Minister, who presently in remote part of
                            Port Elizabeth area, and asked if I would accompany him on visit there.
                            In light my affirmative reply he later telephoned Prime Minister and
                            arranged that we would meet him in Port Elizabeth on Friday, December
                            19, returning Pretoria that afternoon.</p>
                        <p>4. I shall report further after my talks with Prime Minister. Meanwhile I
                            am hopeful <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will not further reduce
                            flexibility by additional public statements.</p>
                        <p>5. Would appreciate early indication status Ashe’s formal visa
                            request.</p>

                        <p>RN—This is a peripheral issue. But we need a frank discussion; we must
                            cover the operational decisions. I will make no final decisions today.
                            It is an important question, as there are moral and domestic political
                            issues involved. Many people have been asking about this. We have put
                            them off by saying that there was an <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"

                            Southern Africa.</p>

                                >Rountree</persName> when he was here recently? He is a very

                                report concluded that due to the strength of these regimes, and the
                                weakness of the insurgents, there was little prospect for change in
                                the region for the foreseeable future.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>—We have approached this
                            policy question in two stages: to reach a decision on general posture,
                            first, and then to deal <pb n="58" facs="0097" xml:id="pg_58"/>with
                            specific operational issues. The interdepartmental group has had a major
                            job in pulling together this complex subject.</p>
                        <p>We face, Mr. President, three broad choices. First, there is the approach
                            favored by Dean Acheson<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Acheson’s paper,
                                “U.S. Policies Toward Southern Africa Require Change,” April 30,
                                suggested the United States should abandon its current policies
                                toward southern Africa, which he argued “align this country among
                                the adversaries of those regimes.” Acheson offered the following
                                reasons to support his argument: the policies were impossible to
                                achieve, they were contrary to U.S. national interests, and they
                                were frustrating the common interest of the United States and of
                                both the black and white nations of southern Africa in the stability
                                and development of that area. (National Archives, <persName

                                Acheson, Dean)</note> and others, to release restrictions on the
                            white states and to avoid any involvement at all in the black-white
                            rivalries. Second, there is a policy choice of some limited association
                            with both sides. Third, there is the option to disengage from the white
                            states and move toward the blacks.</p>

                        <p>RN—What is the total aid to the black states?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—About $100 million.</p>
                        <p>RN—What is the attitude of the Congress?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—At the last go around, it
                            was about the same.</p>
                        <p>RN—What about <gloss target="#t_PL_1">PL</gloss> 480?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—Our money goes for a
                            variety of things, capital development, assistance to regional projects
                            and multi-donor aid. It is only modest.</p>
                        <p>RN—What about trade? I understand that six percent of the people (the
                            whites in South Africa) produce 40 percent of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> of the continent.</p>
                        <p>Siciliano—We have $1 billion invested in South Africa. That is just South
                            Africa alone. We have a $200 million favorable trade balance.</p>
                        <p>RN—How much do we have invested in black Africa?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—The investment in black
                            Africa is about equal to the investment in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>RN—I think we have to be realistic on this question and straddle it. It
                            is obvious that we have to avoid the colonialist label but we must
                            analyze where our national interest lies and not worry too much about
                            other peoples’ domestic policies.</p>
                        <p>To what extent do the black states respond to overtures from the
                            whites?</p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_59"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—With great reluctance. The
                            Ivory Coast carries on some quiet trade. Malawi has diplomatic
                            relations. But there is no other real exchange.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IG_1">IG</gloss> asked the question what the US can
                            and cannot do, and what is the extent of our influence. Economic forces
                            will ultimately bring change, but our ability to exert influence is
                            minimal.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>—There is the moral
                            argument. If we could do anything then we would have a moral
                            responsibility. But since we can’t do anything, there is no
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>RN—Well, the whites can’t go home. It is a practical problem we have come
                            up against. They are there to stay.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_REL_1">Richardson</persName>—I agree there is no
                            real solution. A white minority ruled by a black majority will not work
                            and a black majority ruled by a while minority does not work. There must
                            be partition. The whites feel they have a right to be there, as we do in
                            the U.S.</p>
                        <p>RN—What about the U.N.? Is this a hot issue?</p>
                        <p>Yost—There are operational problems all the time. There are 40 African
                            members, 1/3 of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, increasingly
                            frustrated and restive and resentful. They want forceful action. It is
                            hard to apply any option which will satisfy them.</p>
                        <p>RN—How can we avoid <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> votes on this
                            question?</p>
                        <p>Yost—We can’t. Sometimes it is a vote for human rights, sometimes it is
                            an attack on Portugal.</p>
                        <p>RN—Can’t we roll with the punch? That is the only useful thing to do. We
                            don’t accomplish a thing by isolating the Portuguese.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—It is a difference between
                            New York and African governments. Very few African delegations have
                            precise instructions. They may be extreme on one vote since that is the
                            way it goes in the African caucus; but home governments would not have
                            restricted them to go that way. We should generate greater communication
                            between African capitals and New York.</p>
                        <p>Yost—Rhodesia and Southwest Africa are major problems.</p>
                        <p>RN—Should we send the Secretary of State to Africa?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>—I agree with <persName

                            concerned primarily with bilateral relations and not with the <gloss

                        <p>RN—That’s what they raised with me when I was there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>—There has been no real
                            penetration by the Soviets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>—They are just as white as
                            we are.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>—On the whole, our
                            relations are pretty good with Africa.</p>
                        <p>Yost—Southwest Africa is a problem of a legal mandate. We are caught on
                            this one. It would be helpful to disengage. Rhodesia also is pretty well
                            stuck. It is a peculiar place, only 4% white.</p>

                        <p>Lincoln—There was a strong objection in the past to port calls, with no
                            refueling.</p>

                            would not agree to refuelling stops without shore leaves. <persName

                            tons to the surface. They have an additional grievance, the ferro-alloy

                                >PriMin</gloss> in Port Elizabeth to discuss Ashe visa matter.
                            FonMin and I flew there today where we had session in hotel with <gloss

                        <p>2. At outset I told <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> something
                            of my visit to Washington and said on basis of my talks there I could
                            assure him U.S. administration genuinely wished improve relations with
                            South Africa. However, we deeply concerned that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> treatment of visas for some Americans (inter alia
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> and <persName

                            flexibility. I made special point of interest of President and Secretary

                            that visa be granted. I said I aware from my previous talk with FonMin
                            that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> attitude had been materially
                            affected by earlier statements by Ashe which led it to conclude his

                                >Diggs</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ROR_1">Reid</persName>.
                            I said high officials who knew Ashe personally considered him
                            responsible and had confidence he would conduct himself here as guest of
                            S.A.</p>

                            appreciation re attitude of President and other administration leaders
                            concerning relations with S.A. He said South Africa fully accepted
                            American leadership of free world and desired to be as close to U.S. as
                            we permitted. He had been greatly impressed by President <persName

                            areas of agreement wherever they existed, recognizing that we had
                            different approaches to our respective internal problems.</p>
                        <p>4. He wished make clear that <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            attitude toward visa for Ashe was not repeat not because of his race,
                            any more than denial of unconditional visa to Congressman <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> was because he was Negro. It was
                            most unfortunate that application was for visit to S.A. during crucial
                            election period. Ashe’s recent statement to which I had referred had
                            included phrase which could present real problems, and would be seized
                            upon by Hertzog group to “clobber” government if visa granted. That
                            phrase dealt with Ashe’s undertaking that any political remarks he might
                            make would be only after several weeks following his departure from
                            Johannesburg, that is, after the elections. Opposition already was
                            preparing groundwork for charge that this was concocted by <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> and Americans so as not to embarrass
                            National Party election prospects. Statement thus made favorable
                            decision on application even more difficult.</p>
                        <p>5. Turning specifically to internal political situation, <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> said he confident that, in
                            absense new ammunition in hands of Hertzog group, it would be
                            “destroyed” in elections. However, he wished to tell me frankly that if
                            group succeeded in gaining even one or two seats, result would have
                            snowball effect which could end in political disaster, and he simply
                            could not risk destroying his party and thus stability of country. His
                            decisions and actions must be based upon knowledge that substantial
                            majority of Afrikaners and National Party members were in fact opposed
                            to his outward policy, objected to “too much” being done for non-whites,
                            criticized his refusal to enact legislation making Afrikaans the only
                            official language, and strongly resisted his sports policy. They had to
                            be carried along and he could do this, but he convinced that Ashe visa
                            question, if mishandled by him, could put his back to the wall by
                            setting into motion domestic political forces of considerably more
                            significance than the outside world realized.</p>
                        <p>6. At this point I spelled out possible consequences to US–SA relations
                            of refusal of visa including increased pressures against improved
                            relations, demands for retaliation against South African athletes com<pb
                                n="65" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_65"/>peting in the U.S., etc. I
                            observed that from what <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> had
                            said, choice for him difficult, but I thought so much would be
                            endangered by negative decision as to warrant his willingness give
                            further thought to means permitting Ashe to come. <gloss
                                target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> responded that his present
                            thinking was that domestic political consequences of issuance of visa
                            would be such that he must be willing to accept any external consequence
                            of its refusal, as regrettable as this might be. He observed that if we
                            could get over the period immediately ahead, matters of this sort could
                            be handled more easily. He was determined to permit Maoris to
                            participate in S.A. as members foreign team whose selection not made for
                            political purposes. He then put forth a suggestion that if Ashe were to
                            come to S.A. as member of U.S. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1"
                                >Davis</persName> Cup team, not as an individual, he would be
                            welcome. I asked if he meant only after elections, to which he replied
                            he would be willing proceed with this even before elections because
                            principle was so sound that it could be defended against attacks by
                            opposition. It was Ashe coming as individual that presented special
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>7. I expressed considerable doubt that U.S. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1"
                                >Davis</persName> Cup team would accept invitation to play in South
                            Africa, particularly if it appeared device to get around Ashe individual
                            visa application. Moreover, I thought it unlikely that commitments of
                            members of team would in any event render this practical, at least in
                            near future. <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss>, strongly
                            supported by FonMin, urged that I nevertheless confidentially explore
                            this possibility of U.S. team playing S.A. team here at any time, before
                            or after elections.</p>
                        <p>8. At conclusion of talk, <gloss target="#t_PriMin_1">PriMin</gloss> said
                            if he were pressed now for final reply re Ashe visa, it would have to be
                            negative. He would prefer to discuss matter with Cabinet, members of
                            which now on vacation and dispersed throughout country. Next Cabinet
                            meeting would be in Cape Town in late January. He would prefer hold
                            matter until then, meanwhile giving it further thought himself. I
                            encouraged him to do so, and we arranged to pursue question again in
                            late January.</p>

                            doubt that this will result in favorable decision next month.<note n="4"

                            understanding has now been reached. Treasury issued a press release this
                            morning announcing “that a basis for a satisfactory mutual understanding
                            may be emerging.” (Tab B)<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">Tabs A and B are

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>The major countries adopted the two-tiered gold system in March 1968 to
                            divorce the monetary and private markets for gold—monetary gold now
                            moves between national authorities at $35 per ounce while all other
                            transations take place in private markets at whatever price develops
                            from supply and demand. This means that monetary authorities no longer
                            sell gold to private parties to hold the price to all comers to $35.</p>
                        <p>The agreement was a response to the crisis which began with the
                            devaluation of sterling in November 1967 and which bled $3 billion of
                            official gold—most of it from the U.S.—into private hands. It remains of
                            critical importance to the United States because it prevents private
                            purchases of gold from draining U.S. monetary reserves, and we are its
                            primary policemen.</p>
                        <p>The two-tiered system has worked so well that it now faces a problem
                            opposite to the problem which caused its creation: far from worrying
                            about increases in the gold price, there have recently been sharp price
                            declines. In fact, the free market price has declined precisely to
                            $35—the official price. The decline has occurred because of strengthened
                            confidence in the dollar, the decision to activate Special Drawing
                            Rights as a substitute for gold to augment international liquidity, and
                            the lure of Eurodollar deposits yielding more than 10 percent.</p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="0106" xml:id="pg_67"/>
                        <p>These price declines cause problems for the South Africans, whose major
                            export is gold. They also arouse great concern among some of the
                            European monetary authorities, who fear that the value of their gold
                            reserves will come into question if the free market price drops below
                            the official price. The two-tiered system is indeterminate on what
                            happens at this point.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Proposal</p>
                        <p>We therefore came under pressure from both South Africa and the Europeans
                            to agree to an arrangement which will place a $35 floor under the free
                            market. Our interest in doing so was essentially to pacify the
                            Europeans, whose cooperation we need continually in international
                            monetary matters—and who may have to hold a great many dollars next year
                            if our balance of payments turns as sour as most experts expect. In
                            addition, absent a U.S.-South African agreement it was possible that the
                            Europeans would make their own deal with South Africa, or set up a pool
                            among themselves to support the gold price, either of which would lead
                            to disorderly market conditions and a serious departure from our normal
                            monetary cooperation.</p>
                        <p>Treasury therefore negotiated an understanding with South Africa on the
                            basis of a proposal which we had had on the table since last spring, but
                            which South Africa had heretofore not accepted:</p>
                        <p>1. All newly mined gold to be sold into the free market when the price is

                            drops below $35.</p>
                        <p>3. Sales to monetary authorities permitted when South African balance of
                            payments deficits in a given time period exceed its gold production
                            during that period, after all of that production is sold into the free
                            market.</p>
                        <p>4. Sales to monetary authorities also permitted from a small “kitty” of
                            around $250 million, representing some of South Africa’s gold reserves
                            at the time the two-tiered system was inaugurated.</p>
                        <p>The understanding assures the maintenance of the two-tiered system and
                            assures that most of South Africa’s gold will go into the free market,
                            holding down the price and therefore promoting confidence in the
                            official price of gold. It does not provide a legal floor for the free
                            market, although it comes close to doing so psychologically.</p>

                        <p>Any U.S. understanding with South Africa will of course be subject to
                            some political criticism. In addition, some international monetary
                            experts—including Representatives Reuss and Widnall, the most
                            knowledgeable Congressmen in this area—are opposed to any U.S. conces<pb

                        <p>The U.S. proposal was developed solely on its monetary merits, however,
                            and will be readily justifiable. The understanding will clearly be part

                            this clear. The agreement should not cause any significant foreign or
                            domestic political problems; failure to settle would clearly have caused
                            problems with some of the Europeans, and now was the best time to settle
                            in view of the mechanism of the gold price and hence South Africa’s
                            negotiating position. State was fully involved in the development of the

                            with regard to U.S. policies toward Southern Africa:</p>
                        <p>1. Our Consulate in Salisbury, Rhodesia, will be retained so long as the
                            legal question of U.S. recognition does not arise. If this question does
                            arise—through British withdrawal of accreditation or by the Rhodesians’
                            raising the question of the Consulate’s status—the President will review
                            our policy.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to the issue of imports of chrome from Rhodesia, the
                            Departments of State, Treasury, Justice and Commerce should study the
                            Union Carbide case under the chairmanship of the Justice Department to
                            clarify its status under present regulations, with interdepartmental
                            differences to be resolved by Justice. This study should be submitted to
                            the White House by February 15.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> With this case
                            clarified, the more general issue of our policy on imports of Rhodesian
                            chrome should be presented again to the President for decision.</p>
                        <p>3. Naval vessels should continue <hi rend="italic">through 1970</hi> to
                            limit calls at South African ports to emergencies only.</p>
                        <p>4. The arms embargo on South Africa will be maintained.</p>
                        <p>5. Non-lethal equipment which has dual civilian and military uses will be
                            excepted from the arms embargo on Portugal.</p>

                        <p>6. Southwest African issues should be played down at the U.N. to head off
                            the prospect of a U.S. veto, until the situation clarifies. Once the
                            outcome of the U.N. Security Council debate is clear, the issue may be
                            presented again through the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> system

                        <p>The Smith regime has announced that the new Rhodesian Republican
                            Constitution came into force on March 2, 1970, and that the present
                            Parliament will be dissolved March 3. The dissolution represents the
                            final and formal break with Britain as the new Constitution provides for
                            an Acting President who replaces the British Crown as <pb n="74"
                                facs="0113" xml:id="pg_74"/>head of State. Although the Rhodesians
                            have made no formal announcement that the Republic came into existence
                            on March 2—and indications are that no announcement will be
                                made—<persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> has earlier
                            stated this would be the case on the dissolution of Parliament, and the
                            British have informed us they, too, consider the Republic to have been
                            established. The press is treating the dissolution in this way, and we
                            believe the terms of the Constitution support this interpretation.</p>
                        <p>General elections under provisions of the new Constitution will be held
                            on April 10. The new Parliament will sit and choose Rhodesia’s first
                            President. At this point the various steps involved in setting up the
                            institutions of the new Republic will have been completed.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary General has suggested
                            that the Security Council meet urgently to consider the Rhodesian
                            situation. Although it is not clear just what course the Council’s
                            deliberations may take, we can foresee two possibilities. There may be
                            strong pressures for extreme measures such as the use of force or
                            closure of the gaps in the Rhodesian sanctions program by its extension
                            to South Africa and Mozambique. Alternatively, there may be a general
                            condemnatory resolution which would also require the withdrawal of all
                            consular missions in Salisbury. Such a resolution would certainly be
                            supported by sufficient members, including the United Kingdom, to ensure
                            passage unless vetoed by a permanent member.</p>
                        <p>Quite apart from possible Security Council action, we can expect strong
                            condemnatory statements from black African states if we do not act now
                            to close our Consulate. The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> is in
                            the process of adopting a special resolution which, among other things,
                            will criticize those countries which still maintain consulates in
                            Salisbury. The Ethiopian Foreign Minister has indicated that even
                            moderate African states will have to condemn the failure of the U.S. to
                            close the Consulate and the Zambian Ambassador has expressed his
                            Government’s “grave concern.”</p>
                        <p>We have publicly and privately assured the British Government on various
                            occasions that we regarded it as the sovereign power in Rhodesia and
                            that we have no intention of recognizing the illegal regime in

                            effect, brought about a situation in which the continued maintenance of
                            our Consulate in Salisbury will be looked upon by the British, the
                            Africans and most of the international community as acceptance and
                            approval of the Smith regime. The continued presence of our Consular
                            office would become increasingly difficult to explain.</p>
                        <p>In light of the British request for an early decision to close, our
                            failure to heed the desires of the sovereign power could be interpreted
                            by the British and others as an affront to British sovereignty and
                            acceptance of the Rhodesian regime and Rhodesian statehood, even though
                            we may expressly deny we either approve or recognize the Smith regime.
                            It would be inconsistent for the United States to maintain that we do
                            not recognize either a state of Rhodesia or the Smith regime, but rather
                            consider Southern Rhodesia to be a non-self-governing territory with the
                            United Kingdom as the recognized sovereign, and yet continue to have a
                            consular mission in that territory against the expressed wishes of the
                            recognized sovereign.</p>
                        <p>In any <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consideration of the Rhodesian
                            question, the credibility and goodwill which we would gain by having
                            announced our intention to withdraw would enable us better to resist
                            pressures for extreme measures or to organize sufficient abstensions to
                            prevent passage of a resolution embodying them. Should we be faced with
                            a resolution requiring withdrawal of consular missions from Salisbury,
                            we would be spared the unpalatable choices of (1) appearing to have been
                            forced out of Salisbury; (2) maintaining a Consulate in violation of a
                            mandatory Security Council resolution; or (3) casting the first U.S.
                            veto.</p>
                        <p>The consular service and assistance requirements of American citizens in
                            Rhodesia can be adequately covered by our Consulate General in
                            Johannesburg. Maintenance of the office in Salisbury would offer no
                            material or other advantages comparable to the disadvantages
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>Closure of our office would give concrete meaning to our statements that
                            the United States neither condones nor approves of the discriminatory
                            racial policies of the minority regimes in southern Africa. It would
                            also remove an issue in our relations with the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss> and would save us from the political liabilities we
                            would encounter in Africa should we maintain the office.</p>
                        <p>In light of the coming into force of the Republican Constitution cutting
                            the last formal tie with the British Crown and of the British request
                            that we close the office, I believe we need to review the status of our
                            Consulate in Salisbury.</p>

                        <p>In light of the above, I believe we should close our Consulate in

                        <p>The President has decided to close the U.S. Consulate in Rhodesia in
                            response to the request of the Government of the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The President has directed that the announcement of our withdrawal be
                            consistent with our previous public position on the question of the
                            presence of our Consulate in Salisbury. The maintenance of the <pb
                                n="77" facs="0116" xml:id="pg_77"/>Consulate did not imply
                            recognition of the regime in Rhodesia. Withdrawal is a response to the
                            request of the legal sovereign power in Rhodesia, the United
                            Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The President also has directed an urgent review of all existing
                            regulations implementing <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sanctions
                            against Rhodesia and all pending applications for imports from Rhodesia,
                            especially with respect to imports of chrome ore. This review should
                            examine alternative revisions in these regulations designed to minimize
                            penalties to U.S. firms acting in good faith, while at the same time
                            meeting U.S. legal obligations under our adherence to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sanctions against Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>This review should be conducted by an ad hoc group comprising
                            representatives of the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury and
                            Commerce, the Attorney General, the Director of the Office of Emergency
                            Preparedness, and the Assistant to the President for National Security
                            Affairs. The group should be chaired by the representative of the
                            Secretary of State. The study should be submitted to the President by
                            March 27, 1970.</p>
                        <p>The President has instructed the security classification and very limited
                            distribution of this memorandum be observed scrupulously.</p>

                        <p>South West Africa is an international Territory illegally occupied by
                            South Africa. South Africa became the administering power by virtue of a
                            League of Nations mandate of 1920. Following the demise of the League,
                            International Court of Justice (<gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>)
                            advisory opinions established that the mandate continued in effect, that
                            South Africa could not alter the status of the Territory without <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consent, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> had supervisory authority, and that
                            South Africa was obligated to “promote to the utmost the material and
                            moral well-being and social progress of the inhabitants”. When, in 1966,
                            the International Court of Justice refused to pass on the merits of a
                            contentious proceeding brought by two former League of Nations members
                            to contest South Africa’s administration, the United Nations decided
                                (<gloss target="#t_GA_1">GA</gloss> RES 2145 (XXI), October 27,
                            1966), that (1) because of South Africa’s violations of its obligations
                            and disavowal of the Mandate, the Mandate conferred on it was
                            terminated, (2) that South Africa had no other right to administer the
                            Territory which (3) thenceforth came under the direct responsibility of
                            the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Although South Africa acknowledges that South West Africa has an
                            international character and periodically makes available reports on
                            developments there, it denies that the United Nations is responsible for
                            the Territory and for over two decades has failed to submit to the
                            United Nations the reports and petitions required under the Mandate.
                            Under South African administration, the developed areas, comprising half
                            the Territory, have been reserved to the white minority and apartheid
                            and repressive measures on the South African model have been introduced.
                            South Africa regards the Territory as an important security buffer and
                            economic asset. Short of the use of force, therefore, we do not see any
                            immediate possibility of inducing South Africa to withdraw.</p>
                        <p>Our direct economic and strategic interests in South West Africa are
                            limited. We have approximately $60 million in direct investment,
                            accounted for largely by the Tsumeb mining complex. Several oil and

                            powers supported establishment of the council—whose terms of reference,
                            in our view, were impractical—or accepted membership in it. As a result,
                            the Council is virtually powerless. Nevertheless, the majority of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> members would contend that it is the

                            South West Africa should South Africa withdraw or be forced out.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has supported Security Council resolutions calling on South
                            Africa to withdraw its administration and has made similar
                            representations in bilateral discussions with the South African
                            Government. At the same time, we opposed the setting of arbitrary time
                            limits for withdrawal and have opposed calls for extreme measures such
                            as the use of force or economic sanctions against South Africa. We have
                                <pb n="80" facs="0119" xml:id="pg_80"/>stated in the Security
                            Council that the present situation in South West Africa is not one which
                            can sensibly and humanely be remedied by mandatory sanctions.</p>
                        <p>The 1965 Security Council study concluded that the South African economy,
                            though not immune, would not be “readily susceptible” to the effects of
                            sanctions. Even if the South African economy were less self-sufficient,
                            sanctions are unlikely to be effective without universal support,
                            especially of the major powers. The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>,
                            France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan and a number of
                            other trading nations are actively seeking to expand their shares of the
                            South African market. None of these countries would be likely to support
                            a call for sanctions, and we could expect that evasions would occur.
                            Enforcing sanctions with a blockade, moreover, would involve immense
                            cost and effort, the brunt of which would have to be borne by the
                                U.S.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">1965 Joint Chiefs’ study of naval

                                Mozambique and Angola to make it effective, 3 additional carrier
                                task forces would be needed. [Footnote is in the

                        <p>On January 30, 1970, the U.S. supported a Security Council resolution
                            establishing a subcommittee to prepare recommendations by April 30 on
                            the implementation of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> responsibility
                            for the Territory. The immediate problem posed for the U.S., in view of
                            the pressure being put on us by African leaders to take effective action
                            against South Africa, is how to encourage the subcommittee to take a
                            constructive approach and to avoid inappropriate recommendations.</p>
                        <p>Although we will be credited with steps we have taken in the past, we
                            must expect to be under continuing pressure to do more. We must
                            anticipate that we will be confronted with proposals for sanctions
                            which, if presented in mandatory form, could require the exercise of a
                            veto. We have already abstained on, or opposed, such proposals in the
                            General Assembly. Thus our suggestion of alternatives to sanctions in
                            the Security Council subcommittee could have some positive impact on
                            African opinion, but it is probable that it would only postpone the day
                            when the Western powers are faced with a Security Council call for more
                            extreme measures and possibly the need to cast a veto.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. U.S. Interests and Objectives</p>
                        <p>The U.S. is committed by its national experience, public policy, and
                            international undertakings to support the principles of human rights and
                            self-determination. That commitment was reaffirmed by the President in
                            his recent Report to the Congress “US Foreign Policy for the 1970’s” as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“Clearly there is no question of the United States condoning, or
                            acquiescing in, the racial policies of the white-ruled regimes. For
                            moral as <pb n="81" facs="0120" xml:id="pg_81"/>well as historical
                            reasons, the United States stands firmly for the principles of racial
                            equality and self-determination.”</p>
                        <p>The way in which we deal with the South West African issue will be taken
                            as a measure of our commitment to these principles. In particular, it
                            will affect our credibility on a range of questions pertaining to
                            southern Africa and will help to determine the degree to which the
                            Africans listen to and are influenced by our views.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has an important interest in placing itself in the best position
                            to dissuade or at least delay African insistence on inappropriate
                            coercive measures against South Africa and, if a U.S. veto of such
                            measures should prove unavoidable, to be able to put the best face on
                            it. Pursuit of this interest involves readiness to put forward and
                            support reasonable alternatives, while avoiding a commitment—or even an
                            implication of readiness—to use force.</p>
                        <p>Any choice of options will affect U.S. economic ties in Africa outside
                            the white-controlled areas ($1.7 billion in trade; nearly $2 billion in
                            direct investment) as well as our ties to South Africa ($750 million in
                            trade, $700 million in investment). Other factors involved include
                            strategic interests in both the black and the white-ruled parts of the
                            continent, and <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> space-tracking

                            indeed the probability, that we will be faced with demands for actions
                            on the more extreme part of the spectrum. The international status of
                            the Territory makes it possible for us to take action on South West
                            Africa without necessarily foreclosing options on Rhodesia, the
                            Portuguese Territories, or South Africa contained in the <gloss

                        <p>Underlying the options are three basic assumptions:</p>
                        <p>—that the U.S. regards the present South African administration of the
                            Territory as illegal;</p>
                        <p>—that the U.S. does not support the use of force or measures that would
                            not be effective without the use of force to terminate South Africa’s
                            control over South West Africa;</p>
                        <p>—that South Africa will remain in effective control of the Territory for
                            the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>Within these limits, the options set forth possible U.S. actions in
                            ascending order of U.S. initiative: they begin with continuation of
                            present <pb n="82" facs="0121" xml:id="pg_82"/>restrictions on U.S.
                            activities in South West Africa and work their way up through supporting

                            Africans to shift their pressure onto U.K. and France. Africans are

                        <p>1. The Review Group met at 1445 hours on 10 April under the chairmanship
                            of <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName> to discuss
                            the response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 89: “US Policy
                            for Southwest Africa (Namibia)”.<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2"><ref

                        <p>2. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> opened the
                            meeting by saying that this matter would not be brought before the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> but would be handled by a
                            memorandum to The President.<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3"><ref
                                    target="#d31">Document 31</ref>.</note> It was ascertained that
                            a Presidential decision was needed by 20 April so that the US
                            representatives to the United Nations could be given instructions.</p>
                        <p>3. There was considerable discussion of the three options presented in
                            the response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 89. All present
                            agreed that regardless of the option selected, it is “just a matter of
                            time” until the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> or the US would be
                            forced to veto a resolution on imposing mandatory sanctions on South
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>4. State recommended Option 2—take selective actions in addition to
                            present restrictions to dissociate ourselves from South Africa’s illegal
                            administration of the territory. State would want some flexibility in
                            selecting specific courses of action under Option 2 with the addition of
                            three other courses of action presented under Option 3 if necessary.
                            Specifically, State would want authority to support a proposal in the
                            United Nations for reporting on compliance with the arms embargo on
                            South Africa, to provide funds for refugees from Namibia, and to support
                            referral to the International Court of Justice for an opinion of some
                            legal aspects of South Africa’s administration of Southwest Africa.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>, the Office of the Secretary of
                            Defense, Commerce, and Treasury recommended Option 1—continue present
                            restrictions on US activities in Southwest Africa but avoid any major
                            new action involving the territory. When asked the position of the
                            Agency, I said that it would be inappropriate for <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to take a position on these policy
                            questions. The <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> representative took
                            a similar stand.</p>
                        <p>6. It is interesting to note that Mr. Shakespeare said that the people at
                                <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss> were for Option 2 and that he
                            personally was for Option 1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> pressed Mr. Shakespeare for an agency
                            position, and the response was Option 1.</p>
                        <p>7. All agencies that wish to express their positions are to do so in
                            writing by close of business 13 April for inclusion in the memorandum to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem</p>
                        <p>In 1966, by a resolution we supported, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> General Assembly terminated South Africa’s League of
                            Nations mandate for South West Africa, and declared the Territory to be
                            under <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> responsibility. In January,
                            1970, the Security Council created a subcommittee (of the whole) to
                            study ways of implementing <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> authority.
                            This subcommittee is to report out recommendations by April 30, and
                            these will be debated in the Council in May or June.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Yost needs guidance on positions to take (1) in the drafting
                            of the subcommittee’s recommendations, and (2) in the formal debate.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Issue</p>
                        <p>The Africans will press for stronger measures, (e.g., mandatory
                            sanctions), to assert <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> responsibility
                            for South West Africa. The US needs a posture which limits political
                            damage while we essentially oppose this pressure. The response to <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 89 presents three alternative
                            postures, which range from present policy (Option 1) to two levels of
                            new operational steps dissociating us from South African policy in South
                            West Africa and asserting <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            responsibility (Options 2 and 3).</p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="0131" xml:id="pg_92"/>
                        <p>—Our present policy (<hi rend="italic">Option 1</hi>) recognizes <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> responsibility. We abstained in 1967,
                            however, when the General Assembly created a Council on South West
                            Africa to “administer” it, because we considered the terms of reference
                            (to promulgate laws, etc.) unrealistic. We restrict US diplomatic and
                            attaché visits, port calls and overflights in the Territory. We neither
                            encourage nor discourage US investment there; we allow trade. We do not
                            withhold diplomatic assistance or Export-Import Bank credit guarantees.
                            We support some <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and some private US
                            humanitarian programs for South West African refugees, but have not
                            recently contributed to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Education
                            and Training Fund for these refugees.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Option 2</hi> would (<hi rend="italic">in
                                addition</hi> to the above restrictions) limit US investment in
                            South West Africa by verbally discouraging it, by terminating <gloss
                                target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> guarantees, and by withholding
                            diplomatic assistance. It would encourage other countries to act
                            similarly, and it would support referral of appropriate legal questions
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Option 3</hi> would (<hi rend="italic">in
                                addition</hi> to the steps in Options 1 and 2) consider much
                            stronger measures against US investment and take more conspicuous
                            initiatives in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to strengthen the
                            arms embargo and refugee programs, and to revise the mandate of the
                            General Assembly’s Council on South West Africa (now the Council on
                            Namibia).</p>
                        <p>Our problem in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> is tactical, but
                            there is a basic issue of strategy: Do we gain anything with the
                            Africans by making concessions?</p>
                        <p>—The <hi rend="italic">argument for</hi> new measures is that South
                            Africa’s occupation of the Territory is clearly illegal, and its
                            extension of racial repression there is morally objectionable. Gestures
                            of economic sacrifice would confirm our moral and legal stand against
                            these policies and demonstrate our good faith to the Africans, who might
                            then be more receptive to our counsels of moderation. Since we are
                            prepared to veto any extreme proposals that may arise (e.g., mandatory
                            sanctions), we have no reason to fear escalation of African pressures;
                            demonstrations of our good faith will make it politically easier to veto
                            if we have to.</p>
                        <p>—The <hi rend="italic">argument against</hi> new steps is that there is
                            no reliable bloc of African moderates, and the radicals are
                            unappeasable. The Portuguese Territories, and apartheid in South Africa
                            proper, will be raised in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> very
                            soon, too; US concessions on South West Africa will not dampen, and may
                            even stimulate, pressures to do more on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> these
                            issues. Our sacrifices will gain us little or nothing; we may even be
                            accused of hypocrisy if the sacrifices seem too modest.</p>

                            sanctions; they see a firm stand as the best hope of dampening
                            pressures. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss></hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">Treasury</hi> prefer present policy but do not
                            object strongly to Option 2, provided it is made clear that the US
                            opposes mandatory sanctions. <hi rend="italic">Commerce</hi> believes
                            that any restrictions we impose will simply allow other nations’
                            investors to step in, and it fears setting a precedent which could lead
                            to new restrictions against South Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">State</hi> recommends Option 2. It sees the economic
                            sacrifice involved as slight, but believes these measures will
                            demonstrate more clearly that US policy is not prejudiced by economic
                            interests and will establish a more easily defensible posture from which

                        <p><hi rend="italic">My own view</hi> is that we should have no illusions
                            that limited measures will stop African pressures. Nevertheless, the
                            steps in Option 2 involve only modest sacrifice but will strengthen our
                            position in the (probable) event that we are forced to veto proposals
                            for stronger measures. They would be tokens of our good faith. In the
                            heated <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> debate, remaining rigid would
                                <hi rend="italic">not</hi> successfully “downplay” the issue.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that you focus on the proposed new operational steps
                            individually, rather than on the options. My specific recommendation
                            accompanies each operational step.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Specific Operational Steps</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Option 2</hi> includes the first five steps:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Discourage US investment in South West
                            Africa.</hi></p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Deny <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> credit
                                guarantees for trade with South West Africa.</hi></p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Deny diplomatic protection against claims of a
                                future lawful government of South West Africa to US nationals who
                                invest there on the basis of rights acquired since the 1966 General
                                Assembly resolution.</hi></p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">argument for</hi> these steps is that most agencies
                            believe they will have only slight economic impact, since US investment
                            is high-return and low-risk anyway, and <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1"
                                >EXIM</gloss> facilities are hardly used. Any economic effect these
                            steps did have would give substance to our moral and legal position. By
                            limiting our stake there, they would keep us from becoming more “locked
                            in” and would thus preserve our freedom of action in the future. The <hi
                                rend="italic">argument against</hi> them is that we could be accused
                            of hypocrisy for taking ineffectual steps. (Commerce, on the other hand,
                            sees significant new export possibilities emerging and urges that <gloss
                                target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> facilities not be foreclosed.) Any
                            economic impact they did have would be a sacrifice for which we will not
                            necessarily receive any political benefit. They might be taken as a
                            precedent and stimulate pressures to do the same or more against South
                            Africa and the Portuguese Territories (though the legal issues in South
                            West Africa are unique).</p>

                            economic sacrifice will not be great, and these will strengthen our

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">argument for</hi> this is that if others propose

                            probably only confirm the legal position the US has already taken. The

                            Congress has disapproved contributions.</p>
                        <p>The President intends that the foregoing decisions be regarded as
                            concerned solely with South West Africa. They are not to be regarded as
                            a precedent for application of similar restrictions and policies to
                            South Africa or the Portuguese Territories.</p>
                        <p>The President desires that the United States continue to make clear its
                            opposition to mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa or the
                            Portuguese Territories and to any use of force in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretaries Committee shall report on the implementation of the

                        <p>On April 17, you provided guidance on our policy toward South West Africa
                            (Tab B).<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">Tab B, not attached, is printed as

                            directed include:</p>
                        <p>—We should officially discourage investment by U.S. nationals.</p>
                        <p>—Export-Import Bank credit guarantees and other facilities should no
                            longer be made available for trade with South West Africa.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. nationals who nevertheless invest in South West Africa (on the
                            basis of rights acquired through the South African Government since
                            adoption of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2145) should not receive
                            U.S. assistance in protection of such investments against claims of a
                            future lawful government.</p>
                        <p>—We should encourage other nations to take similar actions, but without
                            exerting pressure on them, either in the United Nations or in our
                            bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Actions Taken or Planned</p>
                        <p>Following are the principal steps taken to implement your guidance:</p>
                        <p>1. Your decisions in the economic area were announced on May 20 by
                            Ambassador Yost in an address to the United Nations Association in New
                            York and by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ND_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs
                            Subcommittee on Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PCH_2">Phillips</persName> stated the
                            U.S. position in accordance with your general guidelines to the Security
                            Council’s subcommittee on South West Africa. In his June 18 statement,
                            the Ambassador issued a general call for governments to discourage trade
                            and investment by their nationals in that territory.</p>
                        <p>3. Additionally, the new policy was communicated to the subcommittee in
                            our reply on June 30 to a subcommittee questionnaire asking all states
                            for information on their activities and the activities of their
                            nationals and companies in South West Africa.</p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_100"/>
                        <p>4. Posts in Africa and embassies in London, Paris and Lisbon advised
                            their host governments and conveyed our hope that they would take
                            similar action to discourage trade and investment by their nationals and
                            companies in South West Africa. Further approaches are contemplated.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PCH_2">Phillips</persName> also
                            expressed support for the Finnish proposal (still under discussion in
                            the Subcommittee) that the following question be put to the
                            International Court of Justice (<gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>)
                            for an advisory opinion:</p>
                        <p>“What are the legal consequences for states, in light of Security Council
                            Resolution 276 (1970), of the continued presence of South Africa in
                            Namibia?”</p>
                        <p>6. The Department of Commerce, the Export-Import Bank, and the Department
                            of State have taken steps to notify the business community (Tab A).<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">Undated, attached but not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>(To date no resolution has been introduced into the Security Council
                            requiring member states to report on application of the arms embargo
                            against South Africa. Hence the point of your guidance dealing with this
                            aspect has not become applicable. The Under Secretaries Committee is
                            conducting a comprehensive review of the embargo.)</p>
                        <p>We believe these actions effectively implement and publicize your
                            guidance on trade and investment in South West Africa. The decisions
                            have been carefully noted in South Africa and have had no harmful
                            effects on our relations with that country. They were favorably received
                            at the United Nations and elsewhere. We will be alert to further
                            opportunities for explaining our policy and encouraging parallel action
                            by others.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> stated that he had

                            decision with respect to arms for South Africa. Knowing that this
                            decision could create problems for the US and having in mind Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName>’ visit to London this
                            weekend <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> wished to give us as much
                            notice as possible.</p>
                        <p>Conservative spokesmen, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1"
                                >Millard</persName> continued, had made clear before and during the
                            recent British election campaign that a Conservative government would
                            resume the sale of arms to South Africa. The decision it has now taken
                            represents a “minimum” move in this direction. It provides that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> will consider arms requests from
                            South Africa for maritime defense related to the protection of sea lanes
                            and in keeping with Simonstown Agreement of 1955. The latter, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> said, requires the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> to provide South Africa with
                            equipment needed for maritime defense. Public announcement of this new
                            policy will be made in the next fortnight or so, but not before the
                            Secretary’s visit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> reiterated the
                            reasoning behind the new Conservative policy and added that the Soviet
                            naval presence in the Indian ocean and the threat of its increase if the
                            Suez Canal were reopened were also factors in the decision. He said the
                            policy decision was made in full cognizance of the interest of
                            Commonwealth and African countries in the question. He added that
                            Commonwealth Governments including African members, he assumed, and some
                            other friendly governments were being informed of the decision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> emphasized that the
                            decision in no way diminished his Government’s opposition to apartheid
                            and that there was no question of arms being supplied for the
                            enforcement of apartheid. Whether the public announcement would
                            reiterate this opposition he could not say.</p>
                        <pb n="102" facs="0141" xml:id="pg_102"/>
                        <p>Noting that the US Government had recently reaffirmed its arms embargo on
                            South Africa, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCR_1">Moore</persName> asked
                            what items were embraced by the term “maritime defense”. The press, he
                            added had made reference to frigates, reconnaissance aircraft and
                            equipment for anti-submarine warfare as likely items. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> replied that he had no
                            specifics and doubted that the public announcement would contain any.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>, he stressed, is not offering
                            armament or equipment but is only stating its willingness to consider
                            well-defined requests. He observed that when the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> voted its resolution on the South African arms embargo
                            in 1963, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> had made note of the
                            right of South Africa to self-defense. The new position is more narrowly
                            defined, the criterion being “maritime defense related to the protection
                            of sea lanes.” It was in fact the minimum <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss> reaction under the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> said his government
                            would be interested in any <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> reaction
                            to the new <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> decision. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCR_1">Moore</persName> said that the subject of arms
                            for South Africa is on the agenda for the Secretary’s talks in London so
                            it will undoubtedly be discussed there. However, he would be in touch
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MGE_1">Millard</persName> if we had any
                            earlier comments to make. He observed that certain African countries,
                            particularly Zambia and Tanzania, would probably have strong feelings on
                            this subject, but the British Government, he assumed, had taken their
                            views into consideration.</p>

                        <p>Subj: Secretary’s Visit: Discussions with Foreign Secretary—Arms to South
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_DSA_1">Sir Alec Douglas-Home</persName> said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UKG_1">UKG</gloss> was bound to operate the
                            Simonstown Agreement. It had been decided, however, that there would be
                            narrower definition of categories of arms to be supplied by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> to South Africa. The definition would be
                            “arms for protection of sea routes”.</p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="0142" xml:id="pg_103"/>
                        <p>2. Sir Alec reviewed the British assessment of the strategic situation.
                            He noted the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean and that the Soviets
                            were active in Aden and in Somalia. The Communist Chinese were involved
                            in construction of a naval base for Tanzania. Given these activities in
                            the area, it was the British view that Simonstown could play an
                            important part in the strategic picture. The <gloss target="#t_UKG_1"
                                >UKG</gloss> had therefore decided that it must carry through the
                            implementation of the Simonstown Agreement. He recognized that there
                            would be “squeals” from African countries and probably difficulties in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>; nevertheless, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> was determined to proceed.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to the Secretary’s question, Sir Alec said that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> was in the process of consulting the
                            Commonwealth. He hoped that none of the governments concerned would
                            leave the Commonwealth, although some were unpredictable, as for example
                            Ceylon under the leadership of Mrs. Bandaranaike. He noted that there
                            might be a particular problem with <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Sir Alec stated that British arms policy with respect to Portugal
                            would not be changed.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary responded that the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            decision would cause problems for the United States. He noted that our
                            relations with black African states were probably better than they had
                            been for some time.</p>
                        <p>6. Sir Alec expressed the hope that the US could say that it understood
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> decision and the reasons for
                            it.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary suggested that there be close consultation and said that
                            we would try to work out something mutually acceptable. In response to
                            his question, Sir Alec said that the British Government would be making
                            an announcement of its policy about July 20. It was agreed that there
                            would be consultation in advance on the announcement to be made by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and on a statement the US would
                            then make.</p>

                        <p>1. Dept Press Spokesman, in answer standing press inquiries, repeated
                            verbatim statement <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> at noon
                            briefing July 22.</p>
                        <p>2. In response press questions after statement, spokesman gave replies
                            summarized below:</p>
                        <p>A. Although we informed by <gloss target="#t_UKG_1">UKG</gloss> in
                            advance, we were not requested associate <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> with this proposed <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            policy. However U.S. in fact disassociating itself from British
                            move.</p>
                        <p>B. Reference in statement to increase in flow of arms includes any
                            increase whatsoever, even in arms solely for defense sea lanes.</p>
                        <p>C. U.S. is interested in freedom of seas and passage, and understands
                                <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> interest in Cape sea routes, but
                            is not able associate with measure resulting in increased arms flow to
                            South Africa.</p>
                        <p>D. Statement is better described as our own policy and attitude than as
                            criticism British policy.</p>
                        <p>E. Our position on resolution on South African arms embargo pending
                            before <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> still under
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>F. No comment on similarity U.S. and Black African Governments positions,
                            or on similarity Wilson government disassociation in 1968 from U.S.
                            bombing Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>G. Statement constitutes reaffirmation our stand on arms embargo; it not
                            intended weaken position we have held since 1963.</p>
                        <p>H. Statement means both that we cannot endorse proposed British action,
                            and that we will not take same action.</p>

                        <p>I. One aspect of U.S. interest this question stems from U.N. resolution

                        <p>The options presented in the Under Secretaries Report go beyond your
                            instruction. They range from no revision at all of our current
                            regulations, to revisions which would, in effect, break the embargo and
                            put us in violation of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security
                            Council Resolutions.<note n="4" xml:id="d37fn4">See <ref target="#d8fn5"

                            is consistent with your instruction. This memorandum, <pb n="106"
                                facs="0145" xml:id="pg_106"/>therefore, addresses itself primarily
                            to steps that we might take without reneging on our international
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>However, I should call to your attention that the Secretary of State
                            recommends that there be no change whatsoever in our current
                            implementation of the embargo. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName> argues that we are legally bound to the letter of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolution (which makes no
                            provision for relief in hardship cases). He further argues that any
                            relaxation at all of our present procedures would “seriously undermine
                            the genuine good will toward your administration . . . of many black
                            African leaders.” Finally, the Secretary asserts that <hi rend="italic"
                                >any</hi> change in our procedures might lead to a general collapse
                            of the embargo, and our being charged with the responsibility therefor.
                            The Secretary therefore recommends to you that we make a more vigorous
                            effort in the United Nations to ensure compliance by other countries
                            with the embargo and, pending the result of those efforts, adhere
                            strictly to our present procedures. This, of course, means that we would

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH_1">Stans</persName>, on the other
                            hand, is frankly opposed to the embargo on chrome imports from Rhodesia.
                            He argues that it leaves us excessively dependent on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> for chrome, and enables the Soviets
                            to manipulate prices to the disadvantage of U.S. purchasers. Although
                            not pressing at this time for open abrogation of the embargo, he states
                            that the approval of import licenses to both Union Carbide and Foote
                            Mineral are “necessary to relieve our dependence on the Soviet Union for
                            the long term availability of” chrome. In the Carbide case, the money
                            was paid before our embargo went into effect, and with full knowledge of
                            it. A license for Foote would be hard to portray as anything but an open
                            violation of the embargo. In addition, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMH_1">Stans</persName>’ arguments lose some of their
                            force from the following facts: (1) even before the embargo, we were
                            buying as much chrome from Russia as from Rhodesia, (2) the Foote import
                            would cover less than 7 percent of one year’s U.S. needs. It would
                            therefore hardly affect our dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> for about half of our current chrome needs and would
                            have no effect on the “long term” situation.</p>
                        <p>I do not agree with either Secretary’s views. Neither does Treasury or
                            Defense. This is an extremely complex and multi-faceted issue, but what
                            follows is an earnest attempt to reduce it to the minimal essentials
                            which you should know before making a decision.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Legal Situation</p>
                        <p>State and Justice disagree. State argues that our compliance with the
                            letter of the Security Council Resolutions is mandatory and permits <pb
                                n="107" facs="0146" xml:id="pg_107"/>of no discretion in its
                            implementation. State also argues that the intervening three years of
                            enforcement have wiped out whatever justification there might have been
                            for hardship exceptions in the early stages of the embargo.</p>
                        <p>This matter was personally reviewed by the Attorney General and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRG_1">Kleindienst</persName> who find the
                            State Department’s legal argument without merit. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRG_1">Kleindienst</persName> points out that the White
                            House announcement of the Rhodesia sanctions said that “provision will
                            be made . . . to deal with cases of undue hardship arising from
                            transactions commenced before the date of the order.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRG_1">Kleindienst</persName> further points out that
                            the Executive Order itself authorized the issuance of import licenses,
                            and that this authorization would hardly have been granted if it had
                            been the intent to permit <hi rend="italic">no</hi> exceptions to the
                            embargo. Finally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRG_1"
                                >Kleindienst</persName> points out that licenses have been issued in
                            hardship cases and that no protest was received from the United Nations
                            or any member countries because they understood, as a practical matter,
                            that the implementation of the Security Council Resolution would
                            necessarily involve some hardship exceptions. Justice holds the State
                            argument on timing to be irrelevant in the case of Union Carbide, which
                            has been pending since the embargo went into effect.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Security Aspects</p>
                        <p>An adequate supply of chromite ore is a strategic necessity. However, as
                            of now, our supplies are adequate. All agencies are agreed on that
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>Our current consumption needs are met by imports from Russia, Turkey and
                            South Africa, and sales from the surplus in our chromite stockpile.
                            Should the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cut off sales to us of
                            chromite ore or if Rhodesian ore were to continue to be unavailable for
                            a number of years, we might eventually experience a shortage. There is,
                            however, no indication whatever that the Soviet Union is contemplating
                            such a move; and adjustments to the long-range effect of the Rhodesian
                            embargo is something that can be faced, if and when it becomes a
                            problem. We should, however, keep a continuing watch on the chromite
                            supply situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Economic Aspects</p>
                        <p>The sanctions have helped our tobacco industry by enabling us to replace
                            Rhodesian exports to the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>. However the
                            Rhodesian sanctions do put an economic burden on US chrome purchasers.
                            Chrome prices have risen sharply since 1966. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> (a major source of our chromite both
                            before and after sanctions) has been able to tie the purchase of lower
                            grade ore to the high grade ore we require. Finally, US and <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> firms are disadvantaged by the fact that
                            France, Italy, West Germany, Switzerland and Japan are less careful than

                        <p>The actual issue for decision, therefore, is not whether to adhere to the
                            embargo but rather what relief can be given within the terms of the
                            embargo to those firms which claim undue hardship. These cases fall into
                            two categories:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Union Carbide</hi>. Carbide claims to have paid for
                            150,000 tons of chrome ore after the Security Council Resolution but <hi
                                rend="italic">before</hi> the first Executive Order was issued
                            prohibiting the Rhodesian imports.<note n="8" xml:id="d37fn8">Executive
                                Order 11322, January 5, 1967.</note> The White House announcement of
                            the Executive Order imposing the embargo stated that provision would be
                            made for “cases of undue hardship arising from transactions commenced
                            before the date” of the Executive Order. The Carbide case seems to fit
                            squarely in that category. Moreover, the Treasury Department announced
                            in March of 1967 that licenses for import would in general be issued
                            where payment had been made prior to January 5, 1967. Again, the Union
                            Carbide case fits.</p>
                        <p>Carbide is the only case of an American firm which <hi rend="italic"

                            should be granted, and would be consistent with our international
                            obligations. State disagrees.</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Sale of American Owned Assets in Rhodesia.</hi>
                            Some American firms, including Foote Mineral and Universal Leaf Tobacco,
                            have said that if they are unable to import Rhodesian commodities owned
                            by their Rhodesian subsidiaries, they would like to sell their Rhodesian
                            assets. At the present time, our regulations make such sales difficult.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution,
                            however, does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> explicitly prohibit the sale of
                            assets. We could, therefore, merely by reinterpreting our own
                            regulations, permit the sale of American owned Rhodesian assets.
                            Treasury, Commerce and <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> favor such
                            action. State opposes it, on the grounds that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Resolutions implicitly prohibit such
                            sales.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Political Pressure Aspects</p>
                        <p>Mr. L.G. Bliss of Foote Mineral has been very active in opposing the
                            embargo of imports from Rhodesia. He has asked for a chrome import
                            license under circumstances which would constitute a clear violation of
                            the Security Council Resolutions and the existing Executive Orders. He
                            has told <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> that if he is not given
                            the license he will attempt to prevent Congressional approval of further
                            sales from our chrome stockpile.</p>
                        <p>I find it difficult to believe that Mr. Bliss will deliver on his threat.
                            First, the effect of his action would be to increase the already high
                            price of chrome, a subject upon which Mr. Bliss is already considerably
                            exercised. Second, <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> believes the two
                            major firms in the chrome producing field, Union Carbide and AIRCO, can
                            be persuaded to oppose Mr. Bliss’s move. This should be particularly
                            true if you grant the recommended approval of a hardship exception for
                            Union Carbide. Third, if you approve the recommended sale of American
                            owned assets in Rhodesia, this will open an avenue of relief to Mr.
                            Bliss, which may dissuade him from pushing his application for an import
                            license to such extremes. <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> believes
                            Mr. Bliss might be able to deliver on his threat this session, but
                            agrees that he would find it difficult to do so if you approve the
                            recommendations regarding Carbide and the sale of U.S. assets in
                            Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the granting of an import license to Foote Mineral would,
                            as stated above, be a clear violation of the Security Council
                            Resolution, and would involve foreign policy costs which transcend the
                            cost involved in a Congressional refusal to sanction additional sales
                            from the chromite stockpile surplus. (Of the $750 million you hope to
                            realize from <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> ’71 stockpile sales,
                                <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> plans to get $30 million from
                            chrome sales.)</p>
                        <p>The facts of the Foote application are as follows: Foote sent money into
                            Rhodesia <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the date of the first Executive
                            Order prohibiting <pb n="110" facs="0149" xml:id="pg_110"/>imports, and
                            with the full knowledge that no ore produced as a result could be
                            licensed for import to the United States. The ostensible purpose of the
                            transaction at the time was to prevent the flooding of a Foote-owned
                            mine in Rhodesia. State and Treasury oppose the granting of a license to
                            Foote. Commerce favors granting the license. <gloss target="#t_OEP_1"
                                >OEP</gloss> defers to State and Treasury on the question of
                            legality, but is worried about Bliss’s threat to its plans to sell
                            chromite from the stockpile.</p>
                        <p>Corning Glass previously had a troublesome problem stemming from its
                            reliance on an ore available only from Rhodesia. However, a domestic
                            substitute has been developed and Corning’s problem is resolved. There
                            are applications from Metallurg to import chrome, from Dibrell to import
                            tobacco and from American Asbestos to import high grade asbestos. None
                            of these firms, however, have paid any money, and they do not,
                            therefore, fall within the hardship category. Asbestos has alternative
                            sources of supply. Granting import licenses to any of these firms would
                            clearly be a violation of the Security Council Resolutions and would be
                            inconsistent with existing Executive Orders.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summation</p>
                        <p>If the facts are as presented by Union Carbide, this seems a clear case
                            of “undue hardship”. Their purchase of chromite ore in Rhodesia was
                            legal at the time the funds were transferred. The granting of a license
                            to Carbide would be consistent with current U.S. regulations, and
                            although it might be subjected to criticism, it could not fairly be
                            characterized as a break in the U.S. implementation of the embargo. I
                            believe a license should be granted to Union Carbide.</p>
                        <p>In view of your desire to avoid undue hardship on American firms, I see
                            no reason why we should, in our implementation of the sanctions, go
                            beyond the steps required by the Security Council Resolution. I
                            therefore think we should permit the sale of American owned assets in
                            Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>To be blunt about it, the Foote Mineral application to import chromite
                            ore is an exercise in embargo busting. The grant of a license to Foote
                            could not plausibly be defended as anything other than a fundamental
                            change in the U.S. embargo of Rhodesian imports and a U.S. refusal to
                            comply with the Security Council Resolutions. Moreover, if you approve
                            the sale of American owned assets in Rhodesia, this will open to Foote
                            Mineral an avenue of relief.</p>
                        <p>I am also attracted to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1"
                                >Rogers</persName>’ suggestion that we attempt to lessen the
                            competitive disadvantages of U.S. firms by tightening the enforcement of
                            the embargo by the other major industrial nations.</p>

                                cause for concern was that the resolution went well beyond the sale
                                of military equipment to a general embargo on sales to the South
                                African Defense Forces, hampering the U.S. Government’s ability to
                                honor pre-embargo contracts to supply non-lethal spare parts.

                            US abstention in no way implies change in US position with respect to
                            apartheid or connotes any weakening in our support of existing <gloss

                            our own embargo was reaffirmed by the Administration in March this year
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP_1">Rogers</persName> noted this
                            reaffirmation as late as July 11 during his London visit. Quotation from
                            US statement apropos here. Quote And an official spokesman of Department
                            of State only yesterday reaffirmed that the US supports the Council’s
                            resolution on the sale of arms to South Africa and indicated that our
                            government would not be able to associate itself with any measures which
                            might result in an increase in the flow of arms to South Africa.

                        <p>4. Referring to statements by preceding speakers about military equipment
                            we have supplied to South Africa over past few years, US representative
                            said deliveries currently being made consist entirely of spare parts and
                            stem from contracts entered into prior to effective date of US embargo,
                            i.e., December 31, 1963. Deliveries of major items of military equipment
                            under these contracts have long since been completed. However, it is
                            basic tenet of US trade policy that valid contracts, such as those for
                            supply of spare parts, should be honored.</p>
                        <p>5. US would not go so far as to characterize situation in South Africa as
                            potential threat to international peace and security. In our view, such
                            characterization goes beyond facts of situation and, therefore, would be
                            inappropriate. In particular, proposals contained in operative <pb

                            divide the Council, fail to fulfill their intended purpose and thus

                            to license import of Rhodesian goods by any firm which entered into a
                            transaction after the effective date of the Executive Order prohibiting
                            such imports. The Presi<pb n="114" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_114"/>dent has
                            also directed that the Department of State initiate forthwith an active
                            effort—in concert with the United Kingdom—to insure better compliance by
                            other industrial nations with the Rhodesian embargo. In this regard, the
                            President wishes that particular attention be paid to more careful
                            scrutiny of nominally non-Rhodesian chrome imports.</p>
                        <p>In the interest of reducing undue hardship on American firms arising from
                            our implementation of the embargo, the President has decided that:</p>
                        <p>1. Contingent upon confirmation by the Treasury Department that the facts
                            are as stated by Union Carbide, a “hardship exception” license should be
                            granted to Union Carbide for the importation of the 150,000 tons of
                            Rhodesian chromite ore for which it had paid prior to the effective date
                            of the Executive Order prohibiting such imports.</p>
                        <p>2. U.S. firms with assets in Rhodesia will be permitted to sell those
                            assets to any buyer.</p>
                        <p>3. The Treasury Department will insure that all U.S. firms affected by
                            the Rhodesian sanctions or by Rhodesian currency restrictions are aware
                            of all tax relief provisions available to them under existing United
                            States laws and regulations.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretaries Committee will periodically review the domestic and
                            international supply situation on chrome, and call forthwith to the
                            President’s attention any change which threatens our strategic needs for
                            this commodity. For this purpose, representatives of the Secretary of
                            Commerce and the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness shall
                            be members of the Committee.</p>

                            the United States will continue to adhere to the pertinent 1963 Security
                            Council Resolutions and will, on appropriate occasions, affirm its
                            intention so to do.</p>
                        <p>The President is concerned with the delays that have attended the
                            handling of applications for “gray area” export licenses. The President
                            has therefore directed that such applications in future will be handled
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Non-lethal dual-use items which are <hi rend="italic">preponderantly
                                employed for civilian use</hi> will be licensed to either civilian
                            or military buyers. Such items will generally not be manufactured to
                            military specifications, and will not have any direct and clear
                            application in combat, or to internal security operations. Items on our
                            “Munitions List” are automatically excluded from this category.</p>
                        <p>2. Non-lethal dual-use items which are <hi rend="italic">preponderantly
                                used by military forces</hi>, but which do not have a clear and
                            direct application to combat or to internal security operations, will be
                            licensed for sale to civilian purchasers for civilian use, and may be
                            licensed to military buyers upon the recommendation of the Department of
                            Commerce and <pb n="116" facs="0155" xml:id="pg_116"/>with the
                            concurrence of the Department of State. Such items will generally be
                            built to military specifications.</p>
                        <p>3. Whether preponderantly employed for civilian or military use, dual-use
                            items <hi rend="italic">with a clear and direct application to combat or
                                to internal security operations</hi> (including aircraft suitable
                            for troop transport), will not be licensed to military buyers. Such
                            items may be licensed for sale to civilian purchasers for civilian use,
                            only upon the recommendation of the Department of Commerce and with the
                            concurrence of the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the above guidelines, the President has directed
                            that:</p>
                        <p>1. Licenses be issued for the sale of Lear jets to the South African
                            Defense Forces.</p>
                        <p>2. Licenses be issued for the sale of Cessna dual-engine 401s and 402s to
                            the South African Defense Forces.</p>
                        <p>3. Licenses will not be issued for the sale of Cessna single-engine
                            180/185s to the South African Defense Forces.</p>
                        <p>4. Licenses will not be issued for the sale of Lockheed Orion P–3Cs to
                            the South African Defense Forces.</p>
                        <p>5. Licenses will not be issued for the sale of L–100 transport aircraft
                            to the South African Defense Forces.</p>
                        <p>The President wishes special care taken to avoid these decisions being
                            related to the current consideration being given by the Government of
                            the United Kingdom to the sale of maritime defense equipment to South
                            Africa. The President has therefore directed that the security
                            classification of this document be scrupulously observed. The President
                            has also directed that his Special Assistant for National Security
                            Affairs and the Chairman of the Under Secretaries Committee together
                            determine and agree upon the procedures for informing members of
                            Congress, interested American companies, and the South African and
                            Portuguese governments of the decisions reflected herein.</p>

                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>2. Rhodesia is clearly British problem and responsibility. We also
                            recognize there many roadblocks in way of reaching acceptable accord
                            with Salisbury. But as we have been and are involved with the problem,
                            we would like to share with <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> some
                            reflections on possible British initiatives this area:</p>
                        <p>3. As none of Rhodesia’s neighbors appears to feel comfortable with
                            present situation, might there be virtue in <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> seeking their views (principally in Lisbon, Lusaka and
                            Pretoria) before entering again into direct negotiations with Smith with
                            the attendant full glare of public attention and African criticism.
                            While Zambians and South Africans might not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1"
                                >rpt</gloss> not find it possible publicly to acclaim an acceptable
                            compromise settlement, privately they and the Portuguese might have
                            suggestions on ways to move the issue off dead center toward solution
                            with which they could live. (<hi rend="italic">FYI</hi>. We are not
                                <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> not optimistic that another
                            direct approach to Salisbury will be any more productive than the
                            earlier “Tiger” or “Fearless” negotiations unless other affected players
                            can be brought into act in some meaningful and constructive way. We also
                            concerned that should new talks fail, <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> might tend to ease sanctions enforcement, leaving

                        <p>a. Although we have no way gauging probable Portuguese reaction, it

                        <p>b. It also seems to us that both Zambians and South Africans—Zambia

                            related to its “outward” foreign policy objectives—would be happy to see

                        </opener>
                        <p>For some time there has been a need to clarify certain aspects of United
                            States relations with the South African military establishment. How to
                            deal with South African requests for unclassified training films and
                            military correspondence courses and with the question of high-ranking
                            military visits has been a nagging problem for both our Departments for
                            several years.</p>
                        <p>None of these issues was definitively dealt with in recent southern
                            Africa studies submitted to the National Security Council (<gloss
                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>) or the subsequent White House policy
                                directives,<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">For study and decision

                        <p>Therefore, I am proposing a set of guidelines, a copy of which is
                            enclosed, for handling these questions. I hope these can become agreed
                            State/Defense policy. Assuming both Departments reach agreement on the
                            guidelines, I propose we then inform the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"

                            and high-level official visits, e.g. Brigadier General, etc., will not
                            be approved in either direction.</p>
                        <p>2. Participation of South African officers of any level in military
                            courses or conferences in the US will not normally be approved when the
                            sponsor is a branch of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Exceptions can be made in special circumstances, e.g. where the visit
                            or participation in a course or conference (a) would not be conspicuous;
                            (b) would not contribute directly to South Africa’s military capacity
                            and (c) would offer some special advantage in the pursuit of US
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>4. Decisions in such cases will be taken by the Departments of State and

                            to discourage nonofficial travel by high-ranking military personnel
                            between the two countries if it appears that such travel would cause us

                        <p>Thank you for your letter of November 16.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">In
                                his November 16, 1970, letter to <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                                expressed concerns about southern Africa and U.S. involvement in the
                                region. (Ibid., POL 15–1 ZAMBIA)</note> I was pleased to receive
                            your views and appreciated the candid and cooperative spirit in which
                            you expressed them.</p>
                        <p>We share your concern regarding the racial problems in the southern part
                            of Africa. Racial issues are among the most important facing the world
                            today. Our own unalterable opposition to apartheid and racial injustice
                            wherever it may occur, and our support of the right to
                            self-determination, are abundantly clear. The United States will not
                            cease to work for the attainment of the principles of human justice and
                            equality until these goals have been achieved.</p>
                        <p>In our continuing consideration of these problems, I welcome the
                            thoughtful views on the Indian Ocean and southern Africa which you have
                            expressed in your letter and on other occasions. They will receive our
                            careful attention. As you suggest, the general security of the Indian
                            Ocean area is a matter of concern to many nations. The policy which each
                            nation adopts is understandably based on its assessment of its own
                            national interests. The United States would be concerned at any
                            dominance of the area which would restrict the free passage of ships and
                            flow of commerce so essential to all nations.</p>
                        <p>Your wide-ranging responsibilities as Chairman of the Non-Aligned
                            Conference give you a special interest in the views of other governments
                            on various world issues. Ambassador Troxel will continue to be kept
                            fully apprised of our views on all major issues and is ready to discuss
                            them with you from time to time as may be convenient.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to a continuing close and friendly association with
                            Zambia.</p>

                        <p>We intend to deal in the United States statement with five issues which
                            were developed by the written pleadings.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Jurisdiction.</hi> South Africa argues that the request
                            for the advisory opinion is not properly before the Court because two
                            Permanent Members of the Security Council abstained on the resolution
                            requesting the opinion.<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">Security Council
                                Resolution 284, July 29, 1970.</note> The consistent practice of the
                            Security Council has been to regard as adopted resolutions which receive
                            the required number of affirmative votes despite the voluntary
                            abstention of one or more of the Permanent Members of the Council. We
                            will argue that the abstentions of the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R.
                            do not affect the validity of the relevant resolution.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Discretion.</hi> Under its Statute the Court is not
                            required to give an advisory opinion even though it has jurisdiction to
                            do so. We shall argue that it should give an opinion in this case since
                            failure to do so would be inconsistent with its prior jurisprudence
                            relating to the exercise of discretion in advisory cases.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General Assembly Resolution 2145.</hi> This is the 1966
                            resolution which terminated South Africa’s rights under the Mandate. The
                            United States <pb n="123" facs="0162" xml:id="pg_123"/>voted for that
                            resolution. Several states challenged its validity in their written
                            statements. We shall argue that the resolution was valid.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Security Council Resolutions and Their Effects.</hi>
                            General Assembly Resolution 2145 was followed by a series of Security
                            Council resolutions. It has been argued that some of those resolutions
                            were adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter and thus bind states. We
                            will deny that the Security Council acted under Chapter VII. We shall
                            also discuss the effects of those resolutions. In that regard we shall
                            argue against a submission by another participant which, if accepted,
                            would affect private rights, including the right to pass title to goods
                            in or from Namibia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">De Novo Examination of the Facts.</hi> The South
                            African written statement argues that the General Assembly did not
                            properly apply its mind to the facts relating to the administration of
                            Namibia. The statement contains considerable additional information on
                            current conditions there and offers to supply still further information.
                            We would oppose de novo examination of the facts.</p>
                        <p>We plan to draw heavily in our argumentation on the written statement
                            submitted earlier by the United States to the Court.</p>

                                Memorandum</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>American firms doing business in South Africa are coming under increasing
                            criticism from U.S. domestic and black African opinion, inter alia on
                            the grounds that their presence in the Republic gives moral <pb n="124"
                                facs="0163" xml:id="pg_124"/>support to the unpalatable racial
                            policies of the South African Government. We believe that by bettering
                            the conditions of employment of non-whites in their South African
                            plants, American businesses can quietly demonstrate to the contrary that
                            in one important way they are helping to improve social conditions in
                            the Republic in line with the non-discriminatory objectives they support
                            at home.</p>
                        <p>Over the past year we have developed a number of suggestions that
                            American firms might consider in examining ways to improve their
                            employment, wage and benefit arrangements for non-white South African
                            employees and more generally to support improvements in the situation of
                            all non-white South Africans. We have considered personnel policies
                            followed in the US, the practices of South African, American and other
                            firms in South Africa, and the pertinent South African legislation. We
                            have also discussed the problem with a few selected private individuals,
                            such as William Beatty, a Vice President of Chase Manhattan, George
                            Lindsay of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights under Law, Tom Wyman
                            of Polaroid, and Professor John Dugard of the University of the
                            Witwatersrand.</p>
                        <p>We have found that as a general rule American companies are not in the
                            forefront as regards personnel practices, some falling below common
                            standards, and that there is considerable room for improvements which
                            are legally acceptable and, at least in many cases, economically
                            supportable. Our soundings have indicated that the home offices of many
                            of the more than 300 US firms involved in South Africa are ignorant of
                            the realities of the situation there, and we have good evidence that
                            they would welcome additional information and ideas.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that ordinarily any changes in the employment and other
                            personnel practices of American firms in South Africa must be initiated
                            by their headquarters in the U.S. With rare exceptions managers of
                            American affiliates in South Africa, whether of American, South African
                            or other nationality, are not prepared to act on such matters without
                            explicit guidance from their home offices.</p>
                        <p>Although a moral issue of worldwide concern is involved, we believe we
                            can best approach American companies on this problem quietly, and from
                            the viewpoint of the firm’s self-interest, as seen within South Africa,
                            in the rest of Africa, and in the United States. In light of the
                            increasing importance to U.S. business interests of significant labor,
                            civil rights, and consumer groups in the U.S., enlightened self-interest
                            necessarily includes what management, consumers, and stockholders of
                            American business accept as consistent with the principle of racial
                            equality. At the present time, any action we or the companies take
                            should avoid the impression of a concerted attack on the racial system
                            as such, for that could stimulate strong South African reaction and
                            damage U.S. business interests.</p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="0164" xml:id="pg_125"/>
                        <p>While some of the business representatives with whom we have talked would
                            like the State Department to take the lead in this matter, we consider
                            it essential for American companies to be out in front. Some,
                            particularly Polaroid, are already there. Others, such as Morgan
                            Guaranty, which has quietly stopped lending to any South African
                            entities (Chase International never has) and will consider loans only to
                            American firms for trade purposes, are limiting their ties to South
                            Africa. Still others, as exemplified by inquiries we have had from
                            Dupont and AMAX, and by the interest a number of firms have shown in the
                            Polaroid program, are worried about the South African situation and
                            looking for an appropriate course of action.</p>
                        <p>Attached is a paper outlining some of the constructive personnel policies
                            which can be adopted within the present South African legal
                                framework.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">The attachment, “Apartheid and
                                U.S. Firms in South Africa,” provides an overview of the problems
                                faced by American companies and their subsidiaries operating in
                                South Africa, and offers suggestions for improving the lives and
                                working conditions of non-whites without drawing undue attention
                                from the South African Government.</note></p>
                        <p>We propose to continue our soundings and to work quietly with a few key
                            individuals in businesses, banks and the legal profession, raising the
                            kinds of questions discussed in the attached paper and seeking to
                            encourage further inquiry and trial efforts in the area.</p>
                        <p>We do not at this time plan or propose any formal US Government action in
                            this area. Should this seem desirable after our soundings, we will seek
                            your formal approval.</p>

                            of Justice (<gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>) in conducting a

                            of a plebiscite if one were held.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">South Africa Versus <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</hi> The issue of South-West Africa has been a primary
                            and perennial concern of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> since
                            the establishment of the world body. In 1966 the General Assembly
                            decided, by Resolution 2145, that South Africa had forfeited its right
                            to administer South-West under its 1920 League of Nations mandate, and
                            that the territory was thenceforth a direct responsibility of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> as the League’s successor. South Africa
                            claimed that Resolution 2145 was illegal, and has pertinaciously
                            asserted that its stewardship of the territory is both legal and in the
                            best interests of the inhabitants. The matter is at an impasse, leaving
                            South Africa with the advantage because it exerts de facto control over
                            South-West, and because effective <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            measures to oust it are not in prospect.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Terms of the Offer.</hi> South Africa made its
                            plebiscite offer in connection with current deliberations at The Hague
                            on a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> request for an <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> advisory opinion on the “legal
                            consequences for states” of South Africa’s continued presence in
                            South-West. The South Africans framed their offer in these terms: the
                            basis of Resolution 2145 was that South Africa had failed to fulfill its
                            obligations under the mandate. However (according to South Africa) the
                            allegations on which the resolution relied are not proved, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> still “uncritically” accepts that
                            South African practices and policies in the territory oppress the
                            inhabitants and deny them the right of self-determination. To refute
                            such allegations, South Africa will seek to put them to “the most
                            fundamental test of all: that of the express will of the inhabitants . .
                            . by way of a plebiscite <pb n="127" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_127"/>. . .
                            to determine whether it is the wish of the inhabitants that the
                            territory should continue to be administered by the South African
                            government or should henceforth be administered by the United Nations”.
                            South Africa and the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> would jointly
                            supervise the plebiscite.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Undermining Resolution 2145.</hi> The question
                            presented to the court for an advisory opinion was carefully framed to
                            assume the validity of Resolution 2145; most participants agree,
                            nevertheless, that the court may examine this question. South Africa is
                            trying to use this non-binding proceeding to call into question the
                            competence of the General Assembly to pass such a resolution, the
                            validity of the resolution itself, and, further, to reopen and argue the
                            allegations of fact on which Resolution 2145 was “uncritically”
                            based.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Minimum Risk for South Africa.</hi> While South Africa
                            is implying that a plebiscite would be an exercise in
                            self-determination, it has not committed itself to act in accordance
                            with the results of the vote. South Africa is also limiting the scope of
                            the question by omitting reference to a vote on the alternative of
                            independence for the territory. Finally, South Africa is in a position
                            to reject a plebiscite if it finds proposals for the modalities of
                            campaigning and voting unacceptable.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative for the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                    >ICJ</gloss>.</hi> In considering the plebiscite proposal, which
                            is one aspect of South Africa’s comprehensive approach to the case, it
                            is questionable that the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> could
                            directly participate in setting up or supervising a plebiscite.
                            Additionally, the court would probably want to assure itself that it
                            would not be usurping functions of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>’s political organs. It is much more likely that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> will refer the offer—if it
                            deals with it at all—directly to a political organ of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. If the court thus finesses the
                            plebiscite, South Africa may decline further discussion of it on grounds
                            that it is sub judice, that it was made only to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>, and that in any case the political
                            organs of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> have already
                            demonstrated their unwillingness to accept the facts of South African
                            administration and are not interested in self-determination for the
                            people of the territory. Thus, the South Africans expect in any event to
                            make political gains at small risk.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">A Hope of Self-Determination</hi>. A plebiscite
                            arrangement which would give the hope of genuine self-determination
                            would require South Africa to commit itself to act on the vote, to allow
                            ample time for campaigning, to allow freedom for all the inhabitants
                            (including exiles) to campaign, and to immunize those engaged in
                            electioneering from harassment before or after the vote. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for its part might commit itself (e.g.,
                            by resolution), if it won the plebiscite, to a timetable for
                            independence and to substantial assistance programs. The political
                            obstacles to formulating such an agreement are formidable, but failure
                            to deal with the plebiscite matter would leave the propaganda field to
                            South Africa. Already, Dawid de Villiers, leader of South Africa’s legal
                                <pb n="128" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_128"/>team at The Hague, has said
                            that he would find it incomprehensible that South Africa’s critics
                            should spurn the offer. He added that while he could not commit South
                            Africa to accept the outcome of a negative vote, this would be a
                            “tremendous setback to the stance of the South African government”.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Will It Come to a Vote?</hi> We doubt that the South
                            African government expects that its offer will be accepted, and we
                            believe the South Africans would be content with the political gains
                            inherent in the offer itself. But they also believe that they would not
                            be taking much of a political risk, should the matter come to a vote
                            under mutually agreed conditions.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">How Would a Vote Go?</hi> South-West Africa has a
                            population (according to 1966 estimates) of 610,000. By far the largest
                            group are the 270,000 Ovambos grouped along the northern border.
                            Ovamboland, South-West Africa’s only functioning Bantu “homeland,” has
                            received a very limited measure of local self-government, and South
                            Africa has devoted substantial resources to the improvement of its
                            infrastructure, social facilities, and agriculture. At the same time,
                            South Africa has entrenched a political structure controlled by
                            government-paid chiefs and has emasculated political opposition through
                            police presence and application of South Africa’s notorious Terrorism
                            Act. Given these carrot-and-stick conditions, plus South African
                            willingness to offer favors to cooperative Ovambos, a majority of the
                            Ovambos would probably vote for continued association with South Africa
                            rather than the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Virtually all of the 96,000 whites, who form the second largest group in
                            the territory, would also vote for association with South Africa; the
                            Ovambos and whites together comprise 60 percent of the population. Among
                            the other inhabitants, only the Hereros and the Rehoboth Basters are
                            presently in outright opposition to South African rule—but this does not
                            necessarily mean they would prefer <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>Much would depend on the manner in which the plebiscite was organized and
                            conducted; in particular, how much time would be allowed to educate the
                            people to the issues involved and how much free discussion permitted.
                            Officials of the South-West Africa Peoples Organization (<gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>) have expressed full confidence
                            that, given freedom for 9–12 months to work within the territory and
                            explain the issues to the people, the result would favor the United
                            Nations. This very possibility makes it most unlikely that South Africa
                            would permit such a campaign.</p>

                            because it involves a fundamental issue relating to our approach to that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>We have made it clear by our declarations and our actions that we desire
                            a policy of communication with South Africa. At almost the same time
                            that we have been stressing this theme, the South Africans have expelled
                            a number of American citizens engaged in religious and humanitarian work
                            in that country. These have brought Congressional inquiries and letters
                            from significant church groups in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Prior to his departure from South Africa, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJ_2">Hurd</persName> lodged an official protest over
                            the manner of the expulsions. The South African Foreign Minister’s
                            response reflected some embarrassment and suggested that the action may
                            have been taken by Interior and Police without wider consultations.</p>
                        <p>We are proposing that, upon his return from consultation, Ambassador

                            emphasizing the problems such actions create in our relations with South

                            after indicating to them, as he did, that he would discuss the matter
                            here might suggest to the South Africans that we consider it, after all,
                            of little importance;</p>
                        <p>(b) a response to their obvious desire for better relations requires
                            occasional frank discussion of some of the problems we face; and</p>
                        <p>(c) such an approach might well strengthen the hands of the Foreign
                            Ministry in dealing with other government agencies in future actions
                            affecting us.</p>

                            instructions as attached. However, after our first discussion with him,

                            with what he understands to be the President’s view on our relations
                            with South Africa. He describes this as one which maintains our official
                            posture of abhorrence for the system but avoids having the United States
                            Government involved in direct pressure against the system, leaving this
                            to private groups involved (as in the Polaroid case.)</p>
                        <p>In our view our official pronouncements on South Africa will not have
                            credibility with that government if we do not raise with them in frank
                            terms matters bearing on the total relationship of our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that the approach we have suggested is not only
                            appropriate but necessary for the kind of relationship we seek.</p>

                        <p>2. US has consistently taken position that improved atmosphere between
                            South Africa and black Africa is desirable from standpoint stability and
                            peace of continent. It welcomes moves in this direction as indicated by

                            South African press report which I have indicates Ambassador had already
                            accepted invitation to attend opening of Malan Opera House in Cape Town.
                            Fact that he later arranged to be out of the country irrelevant. Do not
                            agree that policy cannot be devised which will permit our mission
                            representatives to visit segregated facilities if the conduct of
                            official business is necessary in the strictest sense. Any use of
                            facilities outside of this narrow context represents complicity with
                            apartheid policy. We cannot say that we deplore the degradation of
                            apartheid in such facilities and then turn around and use said
                            facilities without admitting hypocrisy, particularly if such use is
                            related to unofficial business. Use of American-controlled facilities on
                            a nonsegregated basis is morally correct and therefore hardly releases
                            us from criticism. I fully realize the restrictive dimensions of this
                            proposal, but it would not compare with the restrictions imposed by the
                            racist South African Government upon its non-white citizens and foreign
                            visitors.”</p>
                        <p>3. Unless Embassy has other suggestion, we not planning comment further

                                >Diggs</persName> but will confine comments to his proposal re
                            non-use of segregated facilities. While we appreciate manifold problems
                            latter would pose, we believe it would be useful to consider whether
                            there are not some areas in which abstention from visits to or use of
                            segregated facilities by US personnel could be achieved without
                            counterproductive results. Would appreciate Embassy views and specific
                            suggestions re this possibility.</p>

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. While perhaps not having all details, I am assuming from reftels that
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> has raised
                            further matter our general policy toward attendance segregated
                            gatherings in South Africa following our response on Malan Opera House
                            opening.</p>
                        <p>2. Obviously we cannot keep doors open for meaningful contacts with all
                            elements in South Africa if we are to avoid all segregated gatherings or
                            facilities. We can, however, seek draw distinction between those events
                            such as Malan Opera House opening which become particularly identified
                            with apartheid and those events which are normal and necessary part of
                            diplomatic courtesy. I believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJ_2"

                        <p>3. Assuming reply Chairman <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName>
                            required, I suggest we make brief response, emphasizing that this
                            administration, as have all previous administrations believes U.S. can
                            most effectively exercise influence and keep doors open for contacts
                            between citizens both countries by maintenance diplomatic relations.

                            such events would restrict our contacts with colored, Indian and black
                            groups as well as white. U.S. representatives, however, are under
                            instructions to use appropriate discretion in cases of events which by
                            their special character are particularly identified with the apartheid
                            system in order leave no doubt regarding our continued attitude of

                        <p>1. Swaziland, as a stable nation based on racial equality and in close
                            contact with its white-dominated neighbors, is an influence for
                            moderation and evolution away from racial repression and minority white
                            rule in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Total direct U.S. investment in Swaziland is relatively quite small.
                            There is a U.S.-owned fruit canning factory (Libby), and construction is
                            about to begin on a U.S.-owned radio station.</p>
                        <p>3. Swaziland is of negligible importance to the United States as a
                            supplier, although it is the world’s fifth largest exporter of asbestos
                            and also exports iron ore and coal.</p>

                        <p>6. Seek to exert a liberalizing influence on the present establishment to

                            white-dominated Africa and black Africa, is an influence for moderation

                        <p>3. Although U.S. trade is negligible, Botswana has commercially

                            and sulphur which could become important for the United States.</p>

                                >SAG</gloss> concerns this issue which he presumed to be: A)

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> then said to understand
                            U.S. position it was essential recognize four areas of our concern: A)
                            our domestic opinion which, while not fully crystallized on this issue,
                            reacted against what it considered repression, injustice or
                            discrimination elsewhere, particularly in racial matters; B) our
                            responsibilities to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>; C) our concern
                            over international law and support for <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss>; and D) our relations with Africa. Hynning asked how
                            (D) differed from (C). <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>
                            explained our bilateral relations with Africa, as distinct from our
                            relations in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> context, are affected by
                            our stand on Southern African issues. Commenting on Hynning’s initial
                            presentation, <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> said in his
                            opinion actions which embraced only Europeans and South Africans would
                            not be helpful; <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and African
                            participation in ultimate resolution essential.</p>
                        <p>6. In subsequent discussion:</p>
                        <p>A) Hynning described South Africa’s thinking on plebiscite<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d54fn3">See <ref target="#d46">Document 46</ref>.</note> as
                            providing a choice between: 1) continued administration by South Africa;
                            2) administration by <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>; 3)
                            independence. <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> was prepared have
                            international observers and to open plebiscite to all persons of <gloss
                                target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss> origin, including those banned and in
                            exile. Hynning added that present <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            Ambassador to Washington <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>
                            had made survey of <gloss target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss> for <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> before <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> brief to <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> and had
                            concluded <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> would win plebiscite.
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> would require two years to
                            prepare for plebiscite since not all peoples of territory ready now.</p>
                        <p>B) Hynning said <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> not banned
                            organization and participation <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>
                            in plebiscite not ruled out.</p>
                        <p>C) According Hynning, <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> would be
                            willing invite <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> visit <gloss
                                target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> for discussion <gloss target="#t_SWA_1"
                                >SWA</gloss> issue; he had been previously invited but had declined
                            come. Any discussion with an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            mission as such, however, would be politically impossible. But he did
                            not rule out possibility Africans accompanying <gloss target="#t_SYG_1"
                                >SYG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>D) Hynning emphasized any solution must start with premise <gloss
                                target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss> still has mandate authority. <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has not ceased consider <gloss
                                target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss> international territory. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> pointed out this would be
                            difficult after <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1">UNGA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> actions. Majority of nations in <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> would probably take position only issue
                            to be discussed would be transfer of authority—over whatever period—on
                            assumption mandate ended.</p>
                        <p>E) Hynning expressed difficulty in understanding why U.S. failed give
                            greater weight to <gloss target="#t_SA_1">SA</gloss>’s role as ally in
                            two world wars, anti-Communist state, and significant Western presence

                            Communist states. <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> said

                                3:00 p.m.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Ould Daddah has informed the press that at his meeting with you today he
                            will make known the Organization of African Unity’s position on “the
                            American debate on Rhodesian chrome purchases”.</p>
                        <p>This is a reference to the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>
                            Bill which passed the Senate last week. Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>’s amendment is a rider on the
                            Military Procurement Authorization Bill. It amends the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Participation Act of 1945 so as to
                            preclude any action thereunder to prohibit imports of strategic
                            commodities from any free world country so long as the importation of
                            such commodities from Communist countries are not also prohibited. The
                            effect of the bill is to remove the embargo on Rhodesian chrome.</p>
                        <p>The argument for the bill is that it is dangerous for the United States
                            to be dependent on the Soviet Union for chrome, and that U.S.
                            manufacturers are at a competitive disadvantage because the price of
                            Russian chrome (the only major producer other than Rhodesia) has almost
                            tripled since the embargo went into effect.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2"

                        <p>The ultimate prospects for the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> Amendment are now unclear. Despite vigorous
                            opposition by the State Department, it passed the Senate by a 36 to 46
                            vote. Senator Fulbright now plans to amend the amendment so that you
                            might keep it from going into effect on national security grounds or on
                            the grounds that it violates a treaty obligation. Apparently, some of
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>’s earlier supporters
                            are attracted to that formula. Both Senators Stennis and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>, however, are said to be adamant
                            that the amendment be retained in its present form.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Suggested Response:</p>
                        <p>—If finally passed, the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>
                            Amendment would leave the embargo in effect except for chrome.</p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="0182" xml:id="pg_143"/>
                        <p>—The Administration made a vigorous effort to defeat the <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment but it was nonetheless
                            passed by a ten vote margin. The Congress is hostile to the embargo
                            because although the United States has abided by it scrupulously, other
                            nations have not, and it does not appear to have been effective.
                            Moreover, it makes the U.S. dependent on the Soviet Union for the
                            essential commodity of chrome, and the Soviets have tripled the price of
                            their chrome since the embargo went into effect. Finally, Zambia’s
                            recent decision to import $20 million worth of corn from Rhodesia
                            undermined Congressional support for the embargo.</p>
                        <p>—We are now studying whether it is still possible to get this bill set
                            aside. We will do our best, but the situation is, frankly, not very
                            promising.</p>

                            the ass goes a long way. I think what you’ve got to do here is
                            [unclear]. I just feel Bill [Rogers] is—well, he cannot—he will continue

                            that, I want to assure you what I think you heard me say, and I talked
                            on the phone today with <persName corresp="#p_HERG_1">Heath</persName>
                            [about] this, but we will not embarrass you on Rhodesia or South Africa.
                            Now, the point that I think Henry heard me talk to these Africans when
                            they were in here the other day, and he’s also seen what I had written
                            on that—on those memos as they come through. We have to take positions
                            because of our political situation, but I just feel so strongly on this
                            issue that it’s—but look, who was this—who’s the head of that, who’s
                            that head of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>? What country is
                            he from—?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Mauritania? Now,
                            Mauritania’s got—Mauritania, they’ve got a million two hundred thousand
                            people. They haven’t—they have to answer to the problems of a million
                            two hundred thousand instead of worrying about worrying about what’s
                            happened in Rhodesia or South Africa. So, he spent the whole time, you
                            know, yelling about that thing. Not yelling, but you know? They’re
                            talking about that. It reminded me of Sukarno. I—when I visited Sukarno
                            in ’53, here’s this great country and the rest, here’s this man with
                            this tremendous mystique, marvelously colorful. I was the Vice President
                            then, and, of course, it meant quite a bit for me to get over to him,
                            perhaps for him to receive me. But, on the other hand, I remember when I
                            talked to him—I was there three days—three-fourths of the time he’s
                            talking about West Irian.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSA_1">Douglas-Home</persName>: Um-hmm.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Now, the Indonesians
                            couldn’t even digest Indonesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSA_1">Douglas-Home</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: They don’t even want to
                            deal with a bunch of cannibals up there. You know what I mean? [unclear]
                            That became the great issue. <pb n="147" facs="0186" xml:id="pg_147"
                            />It’s always this. Now, in the case of Rhodesia, let me say whatever
                            you work out—whatever you work out, I’ll have you remember this, I don’t
                            be pushed on by that African group over there at State because I think
                            that—what else with the chrome thing have we decided?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have this <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I’ve been thinking about
                            that Rhodesian chrome thing. Your thought is to call in <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>? You’re going to do it in a
                            week?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I wanted
                            directions from you. I don’t oppose doing it with you as well as him. My
                            concern is if it gets out that the White House [unclear]—I mean on the
                            substantive stuff, protect the position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: A fight would turn
                            into an absolutely unbelievable foreign policy scandal and they would be
                            hacking away at us for months. I just wonder if we couldn’t get word to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>. The fact of the matter
                            is this, is that the sanctions are coming out of the British Parliament,
                            but we’ll know early in November. They’re also close to a deal, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_HERG_1">Heath</persName> told you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Hmmm.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think those—with
                            either one these circumstances the sanctions would last if [unclear]
                            anyway. If the British renew the sanctions and if the deal goes through
                            then, the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment would
                            become relevant. And then we could, we could do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Is there a reason or do we
                            want to give it a reason? I mean we need these votes in the U.N.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, we can do both.
                            We can keep this U.N. vote and then sanctions are coming up anyway at
                            about the same time.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Yeah. Now—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That would give you
                            about six weeks—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Fine. Now, having said
                            that let me—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That, I don’t
                            mind.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Let me—let me get one
                            thing across on my attitude towards the whole African problem, the South
                            African problem, because I think we’ve got to get State turned around on
                            this thing and that means, particularly, <persName corresp="#p_ND_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>. Of course, my attitude is that I know that State
                            in the past has had this African policy and for two reasons. Forget all
                            the goddamn principles. One is because they are concerned about the
                                posi<pb n="149" facs="0188" xml:id="pg_149"/>tion of the United
                            States among the new African countries; that’s your point. The other
                            point that they’re concerned about is the domestic American political
                            situation. They’re afraid of it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Fine. All right. My view
                            has come down to this, my view is: one, that the domestic American
                            political situation should be completely taken out of their feeling on
                            this. I make that decision and this position is not to be made on that
                            basis. For your information I consider it to be detrimental to American
                            political positions—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: —to go this way. You don’t
                            gain any votes from the blacks who give a shit what happens to Zambia.
                            You get it from the others. You see my point?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: The second point is: On
                            the other one, I do not believe that it is worth our while to do
                            something for the Africans that’s against the British or somebody else.
                            The third thing is that it’s in the interest of the Africans, and I have
                            said the same thing—I did say the same thing to Sukarno in 1953—for us
                            to guide them in the direction of solving their own internal problems
                            and get their eyes the hell off of the problems far away. It does no
                            favor to the Africans for us to play their game. For another reason, for
                            the Africans to come in and see the President of the United States, as
                            they did the other day, and to waste their time and my time for 40
                            minutes talking about the problems that didn’t affect their own
                            countries is an indication of the problem. Now, I want this understood.
                            I think this policy—this is not my policy and I just got to get it out.
                            Now, shall I do that by bringing them all into a meeting to tell them
                            that? No, that’ll all leak all over the government, but that wouldn’t
                            bother me either. But I think we’ve got to understand it. Now, I—we have
                            the South African problem—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me get <persName
                                corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> in. Let me get, uh—the trouble
                            is that without strong leadership over there you shouldn’t have to do
                            it, because they’ll leak it. They don’t mind cutting you up.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And while I agree with
                            you that the Negroes don’t help us any it doesn’t do—we don’t gain
                            anything by making anything [unclear]—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: —over this issue what
                            we’re doing—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: No. They’re looking for a
                            right, for a reason to [unclear].</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, you could call
                                <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> in.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: How the hell would
                                <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> want it dealt
                            with?</p>
                        <pb n="150" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_150"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, gosh, if it
                            would help, too. [unclear] Let me try it and then if it doesn’t work we
                            shouldn’t [unclear] you’ve got too much relying on it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Sure. The point, though,
                            on this: I just want—this is my policy. I thought everybody understood
                            it was.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yeah.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And they come out and make
                            a goddamn announcement<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> on this thing, and the <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment. Now they should have
                            consulted with me on that goddamned thing—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, the
                            worst of it is that they did consult you. They were told you wouldn’t do
                            it—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Well, were they told?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, that’s how
                            the paper arose to you. They—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: But did you pass it on to
                            them? I know—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I passed it on
                            and more.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Get [unclear] to deal with
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It went back and forth
                            between couriers because I didn’t want them to—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I know.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: —leak it. But the way
                            this came up is they wanted the White House to be in the clear.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: That’s right. I said “no”
                            on it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I said, “I cannot do
                            this without the President’s approval.” I then wrote that memo to you on
                            which you wrote these strong words.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3"><ref
                                    target="#d56">Document 56</ref>.</note> I think I’m trying to
                            say that, Mr. President, orders are to stay the hell out of this
                            one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Hmmm.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And then they put out
                            the word that State is for it and the White House is against it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Do they have a story to
                            that effect?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right. I told
                            this to <persName corresp="#p_SHD_1">Hugh Scott</persName> and to a lot
                            of other people. Then Rogers called <persName corresp="#p_SHD_1">Hugh
                                Scott</persName> and said, “No, everybody’s against it.” And,
                            uh—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Why don’t you get the word
                            to them down there or then I can do it. I just—I’d hate to—I’m going to
                            be busy today, but I don’t want this to fall between stools and for us
                            to really irritate the conservatives when we don’t have to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The other—</p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="0190" xml:id="pg_151"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: They’re going to be
                            irritated by Taiwan, they’re going to be irritated by this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ll call <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>. Incidentally, all the news
                            stories today say that this actually helps the U.N. vote.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I know this.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is conversation unrelated to Rhodesia.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I know and the reason I
                            suggest you call [<persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>].</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ll call on the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: You see, basically,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> is my friend, a very
                            close one, and we’d appreciate it if he stands with us. You know all
                            that, Henry. The whole purpose of this, we just, we can’t tell you, but
                            [unclear]—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that the Virginia
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Oh, sure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh yeah. I know, I
                            know him very well. I can handle him, but he, uh—besides, he’ll keep a
                            secret [unclear].</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I’d rather if you did it.

                            [unclear]. Well, the point is, you can say, “We’ve got to tell you this
                            in confidence. We’ve got some good news on the [unclear] and the British
                            and the President told <persName corresp="#p_SHD_1">Hugh
                                [Scott]</persName> that you will not—you will back him. Regardless
                            of what the settlement is we’ll back him, but this is going to take
                            about six weeks. If it does not go, I will publicly back his
                            amendment.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: And the other thing and
                            it’s considering the fact that we could need two or three votes from the
                            blacks on the Taiwan thing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me get him right
                            away. I think—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Fine.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I know him quite
                            well.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Right. Sure. Just say that
                            we have appreciated his great support and everything and that I—that as
                            a matter of fact, you can just say: “I want to tell you privately that
                            the President was, frankly, very disturbed when the statement was made
                            by Scott.”<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">Not further identified.</note>
                            Because you can say, “I—and please don’t put this out because we don’t
                            want to have a public fight about it, but I know that the President has
                            told me. He says ‘I think the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> Amendment is the right approach here,’ but that you
                            can’t do it and he’ll have to deal with it.” He’ll understand.</p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="0191" xml:id="pg_152"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>

                            God, that’s—we may just change the signals and support the goddamn
                            thing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it will go
                            through without our formal support, but we can just—if we get out of the
                            way. [unclear] From the middle of November on I think we’re in pretty

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: I’m afraid right now they

                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> in New York Oct 4.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> how he saw development of South
                            West Africa issue from South African viewpoint. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> noted that U.S. position was and
                            would continue to be determined by its respect for court’s decision and
                            by its necessary awareness of both United Nations and African
                            relationship to South West African problem. U.S. did not wish to get in
                            middle of problem. At same time, U.S., involved as it is in <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> consideration, would be interested in
                            any paths which might exist for satisfactory outcome of issue.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> said he was speaking
                            privately and personally and Quote might not perhaps say the same thing
                            in Pretoria Unquote. He felt it was necessary and he felt this was the
                            Minister’s position, to avoid closing off in the present consideration
                            of the problem any possible avenues for resolving it. South Africa, he
                            said, wishes to rethink this <pb n="153" facs="0192" xml:id="pg_153"
                            />whole question. Much will depend on determining what people of South
                            West Africa want and South Africa hopes to do this over next several
                            months by quiet soundings. South Africa will not necessarily be bound by
                            assumptions of past. When <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName>
                            asked about <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> said South Africa was not clear
                            whom <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> really represented. He did
                            not exclude possibility that <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>
                            might at some point play role in solution.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> said he also, speaking
                            personally, had felt that at least some Africans recognized realities
                            South West African problem and that South Africa should not exclude
                            possibility of Africans accepting approach to issue which recognized in
                            some form African interests.</p>
                        <p>5. South Africa had expressed its readiness discuss area with Secretary
                            General of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Would South Africa also
                            be prepared for <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> representatives
                            accompany <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>? <persName
                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> said <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> would be unable accept anyone coming under <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> label. He did not rule out possibility
                            individual Africans, including President of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> in national capacity, coming to South Africa.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_ND_1">Newsom</persName> asked whether despite
                            South Africa unwillingness accept conclusion of <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> opinion South Africans might be prepared leave this
                            question aside and talk about future, including removal of legal
                            irritants, such as Terrorism Act. <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1"
                                >Fourie</persName> said, again speaking personally, South Africa
                            might be prepared put less stress on legal status and perhaps talk about
                            future leading toward conferences with peoples or referendum.</p>
                        <p>7. Pressures of time did not permit further conversation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> expressed appreciation for
                            discussion and said he would perhaps be floating some thoughts with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HJ_1">Hurd</persName> after <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> had given matter additional

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DSA_1">Alec Douglas-Home</persName> announced to
                            the House of Commons today that he will go to Rhodesia on November 14 to
                            attempt to reach an agreement with <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The British have informed our Embassy in London<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d61fn2">Not further identified.</note> that there are still
                            two elements in dispute between Britain and the Rhodesians. The first
                            concerns the British insistence on the rollback of racially
                            discriminatory laws enacted by the <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName> regime since the declaration of independence. The
                            second concerns the politically sensitive British need to establish that
                            they have independently examined and ascertained the public attitudes of
                            Rhodesians toward the settlement.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, it is highly unlikely that Sir Alec would be going to
                            Rhodesia if he were not confident that a settlement will result from his
                            visit. The British, in fact, have already worked out a scenario by which
                            the initial agreement would be followed by a two or three month period
                            during which the British will, somehow, discharge their commitment to
                            “examine” the attitude of the Rhodesian people. The British consider
                            that this will be a period of particular sensitivity, and they will be
                            sending a senior official (Lord Godber) to Washington to explain to us
                            the mechanics they have in mind and to underline their need for a
                            moratorium on criticism during this two to three month period. The
                            British will then report to the President of the Security Council that
                            an agreement has been reached and that, therefore, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sanctions on Rhodesia are no longer
                            necessary. Only at that point, will the British themselves terminate
                            their sanctions program.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, the British are hoping to avoid a Security Council meeting on
                            the termination of sanctions. I would judge that hope to be extremely
                            naive. No agreement that the British can make with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> is at all likely to be
                            satisfactory to a majority of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> nations
                            or, indeed, a majority of Security Council members. The Rhodesian issue
                            will proba<pb n="155" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_155"/>bly be seized upon by
                            the Chinese representatives as an opportunity for them to assert
                            leadership among non-white countries. The Soviets can also be counted
                            upon to be super-virtuous in supporting African denunciations of the
                            British “sellout”.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that the British go ahead with their present plans, our problem
                            will be to walk a narrow line between making the British position more
                            difficult, and taking positions in which we, ourselves, become the
                            villain of the piece and pay the political costs for the British
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>The British have taken their initiative without consultation with us and
                            played a distinctly unhelpful role on the recent Chinese representation
                            matter. They, therefore, have no particular claim on us in connection
                            with this problem.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The British sanctions
                            are about 80 percent of the total sanctions, so after that, there’ll be
                            no sense for anyone else having any sanctions. So I think that we should
                            just keep quiet about the U.N. thing because, it will become a moot
                            issue if the British make a deal, and—</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>: Well, that’s the thing to
                            tell State: that the British are leading here, and we don’t want to get
                            into it now. But what would you tell them?</p>

                            agreements with about 19 countries to provide nuclear fuel for research
                            and power reactors, ranging from 500 kg (Argentina) to 335,000 kg

                        <p>State notes several factors supporting an agreement with South Africa
                            including (1) our announced policy that we are prepared to enter into
                            new agreements; (2) our effort to establish the US as a reliable
                            supplier not overly susceptible to political considerations; (3) the
                            foreign exchange benefit to the US of about $250M over the 30 years; (4)
                            South Africa’s adherence to non-proliferation safeguards on its exports
                            of uranium to other countries; (5) South Africa’s acceptance of
                            International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; (6) the mutually
                            beneficial cooperation between the US and South Africa in the nuclear
                            energy field; and (7) the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy’s informal
                            indications of its support for such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>State also notes that if South Africa builds several more plants before
                            the year 2000 as planned and uses US-type reactors, Ex-Im Bank policy
                            guidelines toward South Africa may have to be reviewed. At present,
                            however, indications are that South Africa considers financing no
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>On the negative side, State notes that there is a likelihood of some
                            adverse domestic and international criticism of an agreement with South
                            Africa because of (1) its apartheid policy, (2) the possible military
                            applications of the technology and materials involved, (3) the long-term
                            nature of the commitment, and (4) the fact that South Africa has not
                            signed the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1">NPT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We agree with State that the factors supporting such an agreement clearly
                            outweigh the political disadvantages.</p>

                            U.S. policy of a British-Rhodesian settlement acknowledging Rhodesia’s
                            independence and calling for the termination of sanctions. The study
                            should also deal with the implication of failure of the present
                            negotiations to produce a political settlement. The study should, inter
                            alia:</p>
                        <p>1. Assess the probable reaction in the United Nations and elsewhere to a
                            British-Rhodesian agreement and the issues which this development is
                            likely to pose for U.S. policy.</p>

                            sanctions program.</p>
                        <p>3. Examine the legal, political, and economic implications involved in
                            (a) U.S. recognition of an independent Rhodesia, and (b) the
                            establishing of diplomatic or consular relations therewith.</p>

                            our bilateral relations with the countries primarily concerned.</p>

                            settlement which we believe can be demonstrated to be in full accordance
                            with the first Four Principles, and which we shall hope to show to be
                            acceptable to the Rhodesian people as a whole under the Fifth Principle.
                            I am sure that the settlement offers the Africans in Rhodesia a real
                            prospect of political, social and economic advance. It is moreover

                            particularly in relation to the United Nations. He will of course be at

                            will be planning later to go to New York for talks there.</p>
                        <p>The way ahead now hinges on our demonstrating, in the “Test of
                            Acceptability” which is to be carried out by a Commission led by a
                            British Judge, that all the races in Rhodesia accept the settlement as
                            the way out of present stagnation and an increasingly dark future.
                            Subject to this, we would pass the necessary legislation granting
                            Rhodesia independence, and at this stage our sanctions legislation would
                            be terminated. All this will of course take a little time.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, it will be all-important to aim for the greatest degree of
                            international acceptance which it is possible to obtain for the
                            settlement. There are opponents of any agreement with the Rhodesians.
                            There is an obvious danger that they will use every effort in the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> to engineer opposition to the settlement regardless of
                            the views or interests of the Rhodesian Africans. They may well try to
                            forestall the outcome of the “Test of Acceptability” by action in the
                            Security Council. We shall at all costs have to prevent this. In the
                            first instance our aim will be to persuade as many Governments as
                            possible not to take up firm positions against the settlement before the
                            result of the “Test of Acceptability” is known. In particular we shall
                            be seeking the necessary number of supporting votes (or at least
                            absentations) to prevent any unacceptable resolution being passed in the
                            Council. In the longer term we shall all need to have it accepted that
                            the implementation of a successful settlement has brought about a
                            situation in which sanctions resolutions have lapsed. Here again we must
                            expect strong opposition from some quarters.</p>
                        <p>I believe that we are agreed that the existing situation had become
                            increasingly unrealistic and damaging, and I hope that you will feel
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DSA_1">Alec Douglas-Home</persName> has
                            achieved a solution which we can all support. Certainly your help will
                            be immensely valuable to us in the task of explaining the settlement and
                            resisting attempts to undermine and destroy it. It will be a great
                            encouragement to us if we know we can count on this.</p>

                            veto, which would however be used if needed. Godber expressed measured
                            optimism that majority Rhodesians would find settlement acceptable and
                            that whole business could be concluded first half 1972. <hi

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> Minister of State Godber saw Acting
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> November 26 to
                            discuss Rhodesian settlement. Turned over copies of settlement document

                            report to Parliament. Godber explained future electoral provisions in
                            particular detail, and said agreement reached is fully compatible with
                            first four principles under which settlement sought. Compatibility with
                            fifth principle, acceptability to majority Rhodesians, of course remains
                            to be tested. <pb n="164" facs="0203" xml:id="pg_164"/>Godber said all
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> asks is that judgment be
                            withheld until commission to be set up to look into this has
                            investigated and made its report.</p>
                        <p>2. In addition to chairman Lord Pearce, commission will include Lord
                            Harlech and Sir Maurice Dorman plus other members. It will be empowered
                            go anywhere and see anyone in Rhodesia, Godber said, although he said
                            later in response to question it probably would not be given access to
                            persons convicted of criminal as compared political offenses. Once
                            commission is set up, Godber thought it could conclude work in couple of
                            months.</p>
                        <p>3. If committee reports majority acquiescence, Rhodesian Government is to
                            carry out all steps it has undertaken, and <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> will then do likewise, with process culminating in
                            Rhodesian independence. Godber thought this might all be carried out
                            within first half 1972 (by Easter, he personally hoped). If committee
                            reports majority is opposed to settlement, <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> will bow out of whole thing.</p>
                        <p>4. Immediate <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> concern is weathering
                            expected storm in Security Council.<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">For a
                                discussion of the Pearce Commission and Southern Rhodesia at the
                                United Nations, see <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United
                                    Nations, 1972</hi>, pp. 75–77, 118–121.</note> Godber said there
                            will undoubtedly be resolutions put forward which <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> cannot accept. Will veto if necessary
                            but would prefer see sufficient abstentions to prevent passage, which
                            would mean seven, and hoped US would abstain. Acting Secretary made no
                            commitment on this point.</p>
                        <p>5. In sum, Godber said this was best possible settlement under
                            circumstances, it should be acceptable to Rhodesian blacks, and he hoped
                            they would be let alone think matter out and express views freely.</p>
                        <p>6. In response various questions, Godber said (a) <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> absolutely opposed to active <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> participatory role in commission,
                            although he could perceive some utility in having <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> observers, if of impartial nature—a
                            possibility on which he personally had grave doubts; (b) Rhodesian
                            Government will not retain overriding powers which would permit future
                            independent government renege on agreement. Will revert in some respects
                            to 1961 constitution which contains only standard emergency powers
                            section; (c) <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> would have no truck
                            with any kind of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> action purporting to
                            set up governing body for Rhodesia; (d) if commission reports majority
                            sentiment favorable to settlement, and follow-up actions then taken by
                            both governments, <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> will not request
                                <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> to revoke sanctions, but simply
                            inform <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss> that grounds for sanctions no
                            longer exist; (e) <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> sees little
                            likelihood successful Rhodesian right-wing opposition to settlement; (f)
                            It is difficult predict how long it might take for black Rhodesians to
                            attain voting majority but important thing is that there will be
                            unimpeded progress toward that end, and end is inevitable at some future
                            time.</p>

                        <p>7. In concluding remarks, <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName>
                            said credibility of commission’s report will depend very much on way it
                            operates. Godber agreed, said this is one argument for having <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> observers, although <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> has not yet thrashed this question
                            out. <persName corresp="#p_IJN_1">Irwin</persName> returned to question
                            whether future Rhodesian Governments could be depended on carry out
                            agreement in good faith. Godber said future constitutional changes would
                            require separate majority of both white and black Rhodesians, which
                            should help ensure against reneging by future Rhodesian Governments. If
                            one is thinking of external guarantees of some sort, this means
                            bayonets, which Godber said is out of question.</p>

                            developments affecting U.S. relations with the African liberation

                            with the liberation movements. It suggests a need to clarify our
                            objectives and to develop criteria for choosing among policy options in
                            this area.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background:</p>
                        <p>The African liberation movements are targeted at South Africa, South West
                            Africa (Namibia), Southern Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese
                            Guinea. Most of the liberation movements date <pb n="166" facs="0205"
                                xml:id="pg_166"/>from the period when the greater part of
                            sub-Saharan Africa became independent, that is, the late 1950’s and
                            early 1960’s.</p>
                        <p>None of the targeted African countries and territories have a single
                            unified liberation movement. All are represented by at least two and
                            often by more groups (see attached list).<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2"
                                >“African Liberation Movements,” attached but not printed.</note>
                            Within each movement there are competing leadership factions. These
                            cleavages have a number of causes including tribalism and Sino-Soviet
                            rivalry.</p>
                        <p>The principal sources of support for the liberation movements have been
                            the Communist world and the African Liberation Committee of the
                            Organization of African Unity. A strong campaign led by the Afro-Asian
                            bloc has also begun in the United Nations and other international
                            organizations to obtain explicit <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            sanction for the liberation movements similar to the approval already
                            contained in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Charter. These
                            pressures have begun to affect US working relationships in nearly all of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> organizations including such
                            highly technical bodies as the Universal Postal Union and the World
                            Health Organization.</p>
                        <p>While their goals of independence for the Portuguese African territories,
                            the return to constitutionality and independence on the basis of African
                            majority rule in Southern Rhodesia, independence for South West Africa,
                            and the termination of apartheid and political and legal restrictions on
                            South Africa’s non-whites are all close to official U.S. policies
                            favoring self-determination and opposing racial discrimination, we do
                            not support the use of force or violence in pursuit of these goals.</p>
                        <p>We officially abhor the racial policies of South Africa and Southern
                            Rhodesia and continue to hope Portugal will recognize the long-term
                            advantages of adopting a policy of self-determination for its African
                            territories, stressing that Portugal’s African policy is an important
                            factor in the West’s ability to influence the direction and pace of
                            events in Africa as a whole.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Policy:</p>
                        <p>U.S. policy toward the various liberation movements has been to maintain
                            discreet and unobtrusive but hopefully useful contacts, avoiding
                            measures which could be interpreted as hostile to friendly governments.
                            While our ability to assist these movements is severely circumscribed by
                            the fact that we oppose force as a means of promoting change, one of our
                            principal goals has been to encourage, if possible, the various
                            liberation movements away from over-dependence on Sino-Soviet
                            assistance.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Programs: <gloss target="#t_SASP_1">SASP</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_EATP_1">EATP</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>Since most of the liberation movements, with the exception of those of
                            Portuguese Guinea, have had serious difficulty in recruiting supporters
                            within their target countries and territories, members have been
                            recruited largely from refugees who have been attracted by offers of
                            education or employment. In an effort to exert a positive and
                            non-violent influence we therefore adopted a few programs beginning in
                            the early 1960’s to train Southern African refugees in occupations other
                            than armed insurgency. Our major effort was based on two activities, the
                            Southern African Student’s Program (<gloss target="#t_SASP_1"
                                >SASP</gloss>) and the East African Training Program (<gloss
                                target="#t_EATP_1">EATP</gloss>).</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_SASP_1">SASP</gloss> was created in 1961. Its aim is to
                            develop educated leaders from among the young African refugees who have
                            fled white dominated areas and who could be of service to their people
                            if political conditions improve. Since 1961, 511 students have received
                                <gloss target="#t_SASP_1">SASP</gloss> scholarships. There are 162
                            students currently in the program and the <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss>–71 cost was $569,000. As recently as <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–67 the <gloss target="#t_SASP_1"
                                >SASP</gloss> budget was $1,800,000 or more than one half of CU/AF’s
                            budget. In an effort to reduce the cost of the program no new students
                            were accepted in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–68 and <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–69. The program was resumed on a limited
                            scale in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>–70 and it is anticipated
                            that in the future approximately five new scholarships will be awarded
                            annually to graduate students.</p>
                        <p>The principal difficulty with <gloss target="#t_SASP_1">SASP</gloss> has
                            been that upon graduation the participants have been unable or unwilling
                            to return to their home countries and other African countries have been
                            most reluctant to receive them. Although more than 150 have gone to
                            independent African countries, arrangements have had to be made for many
                            others to remain in the United States until they can find employment in
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_EATP_1">EATP</gloss> was begun under <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> sponsorship in 1963 to provide
                            refugees, who were not qualified for <gloss target="#t_SASP_1"
                                >SASP</gloss> university level scholarships, with secondary
                            educations. Two schools were established: the Kurasini International
                            Education Center in Dar es Salaam, and Nkumbi International College in
                            Zambia. Due to difficulties in attracting students and a decrease in the
                            flow of refugees into Tanzania and Zambia in the late 1960’s, a decision
                            was taken by <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> to turn the two
                            schools over to the Government of Tanzania in December 1969 for training
                            clerical workers for civil service employment. Nkumbi was turned over to
                            the Government of Zambia in December 1970. Nkumbi is still maintained
                            primarily as a school for refugees and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> has offered scholarships for refugee students there. At
                            present approximately 120 students receive scholarships at a cost of
                            $240,000 per year. Annual intake of new students is expected to be about
                            25 per year. We also make substantial contributions to <gloss
                                target="#t_UNHCR_1">UNHCR</gloss> which devotes much of its
                            resources to southern Africa.</p>

                        <p>In addition to training refugees to play useful roles some day in their
                            home countries, <gloss target="#t_SASP_1">SASP</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_EATP_1">EATP</gloss> have had the instrumental effect of
                            demonstrating U.S. concern for the problems of refugees from the white
                            dominated areas and of legitimizing contacts between representatives of
                            the U.S. government and those of the liberation movements which
                            nominated training candidates. Although most of the liberation movements
                            appear to be sincerely interested in keeping ties open to both the West
                            and the Communist world, the curtailment of <gloss target="#t_SASP_1"
                                >SASP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EATP_1">EATP</gloss> has
                            therefore had the practical effect of restricting the basis for our
                            communication with the movements. It has also increased their dependency
                            upon Communist sources of support for educational training as well as
                            military aid. This, in effect, works against one of our principal policy
                            goals vis-à-vis the liberation movements. That is, influencing them to
                            move away from over-dependence on Sino-Soviet assistance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Portuguese Trends:</p>
                        <p>One of the key policy initiatives of the Portuguese Government of Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName> is his
                            constitutional amendment giving a measure of autonomy to the overseas
                            territories. This development has potentially important consequences for
                            another aspect of U.S. policy affecting the liberation movements, that
                            is, our hope that Portugal will recognize the long-term advantages of a
                            policy of self-determination for its African territories. One of the
                            purported purposes of this constitutional amendment appears to be to
                            make some gesture toward self-determination without in any way turning
                            over political control to the blacks. (Lisbon 1622)<note n="3"

                            danger is that eventual administrative autonomy in the Portuguese
                            territories could result in the establishment of new Rhodesias.
                            Moreover, as a result of growing U.S. investment in Angola, our
                            facilities in the Azores, and our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            ties, the United States is identified with the Portuguese in both their

                        <p>The principal conclusion of this assessment is that the cumulative effect
                            of a number of recent ad hoc decisions and international developments
                            affecting U.S. relations with the African liberation movements may be to
                            impart an unintended direction to our overall policy. A number of
                            options, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, for adjusting
                            and/or reaffirming this policy should be considered. These include:</p>

                        <p>1) recognition of the importance of the liberation movements as symbols
                            in Africa and as channels for Soviet and Communist Chinese influence and
                            a decision that the United States accordingly should:</p>
                        <p>a) continue discreet contact with the movements’ leadership;</p>
                        <p>b) continue to provide educational and humanitarian assistance to
                            refugees;</p>
                        <p>2) provision of discreet help to pro-western leaders and their movements
                            short of providing arms and military equipment;</p>
                        <p>3) avoidance of any contact with the liberation movements as being
                            inconsistent with our policy opposing the use of force in providing a
                            solution to southern African problems.</p>
                        <p>The following are possible courses of action relating to options one and

                        <p>1) adoption by all U.S. diplomatic posts in Africa of an agreed plan of
                            action for handling contacts with liberation movement leaders;</p>
                        <p>2) consideration of alternatives to <gloss target="#t_SASP_1"

                            providing U.S. assistance to the refugees and maintaining contact with
                            their leaders, if such educational programs are either impractical or
                            inadvisable (feeding and health programs through volunteer agencies are

                            methods and that peaceful methods will be more effective in

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(1) Prohibit Soviet Chrome for Six Months.</p>
                        <p>State’s favored alternative is that you ban Soviet chrome for six months
                            so that we can go on legally prohibiting Rhodesian chrome during this
                            period, which may be long enough to see the British end sanctions. State
                            says you have ample authority to do this under the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Participation Act. Treasury disagrees,
                            noting that while you have legal authority to enforce <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sanctions, these are against Rhodesia
                            and not against the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Commerce
                            does not argue the legalities but feels that a restriction against the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> could seriously jeopardize
                            the possibilities of increased trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. State on the other hand feels that any damage to
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would be
                            limited. If we wanted to circumvent the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> Amendment this might be the simplest way. But it
                            would carry some risk for our Soviet relations before your Moscow trip.
                            I therefore would not recommend it.</p>

                            Strategic Materials.</p>
                        <p>State suggests you remove chrome from the list of strategic and critical
                            materials—and so make the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>
                            Amendment inapplicable to it—based on the fact that chrome is in ample
                            supply. <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss>, which has primary
                            responsibility for administering the strategic list objects strongly.
                            General Lincoln of <gloss target="#t_OEP_1">OEP</gloss> believes that
                            chrome remains a strategic material, and that if we tamper with our
                            standards for identifying such materials, we will jeopardize our whole
                            stockpile policy. This would endanger pending stockpile disposal bills
                            on the Hill which <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> hopes will yield
                            us $600 million. Commerce comments that removing chrome from the list
                            would be an evasion of the Congressional intent. I agree. Such a
                            transparent device to thwart Congress would undoubtedly get us into
                            trouble on the Hill.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">(3) Ask Congress For a Six Month Delay</p>
                        <p>This appears to be the least objectionable idea, but Congress is out of
                            session and could probably not act quickly, if at all, when they return.
                            Furthermore, the whole sanctions program will probably die this Spring
                            when the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and Rhodesia finalize their
                            settlement. Even if we wanted to ask the Congress for a delay, we would
                            have to implement the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName>
                            Amendment in the meantime.</p>
                        <p>I think we should simply implement the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                                >Byrd</persName> Amendment as Congress intended to allow imports of
                            Rhodesian chrome. This is obviously not the time to restrict our trade
                            with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, nor can I see
                            jeopardizing our stockpile program or raising an unnecessary storm on
                            the Hill for acting against <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1"
                            >Byrd</persName>’s Amendment.</p>
                        <p>Following this course of action will require changes in Executive

                        <p><gloss target="#t_GE_1">GE</gloss> has recently inquired informally about
                            the possibility of a $50 million direct Ex-Im credit to finance the sale
                            of a nuclear power reactor for South Africa. Under present guidance,
                            Ex-Im provides insurance and guarantees up to a maximum of 10 years but
                            has not provided direct credits since 1959. The amount and form of Ex-Im
                            participation would be a quantum jump from this. In addition, the
                            character of the project would cause political problems in the rest of
                            Africa. Thus, for political reasons it is desirable to avoid using Ex-Im
                            credits to finance this sale.</p>
                        <p>A more acceptable alternative, which we, State, and Ex-Im favor, is to
                            have the Private Export Funding Corporation (<gloss target="#t_PEFCO_1"
                                >PEFCO</gloss>) provide the financing using Ex-Im Bank <hi

                                >PEFCO</gloss> has already extended credits for nuclear power plants
                            in Taiwan, Italy and Brazil. Although this approach would not be immune
                            from criticism—since <gloss target="#t_PEFCO_1">PEFCO</gloss> would rely
                            on Ex-Im guarantees—it maintains the distinction between <gloss

                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> credits. Ex-Im is anxious to approach

                        <p>b. Provides the communist states opportunities to increase their
                            influence in Africa;</p>
                        <p>c. Inhibits the development of normal relations with South Africa;
                            and</p>
                        <p>d. Causes dissension within the United States.</p>
                        <p>2. We must avoid being drawn into internal or external racial conflicts
                            involving South Africa.</p>
                        <p>3. We are interested in South Africa as an important source of essential
                            minerals—especially chrome, copper, platinum, gold, manganese and
                            vanadium.</p>
                        <p>4. Our trade with South Africa amounts to about $851 million annually
                            with a heavy favorable U.S. balance ($275 million) and the potential for
                            expansion of U.S. exports.</p>
                        <p>5. Direct private U.S. investment in South Africa was $864 million at the
                            end of 1970, and considerable potential exists for further profitable
                            investment. Approximately 320 U.S. firms have investment in South
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>6. We believe strategic considerations, while not crucial, are important
                            in terms of: denying the area to potential enemies; the availability of
                            landing and overflight rights for U.S. military aircraft; and access to
                            ship repair and logistic facilities.</p>
                        <p>7. Our <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> tracking station is
                            significant to the space program, and its importance will increase with
                            greater deep space probe activity.</p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="0213" xml:id="pg_174"/>
                        <p>8. The South African atomic energy program, particularly their “new
                            secret process for enriching uranium” may have important political
                            (proliferation) and economic implications for the United States.</p>

                        <p>1. The maintenance of peace in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Realization by South Africa that its racial policies are untenable
                            internationally and that peaceful, evolutionary movement toward equal
                            rights for all South Africans will reduce the risk of violence.</p>
                        <p>3. Support for African initiatives leading toward more stable South
                            African/black African relations, based on full respect and equality.</p>
                        <p>4. Avoidance of U.S. identification with or the appearance of
                            acquiescence in South African racial policies.</p>
                        <p>5. Furtherance of the concept that whites and nonwhites can live together

                        <p>6. Peaceful resolution of South West African issues consistent with
                            self-determination, taking into account the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> opinion and African and <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                        <p>7. Avoidance of the development of South Africa, Rhodesia and the
                            Portuguese territories into a bloc.</p>
                        <p>8. Continued profitable trade with South Africa and maintenance of U.S.
                            investments and access to key resources.</p>
                        <p>9. Equal employment practices by U.S. firms in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>10. Continuing contacts with all elements of the South African
                            population.</p>
                        <p>11. Support for the United Nations as a political institution which has a
                            constructive role in the resolution of African problems.</p>
                        <p>12. Continued access to South African military intelligence and continued
                            minimal level of cooperation with the South African military consistent
                            with U.S. national security requirements.</p>
                        <p>13. Retention of the <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> and Air Force
                            Tracking Stations.</p>
                        <p>14. Retention of overflight and landing rights currently deriving from
                            the Air Force Tracking Station agreement.</p>
                        <p>15. Avoidance of military involvement over South West Africa with South
                            Africa or the Portuguese territories or with the liberation groups.</p>

                            States</p>
                        <p>1. Closer economic, political, and military relations with the United
                            States and the West, for practical strategic reasons and in order to
                            enhance South Africa’s international image and acceptability.</p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_175"/>
                        <p>2. U.S. acceptance of the view that South Africa’s racial problem is an
                            internal matter for South Africa to deal with.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. acquiescence in the South African position regarding South West
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>4. U.S. acceptance of South African views of its strategic

                        <p>5. U.S. support for South Africa’s policy of improving trade and
                            relations with black Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. Recommended Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>1. Continue to make U.S. position clear, both in public statements and in
                            bilateral talks and démarches with <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>,
                            that we condemn apartheid as unjust and ultimately unworkable.</p>
                        <p>2. Make it clear that we do not support or endorse violence as a means of
                            effecting change.</p>
                        <p>3. Encourage, through wider communication, evolution of white racial
                            attitudes away from apartheid:</p>
                        <p>a. Increase U.S. educational and exchange programs for South Africans of
                            all races.</p>
                        <p>b. Continue to press the South Africans on visas for American visitors,
                            particularly officials and Members of Congress.</p>
                        <p>c. Assign black American personnel to South Africa as soon as practicable
                            and as appropriate to the varying needs of the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>d. Through discreet use of informational techniques and cultural
                            presentations, provide South Africans of all races maximum exposure to
                            the thought, life-style and social-consciousness of the West and the
                            United States in particular.</p>
                        <p>e. While avoiding use of the term “dialogue” or endorsement of any
                            particular approach, and while discouraging any hopes for early results,
                            point out to black African states that increased communication has value
                            as an additional type of exposure and pressure on South Africa.</p>
                        <p>f. Avoid endorsement of South Africa’s “outward policy.”</p>
                        <p>g. Continue to oppose moves to oust South Africa from international
                            organizations when such moves are in violation of the organization’s
                            constitution, emphasizing that our opposition is a matter of principle
                            and is not specifically on behalf of the South African Government.</p>
                        <p>h. Continue cooperation with American religious, legal and other private
                            groups offering humanitarian and professional assistance to South
                            Africans and South West Africans prosecuted under restrictive,

                        <pb n="176" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_176"/>
                        <p>4. Continue humanitarian and educational assistance to South African and
                            South West African refugees.</p>
                        <p>5. Continue the arms embargo against South Africa.</p>
                        <p>6. Keep contacts with the South African Defense Force to the minimum
                            required for continued access to South African military intelligence and
                            minimal military cooperation consistent with U.S. national security
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>7. Keep to an absolute minimum our association with the South African
                            Police, consistent with continued access to intelligence
                            information.</p>
                        <p>8. Retain the <gloss target="#t_NASA_1">NASA</gloss> tracking station in
                            South Africa as long as it does not represent an unacceptable political
                            liability.</p>
                        <p>9. Keep under review the continued requirement for Air Force Tracking
                            Station 13.</p>
                        <p>10. Keep under review our present policy of non-use of South African
                            ports by U.S. Naval vessels except in case of emergency.</p>
                        <p>11. Continue our policy of neither encouraging nor discouraging new U.S.
                            investment in South Africa, but make sure interested companies are fully
                            aware of the political, social and economic problems associated with
                            South Africa’s racial policies and of the public relations problems
                            resulting from investment in South Africa. Invite potential U.S.
                            investors’ attention to the advantages of investment in Botswana,
                            Lesotho and Swaziland which are in the Rand customs and currency
                            area.</p>
                        <p>12. Suggest to U.S. firms in South Africa that public relations and other
                            advantages might accrue from supporting developmental projects in
                            Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, such as the <gloss target="#t_UBLS_1"
                                >UBLS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>13. Encourage U.S. firms to follow fair employment practices in
                            employment of non-whites, particularly with regard to pay, training and
                            fringe benefits.</p>
                        <p>14. Continue to seek ways of assisting development of effective
                            representation of non-white labor.</p>
                        <p>15. Provide low profile facilitative services to U.S. exporters,
                            reporting trade opportunities in a factual, routine way.</p>
                        <p>16. While continuing present Eximbank policy with respect to South
                            Africa, remain alert to possible needs for liberalizing the policy to
                            enable U.S. exporters to meet terms offered by third-country
                            competitors. Eximbank policy currently permits insurance and guarantee
                            coverage for all commodities; it limits the term ordinarily to five
                            years, but extends it to not more than ten years for individual
                            commodities if the proposed term has been internationally defined as
                            normal for those commodities or if it is necessary to meet
                            government-supported competition. Present policy permits discount loans
                            of less than $2 million, <pb n="177" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_177"/>with
                            certain restrictions. Direct loans and all other Eximbank facilities are
                            unavailable.</p>
                        <p>17. Discreetly explore the South African plebiscite proposal and other
                            possible arrangements to resolve the question of the status of South
                            West Africa.</p>
                        <p>18. Continue to seek ways of aiding development of economic and political
                            independence in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland and encourage the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>, as appropriate, to permit this
                            development.</p>
                        <p>19. While avoiding expressions of approval or support for the policy of
                            separate development, challenge the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            to demonstrate the sincerity of its policy by accelerating physical,
                            social and economic development of the homelands.</p>
                        <p>20. If the homelands are found to offer the Africans some positive
                            chances for constructive advancement, consider whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> could encourage private U.S.
                            investment in these areas without incurring unacceptable political
                            cost.</p>
                        <p>21. Urge the South African Government to improve the lot of non-white
                            South Africans in such practical areas as family stability, property
                            ownership, rural development, education and training, and greater
                            political and economic rights.</p>
                        <p>22. Monitor closely the South Africa atomic energy program.</p>

                            do so in face of widespread disapproval of Escher report and of need to
                            avoid US or Western imprint on any future efforts.<note n="4"

                                    74</ref>.</note> We wish to avoid being closely identified with
                            any particular course of action at initial Council meeting but believe
                            we (or French if they are willing to continue leading role) can make
                            certain observations along following lines to guide discussion in a
                            useful direction. Purpose of early discussion should be to draw out
                            Africans on whether and how they think mandate should be extended and
                            what they realistically think can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>2. Discussion should take note of what two missions to Namibia/South
                            Africa have already accomplished. Most important development is that a
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence has been established and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> now has access to peoples of the
                            territory. The Escher report has confirmed certain <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> tenets on Namibia: the overwhelming
                            majority of black Namibians are <pb n="180" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_180"
                            />against continued South African presence in the territory and do not
                            want separate development. Exercise has clearly heightened awareness
                            among Namibians of alternative to continued South African rule. South
                            Africans are now less likely to rush into repressive policies in Namibia
                            than in the past.</p>
                        <p>3. Security Council should not become deeply involved in discussion of
                            merits of Escher report. Escher’s efforts should be viewed as a stage in
                            continuing process and not as a definitive indication of where <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>
                            stand on Namibia. While Council free to reject Escher’s efforts, we
                            believe it would be short-sighted to do so in view of some positive
                            aspects of discussions with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>, i.e. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>’s implicit willingness to treat Namibia as a
                            whole by appointment of advisory council directly under him, his
                            readiness to examine removal of restrictions on movement and to permit
                            legitimate political activity. Council could deal with problem of
                                Escher/<persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> statement in
                            eventual resolution by taking note of Escher report. <hi rend="italic"
                                >FYI</hi>. We do not believe we should make any effort to retain
                            Escher as <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>’s representative. It
                            would be better to treat his mission as if it all along had been
                            intended as a one-shot affair. <hi rend="italic">End FYI.</hi></p>
                        <p>4. Although <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>’s mandate should
                            continue it obvious that he cannot personally undertake travel and
                            consultations necessary. A Secretariat official (<hi rend="italic"
                                >FYI</hi>, perhaps Guyer or Chacko <hi rend="italic">End FYI</hi>)
                            would probably be a better choice than again going through tedious
                            process that resulted in appointment of Escher. Council should try to
                            avoid putting future representatives under same pressure that Escher
                            faced to bring home the bacon in a very short period of time. Deadlines
                            lead to one-shot operations instead of a continued <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence. There should be periodic
                            review to keep pressure on <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> but
                            timing should be at about six-month intervals to allow room for maneuver
                            and more opportunity for <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> to be
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>5. We believe that three-member advisory committee should maintain its
                            present role. More direct participation such as accompanying <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>’s representative on his rounds would
                            probably be rejected by South Africa. Council could ensure that <gloss
                                target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss>’s mandate does not allow for any
                            commitments without Council approval and in this way there would be no
                            need for advisory group to play a greater role as watchdog.</p>

                                submitted a statement to Secretary General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> on April 30 clarifying his
                                government’s position on the future of Namibia. See <hi

                                722.</note> it became clear to me that what faces <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> now is decision whether we should stay
                            entirely on sidelines, adopting neutral posture, or play more active
                            role. Our in-house analysis led me to conclusion that however attractive
                            hands-off policy might appear to be, our own interests would be better
                            served by some degree of activism. Prior to receipt of <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, I had therefore instructed my
                            staff to draft telegram which was to have recommended similar course of
                            action as that set forth by <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss>. This
                            exercise no longer necessary, for I concur fully in both analysis and
                            recommended courses of action proposed in excellent <gloss
                                target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. I would like reiterate, however, certain points made by <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss> which are particularly pertinent
                            from this vantage point.</p>
                        <p>(A) First is my conviction that despite ambiguities and possible
                            loopholes, <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> statements are indeed
                            most positive and forthcoming ever made on this subject and that they
                            represent significant concession on its part.</p>
                        <p>(B) I regard <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> statements as genuine
                            attempt to continue dialogue on Namibia, and at some considerable
                            domestic risk from its right-wingers in Cabinet as well as from much of
                            white public in both South Africa and Namibia. In this connection,
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG_1">SYG</gloss> quite correct in his statement
                            that FonMin <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName> was in a
                            difficult position with <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> Cabinet

                                target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss>. One outcome of this could well be
                            sharp upturn in repression of black political leaders in Namibia—men
                            like Chief Kapuud could be silenced.</p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="0221" xml:id="pg_182"/>
                        <p>(C) <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss>’s reversion to hard line on
                                <gloss target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss> in turn would almost certainly
                            lead to spate of boycott and sanctions proposals, more inflamed
                            rhetoric, and very painful decisions for us to make re how to vote on
                            what will almost certainly be unrealistic, ineffective or simply
                            unacceptable resolutions.</p>
                        <p>(D) I strongly agree that some acknowledgement by <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"
                                >SAG</gloss> movement on this question is called for. Similarly,
                            importance we rightly attach to keeping dialogue alive and fact <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> has not been forthcoming lends great
                            weight, in our judgment, to <gloss target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss>’s
                            recommendation that we join in urgent and concerted effort to keep it
                            alive.</p>
                        <p>3. To be sure, undertaking an effort to prolong <gloss target="#t_SYG_1"
                                >SYG</gloss>’s mandate poses certain risks. We cannot be certain
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> will act in good faith in
                            conformance with language of its own proposals or will instead exploit
                            its ambiguities. And even if intentions are good now, there no <gloss
                                target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss> no assurance that domestic pressures
                            will not induce the pragmatic Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> to change once again his stance on <gloss
                                target="#t_SWA_1">SWA</gloss>. Nevertheless, I feel that these risks
                            are worth running. Without underestimating either the dangers of US
                            “activism” on this question or the difficulties of US démarches in

                            But there are also major ambiguities, and serious doubts that South

                            Pretoria; renewal of his mandate would depend largely on whether the

                            Although the African group was critical of Escher’s report on his

                            now state that:</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> are not compatible
                            with other South African statements and actions. The new South African
                            position, for example, sets no timetable beyond the vague statement that

                            introduced legislation in Parliament which would further develop the
                            system of “homelands” for separate tribal groupings in Namibia and has
                            issued proclamations conferring self-government on two such areas this
                            month. It has also set up a government-dominated Advisory Council for
                            the territory.</p>

                                1964. He asked: “Has a recent study of our economic policies
                                concerning South Africa been made, and if so, may I see the
                                conclusions reached?” (Ibid.)</note> has most recently been
                            addressed in an interagency policy planning paper on that country of

                        <p>As stated in the paper, our principal objective is “continued profitable
                            trade with South Africa and maintenance of US investments and access to
                            key resources.” Under this objective, our courses of action include
                            neither encouraging nor discouraging any US investment in <pb n="185"
                                facs="0224" xml:id="pg_185"/>South Africa, while making sure US
                            companies are fully aware of the political, social and economic problems
                            associated with South Africa’s racial policies and of the public
                            relations problem resulting from investment in South Africa. The paper
                            calls for providing low-profile facilitative services to US exporters
                            and, while continuing present Ex-Im Bank policy with respect to South
                            Africa, remaining alert to possible needs for liberalizing the policy to
                            enable US exporters to meet terms offered by third-country
                            competitors.</p>
                        <p>These elements of our policy toward South Africa, which reflect the
                            complex strategic, international and domestic considerations involved in
                            US-South African relations are considered currently valid. I have

                                assistance in upgrading South Africa’s maritime defenses. The United
                                States would provide technical and material support, [<hi

                                radars, long-range acoustic sensors, and sensor correlation and
                                analysis centers.</note> The program proposed would be a phased one
                            involving technical assistance from US commercial contractors, purchase
                            of equipment from US commercial sources and system operation by a new,
                            non-military South African agency. Our involvement would be facilitative
                            only (i.e., to assure issuance of export licenses for commercial
                            equipment and technical advice). No US military participation is
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>(<gloss target="#t_TS_1">TS</gloss>) We have examined the proposal
                            (attached) and believe it offers real advantages for US national
                            security at a modest political cost. South Africa’s strategic position
                            astride one of the world’s key shipping lanes is well known to us all.
                            In a crisis or war situation, access to information generated by such a
                            system could be highly valuable. Further, such cooperation would be
                            certain to enhance US-South African political-military relations and our
                            ability to influence attitudes within the South African military
                            leadership.</p>

                            would be operated by a new, non-military South African agency, but its
                            military/intelligence functions are clear and acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the intelligence benefits of the proposed agreement, the
                            intelligence community as a whole has not addressed the issue, but
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> believes that ocean
                            surveillance information provided by South Africa would be of marginal

                            limited. With the reopening of the Canal, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> believes it unlikely that Soviet use of the Cape routes
                            will again reach even the low level that existed during the period when
                            the Canal was closed. Moreover, the South African capability would be of
                            little use in monitoring activities in the Indian Ocean area. On the
                            other hand, Defense argues we would gain the advantage of a closer
                            military relationship with South Africa.</p>
                        <p>In our judgment, confirmed informally by both State and Defense,
                            agreement to the South African proposal would be contrary to the policy
                            on issuance of licenses for export of arms, equipment and associated
                            items to South Africa established by <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1"
                                >NSDM</gloss> 81 of August 17, 1970 (copy at Tab D).<note n="3"

                            <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 81 is the most recent statement
                            of an arms embargo policy dating back to 1963. In summary, the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> prohibits license issuance for all
                            equipment which has a clear and direct application to combat or to
                            internal security operations. It is the judgment of the Defense
                            Department that the preponderance of items necessary for a modern
                            surveillance system would fall into this category. For example, under
                            the policy guidance of <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 81, the
                            State Department earlier this year refused a license for export to South
                            Africa of Sonabuoys, a water borne senser device integral to any modern
                            surveillance system.</p>
                        <p>It appears, therefore, that an exemption to the general guidelines of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 81 will be necessary to allow
                            our agreement to the South Africa proposal. If such an exemption were to
                            become public knowledge, as we deem likely, it could be expected to have
                            both domestic and international consequences.</p>
                        <p>Internationally, even a limited exemption to our arms embargo policy
                            would be seen by Third World countries, especially those in Africa, as
                            an abrogation of moral responsibility and a reversal, in the name of
                            narrowly defined national interest, of long-standing policy.
                            Repercussions could be expected at the United Nations, where we
                            consistently have supported embargo resolutions. In general, we could
                            expect the issue to make more difficult in the short run our efforts to
                            exercise a moderating influence in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>Domestically, any exemption to the arms embargo policy would bring a
                            strong reaction from elements opposed to the South African regime. The
                            domestic economic effects, on the other hand, would be mildly favorable.
                            Although no thorough analysis is possible in the absence of more
                            information about the South African proposal, Defense informs us that a
                            moderate surveillance system would cost the South Africans about $125
                            million over a three to four year period and pro<pb n="189" facs="0228"

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>Our arms embargo toward South Africa pre-dates that of the U.N. Security
                            Council, and, as amplified by <gloss target="#t_NSDM_1">NSDM</gloss> 81,
                            has as its objective a careful balance between conflicting U.S.
                            interests in Southern Africa. It forms a part of our effort to maintain
                            constructive relations with South Africa, while responding to legitimate
                            Black African concerns (supported by a significant domestic
                            constituency) regarding South Africa.</p>
                        <p>A change in our arms embargo policy, particularly by supplying purely
                            military equipment would be a major shift in our posture toward southern
                            Africa. The change would come at a time when, with the independence of
                            Mozambique, the current Soviet efforts to influence the outcome of
                            independence in Angola, our efforts to convince South Africa to
                            facilitate independence in Namibia, and attempts at obtaining a
                            Rhodesian solution, we are increasingly engaged in southern African
                            affairs. Given these larger considerations, I recommend that you reject
                            the South African proposal, thus confirming our arms embargo for South

                        <p>The President has approved your recommendation that the U.S. accede to
                            the request of the Government of the Union of South Africa for
                            cooperation in ocean surveillance, to the extent of facilitating the
                            review of requests for export of equipment and data necessary to upgrade
                            the South African ocean surveillance system.</p>
                        <p>It is our understanding that International Signal and Controls
                            Corporation is prepared to undertake a study to determine equipment
                            requirements associated with providing South Africa with a modern ocean
                            surveillance capability. Under existing regulations, such a study would
                            require in all probability a Munitions Control license. It is further
                            understood that International Signal and Controls Corporation would
                            apply for specific license issuance for hardware items as subsegments of
                            the study were completed and approved. Accordingly, to implement the
                            President’s decision, the Director of the Office of Munitions Control is
                            authorized to invite International Signals to submit an application for
                            a study, informing the company that the U.S. will view sympathetically
                            but on a case-by-case basis, eventual export of reasonable amounts and
                            kinds of ocean surveillance equipment. The Office of Munitions Control,
                            in coordination with concerned agencies, will ensure that the study and
                            subsequent provision of equipment do not extend to capabilities which
                            would involve sensitive technology transfers or direct U.S.
                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>When the study is completed, Munitions Control will—again in coordination
                            with concerned agencies—review the final equipment requirements and
                            facilitate, as appropriate, additional license issuance procedures.</p>

                        <p>Implementation of the President’s decision to facilitate issuance of
                            licenses for South Africa to purchase ocean surveillance equipment is
                            proceeding apace. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HJ_1"
                                >Holloway</persName> dispatched yesterday (January 14) his letter to
                            South African General <persName corresp="#p_ARF_1">Armstrong</persName>
                            informing him that Munitions Control would view favorably an application
                            by International Signals Corporation for a license to study South
                            Africa’s ocean surveillance needs; <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>
                            is sending us a copy of this letter. Meanwhile, the Navy evidently has
                            been in contact with the South Africans, and International Signals has
                            informed Munitions Control that the study application would be
                            forthcoming by January 21. State is also taking steps to ensure that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG_1">Bowdler</persName> in South
                            Africa is informed.</p>
                        <p>One potential issue has arisen in relations between Munitions Control and
                            International Signals. The company was intending to do business with a
                            quasi-private South African organization which would be established by
                            the South African Government to put the ocean surveillance project into
                            operation. This procedure, broached by the South Africans in their
                            original letter to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HJ_1"
                                >Holloway</persName>, is evidently designed to save us political
                            embarrassment. More likely, however, it would do the opposite, adding
                            the appearance of cover-up to the political controversy which would
                            break out should our role in the ocean surveillance project become
                            known. State believes strongly and has told International Signals that
                            whomever the company deals with, the <pb n="192" facs="0231"
                                xml:id="pg_192"/>role of the South African Government must be
                            acknowledged in the study application—and therefore tacitly accepted by
                            us in approving the study. We concur.</p>
                        <p>You should also be aware that, despite extraordinary efforts at State and
                            Defense to restrict access to information about the ocean surveillance
                            project, the circle of those aware of it is inevitably widening. Aside
                            from State and Defense, International Signals and the South Africans are
                            now aware that a decision has been made to consider exceptions to our
                            embargo policy. We must assume that chances for a leak are becoming much
                            greater.</p>

                        <p>The study should describe current United States policy and the rationale
                            for continuing or modifying that policy, taking into account the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>—the economic benefits and costs of an Export-Import Bank policy change,
                            with particular attention to the extent of competitive disadvantage
                            United States business firms presently have in exporting to South
                            Africa;</p>
                        <p>—the short and long term consequences of a changed policy for overall
                            United States interests in Africa and elsewhere;</p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="0232" xml:id="pg_193"/>
                        <p>—the policies of other nations with regard to the use of government
                            export credit agencies for transactions with South Africa;</p>
                        <p>—United States policy toward South Africa and changes in that policy
                            implied by possible Export-Import Bank policy revisions;</p>
                        <p>—U.S. relations with other African countries and the effect of a change
                            in Export-Import Bank policy on those relations;</p>
                        <p>—the extent to which the present unstable condition in southern Africa
                            would be affected by a policy change;</p>
                        <p>—likely reaction within the United States to a change in United States
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the foregoing assessment, the study should evaluate
                            alternative United States policy options with regard to Export-Import
                            Bank loan policies in South Africa including pros and cons for

                        <p>The study should be prepared by an ad hoc group composed of
                            representatives of the addressees and the National Security Council
                            staff and chaired by the representative of the Secretary of State. Where
                            appropriate, a representative of the Chairman, Export-Import Bank should
                            be invited to participate in the meetings of the ad hoc group. Knowledge
                            of the study and participation in its preparation should be kept on a
                            strict need-to-know basis. Any additional participation should be
                            specifically approved by the Chairman of the Group.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize the results of the study,
                            and to obtain your judgment as to whether an <gloss target="#t_SRG_1"
                                >SRG</gloss> meeting should be called.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Background.</hi> This review was prompted in large
                            measure by intense lobbying, on the Hill and with domestic agencies, by
                            the Fluor Corporation. Fluor has obtained the overall design contract
                            for SASOL II, a $2.5 billion coal liquification plant which will satisfy
                            virtually all South Africa’s liquid fuel needs; Fluor argues that Ex-Im
                            loans are necessary if US firms are to win supply contracts for the
                            plant. We have emphasized in the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>
                            process, however, that we were not examining whether US firms should
                            participate in this project; they will participate significantly even
                            without Ex-Im direct lending. The task was rather the much broader one
                            of determining the economic and political costs and benefits of
                            permitting the Bank to extend its government-supported credits to
                            finance US exports to South Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Considerations.</hi> The study shows that the
                            economic benefits of changing the policy to allow Ex-Im direct lending
                            would be marginal. The shift would give US firms access to loans at
                            Ex-Im’s government-supported interest rate, making their bids more
                            competitive with the officially-supported credits of competitors.
                            According to the study, the change would increase US exports to South
                            Africa by $0–50 million per year over the current annual base of $1.3
                            billion. In <pb n="195" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_195"/>addition, SASOL II
                            would bring US firms $575–675 million in additional exports over five
                            years, even without direct lending; with direct lending this would
                            increase by $20–40 million per year over the five year period. These
                            figures are somewhat uncertain, since interest rates are only one of the
                            elements which go into the purchasing decision—also important are
                            service, delivery, down payment, grace period, duration of the loan, and
                            diversification of supply source among several industrial countries for
                            political and economic reasons.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Technological Considerations.</hi> One argument
                            advanced for changing our policy is that we need access to the new
                            technology which will be developed in the SASOL II project. Since Fluor
                            already has the overall contract for SASOL II, however, it will have
                            access to any new technology during the design, installation, and
                            start-up phases. Regardless of credit terms, US companies will almost
                            certainly be included in the diversified supply contracts for items of
                            technological interest, thus obtaining useful “hands on” experience. In
                            any case, South Africa has given US companies full access to the
                            predecessor SASOL I plant. (<gloss target="#t_ERDA_1">ERDA</gloss>

                            participation with Ex-Im loans is more persuasive. See Annex E of <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Importance of the Precedent.</hi> The change of Ex-Im
                            Bank policy appears to be more important in symbolic than in economic
                            terms. South Africa’s strong lobbying supports this view—since the goods
                            are apparently available more cheaply from other suppliers, South Africa
                            would gain no economic advantage from slightly improved US financing.
                            The symbol of liberalized policy, on the other hand, could be valuable.
                            Nor is it clear why Fluor, which already has the overall contract, has
                            expended so much effort on behalf of potential US subcontractors, unless
                            the company plans to deal with its own subsidiaries or anticipates
                            future financial benefits from helping the South Africans. All agencies
                            agree that Fluor’s lobbyists have greatly exaggerated the potential
                            economic benefits.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Political Considerations.</hi> In the absence of strong
                            economic arguments, political considerations must be determining.
                            Internationally, a decision to extend US government-supported Ex-Im Bank
                            lending to South Africa would risk alienating all those who disapprove
                            of apartheid. This would be particularly so in the wake of perceived
                            “cooperation” between the US and South Africa on Angola. There is little
                            most African countries can do by way of direct retaliation against US
                            investments or trade interests as a result, but there is no doubt that a
                            policy change would have a negative impact on our relations with the
                            rest of Africa. Nigeria is one example, where the undoubted adverse
                            reaction <pb n="196" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_196"/>could take the form of
                            retaliation with regard to crude oil supplies. Our best friends would
                            have to condemn the policy liberalization if asked.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Congressional Considerations.</hi> Any change toward
                            closer relations with South Africa will of course draw strong criticism
                            from those members of Congress who oppose apartheid. Ex-Im Bank must
                            notify Congress of any project larger than $60 million, and the Bank
                            candidly admits that even an individual Member could in effect block an
                            action by making enough noise. In this regard Congressman <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName> has sent a telegram to Ex-Im
                            questioning reports of a change in policy (Tab B). Ex-Im is also
                            concerned about the possibility of alienating Congressional support when
                            it is seeking increases in its overall program. Of course there are
                            other members of Congress who would support such a policy change, either
                            because of their political beliefs or because industry in their
                            districts would stand to benefit from increased exports. Ex-Im has
                            received several letters in support, including one from Congressman Dent
                            (Tab C).</p>

                            That we are reviewing our policy toward Ex-Im lending to South Africa,
                            which we tried to hold closely, has been in the press and is known in
                            Congress. A decision to change our policy would quickly become public
                            knowledge—Congress would have to be informed of Ex-Im lending to Fluor
                            in any case—and would have an adverse impact on the Secretary’s

                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Treasury</hi> opposes any change because the economic
                            benefits are not clear, and indicates that even if there were economic
                            advantages their position would be negative on political grounds.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Ex-Im Bank</hi> opposes change as Congressionally

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Bureaucratics.</hi> Because of the strong lobbying

                            might also reduce carping about the decision within the Administration
                            by emphasizing that it is being given high level consideration.
                            Alternatively, we could circulate the paper for official agency comment.
                            Agency positions would probably not vary from those already expressed

                        <p>2. Quote. Dear Tony: I want to express to you our deep concern in the
                            United States that South Africa might be suspended from membership in
                            the <gloss target="#t_IAEA_1">IAEA</gloss> or have its credentials
                            denied at the forthcoming 20th <pb n="200" facs="0239" xml:id="pg_200"

                                de Janeiro, the Group of 77 requested a review of South Africa’s
                                designation as the member of the Board of Governors from Africa. The
                                South African delegation’s credentials were not rejected until
                                September 1979, at the General Conference in New Delhi. (David

                            serious blow to our efforts to bring all South African nuclear

                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GVV_1">Garin</persName> said he wished
                            to welcome Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA_1">Johnson</persName>
                            back to Washington and had come to pay his respects.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary expressed his condolences on the occasion of the
                            earthquake which occurred in Portugal during the night. The Ambassador
                            said that fortunately there did not appear to have been any fatal
                            injuries in Portugal although there reportedly were some in Morocco. He
                            commented that it was fortunate that this quake had not been as
                            disastrous as the one of 1774 when some 40,000 persons were killed and
                            the city of Lisbon was almost completely destroyed.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GVV_1">Garin</persName> said that he had
                            followed relations between the United States and Portugal for many years
                            both here in Washington and while serving at the United Nations in New
                            York and he remarked that there were areas of disagreement between our
                            two countries, particularly in respect to Portugal’s overseas
                            territories. Noting that Portugal had its “three little Vietnams”
                            (Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea) which were smaller but,
                            nevertheless, bore some resemblance to the United States problem in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that enough years had now elapsed since the troubles
                            began in Africa to demonstrate clearly that this was not a spontaneous
                            revolt of the peoples in the areas but rather an externally stimulated
                            insurgent action.</p>
                        <p>In response to questions by the Under Secretary, the Ambassador said that
                            there was evidence of Chinese involvement, via Tanzania in activities
                            within Mozambique, including some very sophisticated weaponry. He said
                            that in Angola, guerrillas were infiltrating from Congo (K) and Zambia.
                            However, as both those countries need the Ben<pb n="202" facs="0241"
                                xml:id="pg_202"/>guela Railway for the export of minerals, they tend
                            to restrain the terrorists. In Portuguese Guinea which the Ambassador
                            said was the most dangerous, there were arms supplied (primarily Soviet
                            or East European) by the Republics of Guinea and Senegal.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he considered Portuguese Guinea a dangerous
                            problem for the entire Western world, because it seemed obvious that the
                            Soviets wanted to gain control of Portuguese Guinea and, subsequently,
                            at least one of the Cape Verde Islands. He commented that if he had
                            mentioned ten years before the fact that the Soviets would be in Syria
                            and Alexandria, nobody would have believed him, but they are there now.
                            In the same way, it might seem farfetched to envisage Portuguese Guinea
                            and the Cape Verde Islands as Soviet-dominated today, but this could
                            very well happen within a few years.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the Portuguese considered that with the Azores,
                            the Cape Verde Islands and Portuguese Guinea, Angola and Mozambique,
                            they were contributing significantly to the defense of the Western
                            world. However, faced with an enemy which was being supplied arms and
                            assistance from the communist countries, the Portuguese were denied by
                            the United States any military equipment to defend themselves.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">In 1961 the United States suspended military
                                shipments to Portugal on the grounds that Portugal was using arms
                                intended for <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> in its African
                                territories.</note> He said that they were even denied spare parts
                            for equipment acquired earlier and the average Portuguese could not
                            understand this and was bitter at such an attitude by an ally which it
                            had assisted. He concluded that he hoped there would be some change in
                            U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that he understood the Portuguese position and
                            asked how Portugal’s relations were with the new African states.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that Portugal’s relations with Malawi were excellent
                            as well as with Botswana and the other new states in southern Africa. He
                            said that relations with Zambia were tolerable, despite statements made
                            by President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and others.
                            He expressed the belief that relations with Congo (K) were better and he
                            understood that the Congolese had even raised the possibility of
                            reestablishing diplomatic relations. He said Portugal would be willing
                            to do so but had laid down certain conditions that had not yet been met.
                            He expressed the belief that there was no possibility of improving
                            relations with Tanzania. He said that he was convinced that the Africans
                            looked on the Portuguese differently, for example, than they did on the
                            South Africans (he added quickly that Portugal’s relations with the
                            South Africans were excellent although they disagreed on racial
                            policies). He said that in his years at <pb n="203" facs="0242"
                                xml:id="pg_203"/>the United Nations, he had felt that the black
                            Africans did recognize that the Portuguese were not racially conscious.
                            The Ambassador said that Portugal was proud of her achievements in
                            creating multiracial societies in Brazil, the African territories and
                            Goa which had remained attached to Portugal despite a great propaganda
                            campaign until India had sent in some 40,000 troops.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said he believed that Portugal must work for better
                            relations with the black African countries and that, with time and
                            patience, much could be achieved. In concluding, he asked the Ambassador
                            to convey his warm regards to the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Dr.
                            Franco Nogueira, with whom he had served in Japan many years before.</p>

                        <p>The Portuguese Foreign Minister thanked the President for seeing him and
                            for being so generous with his time at this moment when he faces so many
                            complex and critical issues. Before launching into bilateral matters the
                            Foreign Minister wanted to thank the President for addressing the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Council and explaining the <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM_1">ABM</gloss> question in such a persuasive,
                            convincing and lucid manner. Armed with this information <pb n="204"
                                facs="0243" xml:id="pg_204"/>the Portuguese Foreign Minister said he
                            would be able to explain to his government this problem which affects
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the whole world. The
                            President said that the credibility of the U.S. deterrent is of course
                            essential to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and the solution to
                            the problem depends precisely on our credibility on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Turning to US/Portuguese relations the Foreign Minister said that it was
                            no secret that these relations had not been very good after 1961
                            although he did not want to belabor this point. Now with new
                            administrations in the U.S. and in Portugal the time had come to start a
                            fruitful dialogue between both countries. Since 1961 there had been no
                            true exchange of communications between the two governments and this was
                            one of the reasons for the deterioration of relations. The President
                            asked whether the view that there had been no useful communications
                            between the two governments was generally shared by his government. The
                            Foreign Minister assured him that the feeling in Lisbon was that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had not been interested in
                            hearing the Portuguese view but he hoped all this was now over and that
                            there existed a new climate. The Foreign Minister said he wanted to make
                            two points.</p>
                        <p>1. He could assure the President that the Portuguese derived no pleasure
                            or amusement out of bad relations with the U.S. and moreover he did not
                            believe it would be in the U.S. interests to have bad relations with
                            Portugal. Therefore as a first step to improving relations there should
                            be a dialogue between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>2. As the President was certainly aware, the US/Portuguese difficulties
                            arose in the context of Portugal’s African policies. There were no
                            problems in other areas as U.S. and Portuguese views on European matters
                            and on the defense of the West largely coincided.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Africa, Portugal has followed a different policy than the
                            rest of the world. But he wanted to assure the President that Portugal
                            considered this policy vital. Moreover, it was not a personal policy of
                            former Prime Minister Salazar who has now disappeared from the political
                            arena. Portugal’s African policy remains unchanged because it fulfills
                            the needs and desires of the Portuguese people. This policy has been
                            carried out for many years and is supported by the vast majority of the
                            Portuguese. Finally, it was his view that Portugal’s African policy does
                            not run counter to the U.S. policy but that it is useful to the
                            long-term aims of the U.S. in Africa. This point is important and needs
                            to be discussed further and therefore we must have a dialogue. It was
                            his feeling that in the past the U.S. view had been much affected by the
                            general world position which was against Portugal and by <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> doctrine. He said he did not want to use
                            a harsh word but he thought the confrontation should end and the
                            dialogue should start. The President said he did not at all object to
                            the use of the word confrontation <pb n="205" facs="0244"
                                xml:id="pg_205"/>and that he was in favor of fair and tough
                            negotiations. The President assured the Foreign Minister that his was a
                            new administration with a completely open mind. He said he knew Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGW_1">Landau</persName> who had been dealing
                            with this area and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LGW_1">Landau</persName> in
                            turn clearly understood the President’s views. The President said that
                            we wanted the dialogue and that he did not want his administration to
                            continue using doctrinaire views. There were a number of important
                            questions to be discussed between the two countries. The President said
                            his first concern were the U.S. allies in Europe because what they do is
                            important to the U.S. He told the Foreign Minister that he could look to
                            our Ambassador in Lisbon as a channel and we would look to their
                            Ambassador in Washington to talk frankly with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGW_1">Landau</persName> and others or of course at any
                            time with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. This
                            was a new game and the U.S. wanted good hard-headed discussions, and
                            good relations with Portugal. The President asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGW_1">Landau</persName> whether the State Department
                            had already started something in this respect. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGW_1">Landau</persName> said that the Secretary has set
                            up a meeting for next week with the Assistant Secretaries for European,
                            African and <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Affairs to discuss this
                            matter. The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> for any additional views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for the important role Portugal has played in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. He said that in accordance with the
                            President’s wishes the National Security Council has ordered a study of
                            the Southern African problem<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2"><gloss
                                    target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss> 39, <ref target="#d6">Document
                                    6</ref>.</note> and that he hoped this complex matter would come
                            before the Security Council within the next two or three months.</p>
                        <p>In closing the Portuguese Foreign Minister said that he had found some of
                            the policies of its <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies hard
                            to understand because Portugal’s allies in the West had placed an
                            embargo on arms sales to Portuguese territories in Africa while at the
                            same time Portugal had a standing offer from the Soviet bloc for arms of
                            any kind and that the Czechs have been very actively offering arms sales
                            to Portugal. Talking about Czechoslovakia the President said he noted
                            with sadness how little public attention had been paid in the U.S. and
                            in Europe when it became apparent that the last vestiges of freedom in
                            Czechoslovakia had disappeared.</p>
                        <p>The President assured the Foreign Minister that Portugal would get an
                            opportunity to state its case and that it would have a fair hearing from
                            the U.S. He of course expected that Portugal would give the same fair
                            hearing to U.S. views. Meantime we would work on our policy review and
                            in closing he wanted to assure the Foreign Minister once <pb n="206"
                                facs="0245" xml:id="pg_206"/>more that he agreed with him on the
                            importance of a good dialogue between the two countries.<note n="3"

                                immediate future.” The Prime Minister did not believe that this was
                                possible due to outside interference. (Ibid., Central Files 1967–69,

                        <p>1. If and when a suitable occasion arises, the Department hopes you will
                            continue the exchange with <persName corresp="#p_CM_1"
                                >Caetano</persName> on the future of Portuguese Africa. In future
                            conversations, you may wish to draw on the following points which
                            represent the Department’s assessment of the current situation in
                            southern Africa and particularly the attitudes of Zambia and
                            Tanzania.</p>
                        <p>2. We believe the policies of Zambia and Tanzania, both militant African
                            states, reflect several factors: fear and suspicion deeply rooted in
                            their colonial experience that southern African whites represent a
                            genuine danger to their security; frustration over intractable internal
                            political and economic problems; and deep concern about forces at work
                            in the region which they are unable to control. Men like <persName

                                >Nyerere</persName> are indeed deeply committed to solidarity with
                            the African majorities throughout southern Africa. At the same time they
                                <pb n="207" facs="0246" xml:id="pg_207"/>have constantly emphasized
                            their belief in multiracial solutions in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>3. It is our feeling that the experience of the past decade, during which
                            relations between most of the black and white-ruled states of southern
                            Africa have steadily worsened, casts serious doubt upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName>’s expectation that a “better
                            time” will come while the Portuguese continue present policies. We
                            realize that the future of this area is fraught with uncertainties and
                            imponderables; nevertheless it seems most likely to us that the gulf
                            between the black-ruled states and Portugal is likely to widen, in the
                            absence of any attempt at reconciliation. Despite their internecine
                            quarrels and Portuguese military superiority, the insurgent movements
                            are active on more fronts and receive more Zambian and Tanzanian support
                            now than at any time in the past. Completion of the Tan-Zam Railway will
                            end Portuguese control over Zambia’s access to the sea, removing a
                            factor which has done much to moderate that country’s policies up to
                            now. From time to time, it is true that certain of the black-ruled
                            states may make pragmatic policy adjustments which favor Portugal (e.g.,
                            the Congo (K) at present). In the absence of some kind of modus vivendi
                            between the two sides, however, the long-term prospects for meaningful
                            progress do not seem promising. The Portuguese may be able to continue
                            to contain the rebellions, but the protracted conflict will continue to
                            drain Portuguese and African resources and will contribute to a
                            prolonged state of insecurity and tension in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>4. Such a situation is in no one’s interests. A continuation of the
                            present climate cannot help but provide increased opportunities for
                            communist influence. The current ability of the Portuguese to master the
                            situation may conceal the extent to which other long-range factors
                            (e.g., polarization of racial attitudes) will gradually undermine the
                            Portuguese position in Angola and Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>5. We believe there are many in Zambia and Tanzania who are aware of
                            these prospects for violence and are anxious to avoid them. The Lusaka
                            Manifesto, largely a product of Zambian and Tanzanian initiative,
                            appears to represent a genuine effort to find a peaceful way out,
                            without abandoning the basic commitment to self-determination. The
                            Manifesto, in which signatory states agree to urge cessation of
                            guerrilla activities if the Portuguese accept the principle of
                            self-determination, has now been formally and publicly endorsed by the
                            African Chiefs of State at the September <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> meeting in Addis Ababa.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> The Tanzanian and
                            Zambian leaders have privately emphasized to us the importance of the
                            Manifesto. Some have even expressed <pb n="208" facs="0247"
                                xml:id="pg_208"/>their recognition that evolution away from a
                            colonial relationship ought to be gradual and accompanied by intensified
                            measures to spur development of the African populations. Others are
                            doubtless much less flexible. Nevertheless, we have no reason to suppose
                            that the present leaders of these states would seek in any way to
                            prevent a multiracial solution in the Portuguese African
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>6. It is impossible to judge the ability of African states to deliver on
                            the promises in the Manifesto but we believe the Manifesto contains
                            positive elements which could provide Portugal with an opportunity to
                            determine whether the interests of the Portuguese on one hand and of the
                            African states and nationalist groups on the other, might ultimately be
                            reconciled. We believe that within the limits of their own needs and
                            commitments, the Zambian and Tanzanian expressions of a desire to
                            achieve a peaceful solution are genuine. We recognize Portugal has
                            publicly stated its eagerness to reestablish normal relations with its
                            African neighbors and believe the Manifesto may provide Portugal
                            opportunities to take positive steps in that direction, or at least to
                            test the willingness of African leaders to discuss the problem.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">FYI:</hi> In making these points, we have sought to
                            address two major aspects of <persName corresp="#p_CM_1"
                                >Caetano</persName>’s earlier assessment (Lisbon 1663). <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName> appears to see black racism as
                            the major motivation of the militant black states. We do not deny that
                            racism is a factor in their political dynamics, but as noted in
                            paragraph 2 above there are other important factors involved and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName>’s conclusion strikes
                            us as too pessimistic, or at any rate, as premature.</p>
                        <p>8. We infer from <persName corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName>’s
                            comments that he foresees a time when the emotionalism which currently
                            characterizes African attitudes toward these problems is likely to wane.
                            We have endeavored to explain why we believe the trends are generally in
                            the opposite direction.</p>

                        <p>In answer to the Secretary’s question on how he saw the future in Angola
                            and Mozambique, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM_1"
                                >Caetano</persName> stated that there were now fifth and sixth
                            generation Portuguese in those provinces. They were building a
                            non-discriminatory society based on a mixed race. This required time. If
                            independence could be granted to these provinces along the lines of the
                            American colonies in 1776 or of Brazil in 1822 there would be no problem
                            as far as he was concerned. However, the type of independence that would
                            satisfy the United Nations was a danger to civilization and would lead
                            to the implantation of communism in that area at great risk to Rhodesia
                            and South Africa. As happens in subversive wars, the problem was the
                            winning of the spirit of the people through economic and social progress
                            rather than the killing of the enemy. Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName> concluded by stating that the
                            Portuguese policy was to make the people realize that the assurances of
                            Portuguese sovereignty were worth more than the uncertainties of an
                            adventure with an unpredictable outcome.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he was pleased that Portugal had conveyed the
                            feeling to the outside world that there was some liberalization in
                            Portugal with the continued maintenance of stability. On Africa we hoped
                            to have a fairly practical policy in that we were going to assist
                            African nations in economic development and otherwise. We were not as
                            concerned about the extent of communist penetration as some other
                            nations seemed to be, since the danger compared to prior periods seemed
                            to have lessened. We did see a major problem in the years ahead of
                            confrontation between blacks and whites and this caused concern.</p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="0249" xml:id="pg_210"/>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he would like to suggest that we understood
                            Portugal’s problems and the Portuguese point of view. Just as we
                            intended to be very understanding of these problems and the steps taken,
                            he hoped the Portuguese would be understanding of the problems we faced
                            in the United States, the United Nations, and with other countries. We
                            would prefer to work out a future relationship in such a way that we
                            were not asked or made to appear to either support or oppose Portuguese
                            policies. He added that we were anxious to maintain cordial relations
                            and valued our partnership in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. We
                            certainly supported the direction in which Portugal was moving. Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM_1">Caetano</persName> replied that
                            while the United States should not have to commit itself to Portuguese
                            policy, there must be many concrete points where Portuguese policy could
                            be supported since these points were in support of world peace.</p>

                            Pope while Holden’s group was kept aside were very bad. This gave a

                            over <gloss target="#t_GRAE_1">GRAE</gloss> which was most unfortunate.

                            The US and other foreign countries were investing in oil and diamonds in
                            Angola and this represented encouragement for Portugal.</p>

                        <p>Recent evidence suggests the Soviets may be augmenting their support to
                            various liberation movements in austral and Portuguese Africa (or, at
                            least, may be contemplating such an increase). The margin of increase is
                            not likely to be great, but, even so, may give the various movements a
                            boost—especially if increased assistance takes the form of training
                            cadres in Africa.</p>

                            proceedings of the June 27–29 Conference in Support of Peoples of the

                            boiler-plate condemnation of the “colonial war” being conducted by
                            Portugal with the aid of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries, the final resolution called for a campaign of world-wide

                            increase in material aid to the liberation movements.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Altered Soviet Assessments.</hi> Such calls have been
                            voiced before and have resulted in very little in the way of
                            implementation. This may well be the case again. However, in the wake of
                            events in Libya, the Sudan, <pb n="213" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_213"
                            />Somalia and elsewhere, the Soviets appear to have become somewhat more
                            bullish in Africa and may be more inclined to give increased support to
                            liberation fronts. If so, they will probably be under no illusions as to
                            the fronts’ chances of near-term success; rather, they would see
                            stepped-up aid as a means to increase their own influence not only with
                            the liberation movements themselves but also with the progressive
                            leaders of independent African states who sympathize with them. With
                            such objectives in mind, an increased investment at this time would be
                            consistent with what the Soviets seem to have assessed to be an improved
                            climate in Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Competition With Other Groups.</hi> Moreover, augmented
                            Soviet assistance would enhance the position of the Soviet-supported
                            groups relative to those aided by the Chinese, or, in the case of
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName>’s group in
                            Angola, those supported by noncommunist sources. In the process, the
                            militant image of the Soviet Union as a supplier would also be improved.
                            That the latter may be a live factor in Soviet considerations is
                            suggested by the fact that the level of vituperation between the Soviets
                            and Chinese over precisely this point has recently increased. Judging by
                            their replies, the Soviets seem to have been particularly stung by
                            Chinese charges that Moscow is “obstructing the liberation struggle”.
                            Increased aid would represent one relatively low-cost, low-risk means to
                            counter such charges.</p>

                        <p>Angola is a Portuguese colony on the northwest extremity of
                            white-dominated southern Africa. Lisbon’s rule over the territory is
                            opposed by independent African states, particularly those on Angola’s
                            borders. These have supported a 9-year old nationalist insurgency in
                            Angola which, while thus far unsuccessful, shows no sign of abating.

                                xml:id="pg_214"/><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> relations with
                            independent Africa. At the same time, differences between the U.S. and
                            Portugal over the latter’s African policies have adversely affected our
                            bilateral relations with Lisbon.</p>
                        <p>Material U.S. interests in Angola are small, though growing. The
                            territory is important within the context of our concern with the
                            over-all southern African problem. Our policy objectives over the near
                            term should be generally concerned with the lessening of border
                            tensions, the development of local institutions with significant African
                            participation, the limiting of South African influence, and an increased
                            understanding of U.S. African policy by both black and white Angolans.
                            There is little we can do to attain these objectives except to try to
                            maintain some influence in Lisbon and in the black African states most
                            directly concerned. We should continue to remain outside the conflict
                            and maintain our arms embargo.</p>

                            continues to control tightly the political-economic life and
                            administration of the province. Internal right-wing pressures, led by
                            the military, to maintain the present colonial policy have apparently
                            precluded any significant <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy
                            changes in this area for the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>Although the US, like the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, treats
                            Angola as a non-self-governing area and thus feels Portugal has
                            international obligations under Article 73e of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter to promote the political,
                            economic, social and educational development of the territory and to
                            submit reports to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, Portugal
                            regards Angola as a “province” being an integral part of the Portuguese
                            nation. Unlike South Africa and Rhodesia, Portugal officially advocates
                            “multiracialism,” defined as the development of a completely racially
                            integrated society. Many centuries of neglect of the territory’s African
                            population as well as its present colonial status have, however, created
                            de facto white minority rule in Angola at least for the time being.</p>
                        <p>Many leaders of Angola’s 300,000 white community wish more economic and
                            ultimately political autonomy from the metropole. Both patriotism and
                            the realization that Portuguese military forces will be necessary in
                            Angola for the foreseeable future serve to mute the whites’ demands at
                            present, however.</p>

                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GRAE_1"
                                >GRAE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>, each of
                            these having a somewhat different tribal base. All three movements are
                            dedicated to the “liberation” of Angola from Portuguese rule. They
                            operate from neighboring African <pb n="215" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_215"
                            />countries and receive <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and/or
                            communist support. None of the insurgent movements has succeeded so far
                            in enlisting a significant number of Angola’s 5.2 million Africans, who
                            are largely rural and apolitical.</p>
                        <p>A largely expeditionary (although about 20 percent African) Portuguese
                            force of about 65,000 men plus white and native irregulars numbering
                            about 40,000 has succeeded in maintaining a military stalemate in Angola
                            over the past several years. African nationalist insurgents totaling
                            about 7,000 in the territory at any one time are active only in sparsely
                            populated areas of the east, the northwest and the borders of the
                            Cabinda exclave, all peripheral to Angola’s economic life.</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese have managed to neutralize most Africans in the areas of
                            active insurgency by resettling them in large controlled villages. As a
                            result, the insurgents have been forced to maintain long supply lines
                            back to their bases in Zambia and the Congo (K); this and their failure
                            to win the support of local tribes have been important reasons for the
                            inability of the rebels to penetrate into the more densely populated
                            central highlands.</p>
                        <p>The insurgent groups also continue to be plagued by internal and
                            intermural dissension. Nonetheless, the nationalist insurrection in
                            Angola shows no sign of abating and will probably continue to be a major
                            and costly security problem for the Portuguese for the foreseeable
                            future. (Portugal devotes about 38 percent of its budget to defense.)
                            South Africa gives the Portuguese some helicopter support in
                            southeastern Angola, but the Portuguese have sought to hold association
                            with South Africa to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic.</hi> With abundant agricultural and
                            mineral resources, the exploitation of which has quickened in recent
                            years, Angola’s economy is healthy and growing. The territory is one of
                            the world’s major coffee and gem diamond exporters, and iron ore and
                            petroleum extraction are increasing rapidly. Although defense spending
                            has limited governmental development efforts, the Angolan insurgency has
                            stimulated an increase in private investment and infrastructural
                            projects, as well as improvements in education and health facilities.
                            Angola’s principal economic problem continues to be its traditional
                            balance of payments deficit with metropolitan Portugal, a problem that
                            new mineral exports will ease but probably not eliminate in the near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations.</hi> All foreign relations for
                            Angola are handled by the central government in Lisbon. Civilian and
                            military intelligence officials of the province do maintain
                            quasi-diplomatic contacts with South African counterparts, and lately,
                            with officials from the Congo (K).</p>
                        <p>The Angolan insurgents’ Zambian safehaven has exacerbated relations
                            between that country and Portugal. Lusaka’s former sub rosa con<pb
                                n="216" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_216"/>tacts with Lisbon have been a
                            particular casualty of worsening tempers on both sides over the past
                            year.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>With the exception of Gulf Oil’s $150 million investment in an offshore
                            oil field in Cabinda, U.S. investment in Angola is miniscule. Investment
                            will probably increase, however, as mineral possibilities increase and
                            the territory’s expanding economy makes it more attractive as a market.
                            In trade, the U.S. is Angola’s second biggest supplier (after Portugal),
                            while buying about one-half of the province’s coffee production. The
                            U.S. took $54.2 million of Angola’s exports in 1969 while selling the
                            province $32.9 million worth of goods. Prospects for increased American
                            exports are excellent.</p>
                        <p>Angola occupies a potentially strategic position in the south Atlantic.
                            This is particularly so since the closure of the Suez Canal and the
                            prohibition on U.S. Navy calls at South African ports. The U.S. Navy
                            uses port facilities at Luanda and occasionally Mocamedes for refueling
                            on the average of once a month.</p>
                        <p>As part of the general problem of Portuguese Africa, Angola is a point of
                            friction in our relations with the black African governments and with
                            the Portuguese as well. Both sides are dissatisfied with our essentially
                            middle-of-the-road policy and this manifests itself both in bilateral
                            relations and in the U.N. In the latter case, the General Assembly and
                            the Security Council have called repeatedly on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> over the past decade to change its
                            colonial policy. In recent years, resolutions on Portuguese Africa have
                            become more extreme and the choice for the U.S. has often been to
                            abstain or to oppose them. This irritates the Afro-Asian group which
                            sponsors them, and makes it less willing to accommodate us on other
                            matters. An internationally acceptable solution to the Angolan problem
                            would thus serve our interests by removing an impediment to the
                            realization of more vital U.S. foreign aims, whether in Africa, in
                            Europe, or in other areas of the world.</p>
                        <p>Pacific and equitable long-term solutions to the problems of southern
                            Africa are in the U.S. interest. Events in Angola have considerable
                            strategic and political significance for the future of the region. The
                            continued operation of the Benguela Railroad is necessary to the
                            economies and thus the stability of Zambia (until the Tan-Zam Railroad
                            is built) and the Congo (K). A deterioration of the present uneasy
                            situation in Angola could lead to widespread and bloody racial conflict
                            in the territory. This might stimulate more South African assistance to
                            Portugal, extending Pretoria’s presence to the Congo River, and making
                            peaceful change in southern Africa even more difficult. Such
                            developments would increase African and domestic pressures for the U.S.
                            to actively intervene in the area, and would, in any event, make <pb
                                n="217" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_217"/>Angola and southern Africa more

                        <p>Realistic goals over the next five years would be the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Avoidance of becoming identified with either the Portuguese or
                            insurgent side.</p>
                        <p>2. Improved Portuguese communications and relations with Zambia and the
                            Congo (K).</p>
                        <p>3. A start in the development of local autonomous political institutions
                            with significant African participation. The successful integration of
                            increased numbers of Africans into the territory’s money economy and
                            urban life.</p>
                        <p>4. Limitation of South Africa’s influence to the extent possible.</p>
                        <p>5. Increased awareness by Angola’s black and white populations of U.S.
                            values, traditions, and foreign policy goals particularly as these are
                            reflected in our attitude towards Africa.</p>
                        <p>6. Implementation of our policy toward Angola so as to minimize, in so
                            far as practicable, adverse effects on our use of our base in the
                            Azores.</p>
                        <p>7. Maintain overflight rights and access to Port facilities.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>There is little that the U.S. can do to influence events in Angola. Our
                            policy should oppose Portugal’s use of force as a curative for its
                            African problems while stressing the belief that only moves toward
                            self-determination will promote long-term stability in Angola.
                            Corresponding with certain of the objectives listed above, the following
                            are possible specific <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> actions which
                            might make a contribution:</p>
                        <p>1. (a) Maintain the present embargo on arms for use in Portuguese Africa
                            by either side in the conflicts.</p>
                        <p>(b) Give public support to equitable, non-violent means of solving
                            disputes in Portuguese Africa.</p>
                        <p>(c) Continue the present policy of normal trade relations while neither
                            encouraging nor discouraging American investment in Portuguese Africa.
                            Investment guarantees can be considered on a case-by-case basis,
                            however, using the guidelines of 3 (b) below.</p>
                        <p>2. In Lisbon and Lusaka, continue informally to stress the advantage of
                            Portuguese-Zambian bilateral contact, and of avoiding recourse to the
                            United Nations in case of disputes.</p>
                        <p>3. (a) Continue to discuss informally the future of Portuguese Africa
                            with Portuguese officials.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Summary</p>
                        <p>Mozambique is a Portuguese colony bordered by both white and
                            black-dominated militant states. It is an important transportation hub,
                            but its colonial status and geographic position render it inherently
                            unstable for the foreseeable future. Lisbon’s rule over the territory is
                            opposed by independent African states, particularly those on
                            Mozambique’s borders. A nationalist African insurgency in its sixth
                            year, while thus far unsuccessful, shows no sign of abating. U.S.
                            association with Portugal as a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                            ally creates problems for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> relations
                            with independent Africa. At the same time, differences between the U.S.
                            and Portugal over the latter’s African policies have adversely affected
                            our bilateral relations with Lisbon.</p>
                        <p>While concrete U.S. interests in Mozambique are small, the territory’s
                            geography and transit facilities render it important within the context
                            of our concern with the over-all southern African problem. Our policy
                            objectives over the near term should be generally concerned with the
                            lessening of border tensions, the development of local institutions with
                            significant African participation, the limiting of South African and
                            Rhodesian influence, and an increased understanding of U.S. policy by
                            both black and white Mozambicans. There is little we can do to attain
                            these objectives except to try to maintain some influence in Lisbon and
                            in the black African states most directly concerned. We should continue
                            to remain outside the conflict and maintain our arms embargo.</p>

                            regards Mozambique as a “province” being an integral part of the
                            Portuguese nation. There is little separatist sentiment among
                            Mozambique’s 200,000 whites. Unlike South Africa and Rhodesia, as a
                            matter of national policy, Portugal does not discriminate on the basis
                            of race. The Government’s direction in Mozambique is rather defined as
                            the development of a completely integrated “multi-racial” society. Many
                            centuries neglect of the territory’s African population as well as its
                            present colonial status have, however, created de facto white minority
                            rule in Mozambique, at least for the time being.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss> liberation movement,
                            seeking an end to Portuguese rule, is conducting insurgent operations in
                            the territory’s extreme north and northwest. The movement operates from
                            the neighboring African countries of Zambia and Tanzania—but has not
                            been permitted to establish bases in strategically-situated Malawi. It
                            receives support from the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and
                            communist nations. <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>’s tribal
                            base is largely restricted to the fiercely independent Makondes near the
                            Tanzanian border; as a result, the movement has not found significant
                            support among Mozambique’s 7.8 million Africans, who are mostly rural
                            and apolitical.</p>
                        <p>Although <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>’s guerrillas
                            probably do not number over 5,000 in the territory at any one time, the
                            insurrection will probably continue to be a difficult and costly
                            security problem for the Portuguese for the foreseeable future.
                            (Portugal devotes about 38 percent of its budget to defense.) To date,
                            however, a largely expenditionary Portuguese force of about 50,000 men
                            (25 percent African) and some native irregulars have been able to
                            contain it. The Portuguese military effort has been supplemented by an
                            African resettlement program which has served to exploit tribal
                            divisions and thus limit the rebellion’s scope. Rhodesia’s Air Force
                            occasionally provides air support for Portuguese operations.</p>
                        <p>A major security concern at present is the insurgent threat to the Cabora
                            Bassa dam project in Tete district. Any <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1"
                                >FRELIMO</gloss> successes near Cabora Bassa could shake
                            international confidence in the project’s feasibility and possibly
                            endanger its completion.</p>
                        <p>With South Africa, Portugal has refused to observe <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> international sanctions on Rhodesia,
                            arguing that coastal states have an obligation to serve landlocked
                            neighbors. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>’s real concern,
                            however, is twofold: to protect the security of its African territories
                            while discrediting <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> economic sanctions
                            as a means to pressure the south<pb n="220" facs="0259" xml:id="pg_220"
                            />ern African regimes; and to protect income to Mozambique from transit
                            charges, which traditionally account for a major source of earnings for
                            the territory. By allowing Mozambique’s port and rail facilities to
                            continue to carry a substantial portion of Rhodesian trade with the
                            outside world, Portugal has become a major partner with South Africa in
                            support of the Smith regime’s defiance of the international
                            community.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic.</hi> Mozambique’s economy has been growing
                            modestly but steadily over the past decade. <gloss target="#t_GDP_1"
                                >GDP</gloss> is increasing about five percent a year at present.
                            Agriculture is the major activity and sugar, cashew, and cotton
                            represent the province’s principal exports. Transit trade from
                            Mozambican ports to South Africa, Rhodesia and Zambia also continues to
                            represent an important source of income despite Rhodesian sanctions.
                            Mozambique’s mineral resources are uncertain, although active
                            exploration for offshore oil is under way.</p>
                        <p>Although defense spending takes a large percentage of provincial
                            governmental expenditure, the Mozambican insurgency has stimulated
                            increased private investment as well as improvements in health and
                            education facilities. A number of new infrastructure projects are with
                            South African assistance at Cabora Bassa. Mozambique’s principal
                            economic problem continues to be a traditional balance of payments
                            deficit with metropolitan Portugal.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations.</hi> All foreign relations for
                            Mozambique are handled by the central government in Lisbon. Civilian and
                            military intelligence officials in Mozambique maintain quasi-diplomatic
                            contacts with South African, Rhodesian and Malawian counterparts.</p>
                        <p>The Zambian and Tanzanian insurgent safehavens have exacerbated relations
                            between these countries and Portugal; Lusaka’s former sub rosa contacts
                            with Lisbon have been a particular casualty of worsening tempers on both
                            sides over the past year.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>U.S. trade with Mozambique is small but growing; in 1969, the U.S. took
                            $16.3 million of the territory’s exports while supplying $26.5 million
                            of its imports. Mozambique is an important producer of the strategic
                            mineral columbo-tantalite, and the U.S. relies on the territory for
                            about 13% of its supply of this metal. American investment is
                            practically non-existent. Several U.S. companies are prospecting for
                            offshore oil.</p>
                        <p>Mozambique occupies a potentially important strategic position on the
                            Indian Ocean. The territory has a number of large deep-water ports which
                            have become more important with the closure of the Suez Canal. Because
                            our policy excludes U.S. Navy calls at South African ports except in
                            emergencies, the Navy makes heavy use of the facilities <pb n="221"
                                facs="0260" xml:id="pg_221"/>at Lourenco Marques for refueling. At
                            present, visits from U.S. destroyers or intelligence ships occur about
                            once a month.</p>
                        <p>As part of the general problem of Portuguese Africa, Mozambique is a
                            point of friction in our relations with the black African governments
                            and with the Portuguese as well. Both sides are dissatisfied with our
                            essentially middle-of-the-road policy and this manifests itself both in
                            bilateral relations and in the U.N. In the latter case, the General
                            Assembly and the Security Council have called repeatedly on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> over the past decade to change its
                            colonial policy. In recent years, resolutions on Portuguese Africa have
                            become more extreme, and the choice for the U.S. has often been to
                            abstain or to oppose them. This irritates the Afro-Asian group which
                            sponsors them and makes it less willing to accommodate us on other
                            matters. An internationally acceptable solution to the Mozambican
                            problem would thus serve our interests by removing an impediment to the
                            realization of more vital U.S. foreign policy aims, whether in Africa,
                            in Europe, or in other areas of the world.</p>
                        <p>Pacific and equitable long-term solutions to the problems of southern
                            Africa are in the U.S. interest. A deterioration of the present uneasy
                            situation in Mozambique could lead to widespread and bloody racial
                            conflict in the territory and bring South Africa and Rhodesia in as
                            active participants. Such developments would increase African and
                            domestic pressures for the U.S. to intervene actively in the area, and
                            would, in any event, make Mozambique and southern Africa more acute
                            foreign policy problems than at present.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. U.S. Objectives</p>
                        <p>Realistic goals over the next five years would be the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Avoidance of becoming identified with either the Portuguese or
                            insurgent side.</p>
                        <p>2. Improved Portuguese communications and relations with Zambia.</p>
                        <p>3. A start in the development of local autonomous political institutions
                            with significant African participation. The successful integration of
                            increased numbers of Africans into the territory’s money economy and
                            urban life.</p>
                        <p>4. Limitation of South African and Rhodesian influence to the extent
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>5. Increased awareness by Mozambique’s black and white populations of
                            U.S. values, traditions and foreign policy goals, particularly as these
                            are reflected in our attitude towards Africa.</p>
                        <p>6. Implementation of our policy so as to minimize, in so far as
                            practicable, adverse effects on our use of our base in the Azores.</p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_222"/>
                        <p>7. Maintain overflight rights and access to port facilities.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">E. Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>There is little that the U.S. can do to influence events in Mozambique.
                            Our policy should oppose Portugal’s use of force as a curative for its
                            African problems while stressing the belief that only moves toward
                            self-determination will promote long-term stability in Mozambique.
                            Corresponding with certain of the objectives listed above, the following
                            are possible specific <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> actions which
                            might make a contribution:</p>
                        <p>1. (a) Maintain the present embargo on arms for use in Portuguese Africa
                            by either side in the conflicts.</p>
                        <p>(b) Give public support to equitable, non-violent means of solving
                            disputes in Portuguese Africa.</p>
                        <p>(c) Continue the present policy of normal trade relations while neither
                            encouraging nor discouraging American investment in Portuguese Africa.
                            Investment guarantees can be considered on a case-by-case basis,
                            however, using the guidelines of 3 (b) below.</p>
                        <p>2. In Lisbon and Lusaka, continue informally to stress the advantages of
                            Portuguese-Zambian bilateral contact, and of avoiding recourse to the
                            United Nations in case of disputes.</p>
                        <p>3. (a) Continue to discuss informally the future of Portuguese Africa
                            with Portuguese officials.</p>
                        <p>(b) Consider applications for investment guarantees on a case-by-case
                            basis, taking into account the particular risks and the long-term value
                            of the investment to the indigenous inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>4. (a) In public statements in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                            elsewhere, distinguish Portugal’s racial policies from those of Rhodesia
                            and South Africa.</p>
                        <p>(b) To the extent possible, encourage any Portuguese moves towards more
                            association with Western Europe and independent Africa, and away from
                            South African and Rhodesian influence.</p>
                        <p>(c) Maintain friendly, cooperative relations with Portugal.</p>
                        <p>5. (a) Continue to supply <gloss target="#t_USIA_1">USIA</gloss>
                            informational material to the Consulate General in Lourenco Marques.
                            Maintain the small <gloss target="#t_CU_1">CU</gloss> exchange program
                            in Mozambique at its present level.</p>
                        <p>(b) Continue discreet contacts with Mozambique insurgent leaders to keep
                            abreast of possible grounds for negotiation.</p>
                        <p>(c) Continue to participate, preferably under an international umbrella,

                        <p>The Portuguese proposal, in mid-November, to hold discussions on their
                            African territories with independent African states is a step forward
                            from traditional Portuguese intransigence on this subject. However, such
                            discussions, if held, are unlikely to resolve conflicting views of
                            “self-determination and independence” for the territories. On November
                            15 the Portuguese Permanent Representative to the United Nations
                            proposed to African representatives—November Security Council President
                            Cisse of Guinea and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Representative
                            Sahnoun—that a “dialogue” be initiated in New York this January between
                            Portugal, the African countries (either singly or together), and/or the
                            Organization of African Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>).
                            The Portuguese indicated their readiness for ministerial discussions, in
                            the context of the principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter, over the following issues: 1) the situation in the Portuguese
                            African Territories—Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea; 2)
                            relations with neighboring African countries; and 3) general <pb n="225"
                                facs="0264" xml:id="pg_225"/>African problems. But, at the same
                            time, they emphatically ruled out discussions with representatives of
                            the liberation movements in the Portuguese territories. (On November 14,
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CM_1">Marcello Caetano</persName>
                            had publicly stated that Portugal’s national honor would not permit such
                            discussions.)</p>
                        <p>The Portuguese offer may have been only a tactical maneuver in
                            anticipation of the then-upcoming Security Council debate on the
                            Portuguese territories and in recognition of the strong African voting
                            position in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. Nevertheless, by
                            specifically including a discussion of the situation in the overseas
                            territories in the agenda, the Portuguese significantly broadened the
                            subject matter which they had previously been willing to discuss—usually
                            on a bilateral basis—only with a few African countries. Another new
                            development is Portugal’s willingness to talk with the <gloss

                            with a view to ending the present armed confrontation in the territories

                            independence. The original draft had specified negotiations with the
                            representatives of the liberation movements. However, after lengthy
                            consultations, the co-sponsors accepted the broader and more ambiguous
                            terminology. Whether negotiations will follow is still uncertain.</p>
                        <p>While the African countries still favor direct negotiations between

                            be found to bring the liberation movement representatives into the
                            discussions at a later stage. (From time to time there have been rumors
                            that the Portuguese have had secret contacts with some of the
                            insurgents.) Commenting on the <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>

                            reiterated Portuguese willingness to have conversations with “qualified
                            representatives” of African countries.</p>

                            dominance. Moreover, following the <pb n="226" facs="0265"

                            is in no position—even should he wish to—to challenge the conservative

                            Portugal’s continued retention and control of its overseas territories.
                            In his inaugural speech the President emphasized that defense of the
                            overseas territories was the principal task of the nation, taking
                            precedence “even over national economic development.”</p>
                        <p>Recent government statements, however, have noted a need to increase the
                            participation of the local populations in the affairs of the
                            territories. In October the Overseas Minister and the Governor of
                            Portuguese Guinea both made statements encouraging this development, and
                            on November 14 the Prime Minister publicly declared, “We are willing and
                            ready even to examine and increase the process of the participation of
                            Africans in local administration and government.” It is the prospect of
                            greater local African involvement, and its long-term consequences, which
                            the Portuguese apparently propose to discuss with the African
                            representatives in New York.</p>

                            approach could hardly satisfy the Africans, who have successfully
                            publicized the demands of the liberation movements for recognition and
                            independence this year. This publicity has included the following: In
                            January, the Security Council meeting in Addis Ababa (for which the

                            representatives of the liberation movements; in April, a three-man
                            special mission of the Committee of 24 (the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                            on April 25, 1974 was triggered by Lisbon’s African policies and the
                            divisions within the military to which they gave rise.</p>
                        <p>The leaders of the rebellion, who called themselves the “armed forces
                            movement,” are virtually unknown, but they are almost certainly

                            called for both a liberalization of Portugal’s colonial policies and a
                            restoration of domestic liberties, the rebel junta promptly called on
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName> to head their
                            movement. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName> accepted the
                            call, reportedly received an enthusiastic public welcome in Lisbon and,
                            according to the Portuguese radio, has been proclaimed “Head of
                            Portugal.”</p>
                        <p>Superbly organized and well-led, the insurrectionists took the government
                            by surprise. Loyalist forces offered only token resistance, and after

                            agreed after a few hours of negotiation to go into exile in the Madeira

                                corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName> promised to restore power to
                            constitutional institutions once a president of the republic has been
                            elected. <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName> can be expected
                            to run for the post.</p>
                        <p>Portugal’s most decorated war hero, <persName corresp="#p_SA_2"
                                >Spinola</persName> is also the author of a book which dared to say
                            that a military solution to the problem of insurgency in the African
                            territories is impossible and a political solution must be found.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName> also called for a new
                            Portuguese constitution to provide civil liberties and democratic
                            institutions in all areas administered by Portugal. The book created a
                            sensation in Portugal when it appeared last February. It led to a small
                            but abortive “march on Lisbon” in March, and the country has since been
                            gripped by coup fever. De<pb n="228" facs="0267" xml:id="pg_228"/>spite
                            Lisbon’s moves earlier this month to arrest various oppositionists, the
                            government apparently was unaware of the magnitude of the internal
                            threat it faced.</p>
                        <p>As “head of government,” <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName>
                            appears to be off to an auspicious start. His prestige is such that,
                            despite the divisions within the armed forces, he may be able to keep
                            them fully under control. The country, despite the influence of the
                            ruling oligarchs and the radicalism of some of the opposition elements,
                            may be ready for some modest movement toward change at home and
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">A reorientation of Portugal away from Africa and toward
                                Europe could be traumatic, although many African and European
                                countries would welcome such a change and allow time for it to take
                                place. Assuming the new government settles fully into power, we do
                                not expect to delay full relations with the <persName

                                coup would seem not to have put US interests in danger, and it could
                                possibly provide some near-term benefits for the United States—for
                                example, a possible lessening or end to Portuguese pressure for U.S.
                                weapons for use in the African territories.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus far there is little reaction to events in the metropole from the
                            Portugese territories of Africa. The local governments there are urging
                            business-as-usual. The rebel movements have not reacted publicly. They
                            will take a cautious approach to developments and to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_2">Spinola</persName>’s announcement he will seek a
                            political rather than military solution to Portuguese African questions.
                            The rebels consistently have demanded complete independence, something
                            they will not give up lightly. White settlers, particularly in Angola,
                            will be increasingly concerned about their own security. Rhodesia and
                            South Africa will face basic policy reassessments since Portugal’s
                            continued military effort against Mozambique insurgents has been seen as
                            a buffer for their own internal security.</p>

                            President? I am sorry for having had to postpone our meeting. As you
                            know, we have had some domestic problems to sort out and these have
                            taken much of my time. I understand you had a problem at the airport the
                            other day. I want to apologize for any over-eagernesses on the part of
                            our police. There is nothing to do about it now, but I am very sorry. We
                            will do our best to see that such discourtesy does not happen again.</p>
                        <p>Umba: Thank you for receiving me. I understand the unusual situation in
                            your country and I appreciate your finding the time to meet with me. The
                            incident you mentioned is now past. The relations between our two
                            countries are so friendly and important that any such incident cannot
                            possibly harm them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary (smiling): I am sure that nothing like that would happen to
                            me when I visit your country.</p>
                        <p>Umba: Oh, no. We would never let anything like that occur.</p>
                        <p>Umba: I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your
                            appointment. I would also like to express appreciation for the remarks
                            you made on Saturday to the African Ambassadors.<note n="2"

                        <p>I wish to raise two matters. The first concerns our bilateral relations.
                            We have noted that you met with the Belgians during a recent trip to
                            Europe. President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is very
                            concerned by Belgium’s efforts to discredit Zaire in the eyes of foreign
                            investors. The Belgians have carried on this campaign with a number of
                            other countries, including Germany, Japan and France. They have tried to
                            create the impression that my government is moving against all foreign
                            investments in Zaire. But their campaign has failed. Zaire has not
                            touched any Belgian assets or properties that were built with their own
                            country [<hi rend="italic">capital</hi>]. And we will never seize any
                            capital or properties in Zaire which belong to foreigners. We appreciate
                            the importance of foreign investments in Zaire: as much as $1.5 billion,
                            most of which is from the United States. Reynolds alone has almost $600
                            million invested in our country. President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> appreciates the confidence that the United States
                            has continued to place in Zaire. Despite Belgium’s campaign, the
                            relations between our two countries remain very good.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Our relations with Zaire are of very great importance to
                            the United States. We regard Zaire as one of the key countries in the
                            world and a king-pin in our policies toward Africa.</p>
                        <p>Umba: I now wish to move to the second question: the Portuguese
                            territories in Africa and Angola in particular. If we speak mostly about
                            Angola it is because it is so important to us. Zaire shares a common
                            frontier with Angola which is 2,000 kms. long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I did not realize the border was so long.</p>
                        <p>Umba: Moreover, there are now about two million Angolan refugees in
                            Zaire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>):
                            Two million? What is the population of Angola?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: About six
                            million.</p>
                        <p>Umba: I would like to speak frankly about independence in Angola. The
                            socialist countries—especially the Soviet Union—have shown a great
                            interest in Angola. They have put forth much propaganda in support of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Agostinho Neto</persName>, who until now
                            has been the leader of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>,
                            calling him the only true leader of Angolan liberation. Zaire, on the
                            other hand, has supported <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden
                                Roberto</persName>, leader of the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>. He is a genuine non-communist patriot. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> is a propagandist, a man of talk
                            and no action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What can the United States do?</p>
                        <p>Umba: We are concerned about the activities of the socialist states,
                            which are exerting pressure on the Portuguese to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>. Perhaps the United States could
                            assist us in our efforts to counter this pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="0270" xml:id="pg_231"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: But if you are supporting Holden, nobody is going to push
                            Zaire around for doing so.</p>
                        <p>Umba: That’s right. Holden is strong. Among the liberation leaders only
                            he is fighting rather than merely making propaganda. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> is in the process of being removed
                            from <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> leadership and now, at last,
                            other African countries are swinging their support behind Holden. Zaire
                            is not under any pressure to support Holden. If we do, it is because he
                            is serious—not an ideologist—and is fighting instead of simply engaging
                            in propaganda.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If you support one Angolan leader, and the communists
                            support another, I have confidence you will succeed.</p>
                        <p>Umba: As I said, others are beginning to understand the true
                            situation—that Holden is the most genuine of the liberation leaders. He
                            has recently been invited to visit Nigeria, Morocco and Libya.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What should the United States do?</p>
                        <p>Umba: We believe you should support <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden
                                Roberto</persName>. Since the socialists are behind <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>, and since it is said that Holden
                            is favorably inclined toward United States interests, we think he
                            deserves US support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How? From the practical standpoint, how would we support
                            Holden?</p>
                        <p>Umba: The communists are rushing to have their ambassadors accredited in
                            Lisbon and to urge support of <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>. The US could assist by helping to create pressures
                            in favor of Holden.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: My colleagues believe that foreign policy should be
                            conducted in reasonable ways. But I agree with you, sometimes if you
                            want to get something done you have to exert pressure. As for your
                            request that we support <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden
                                Roberto</persName>, frankly I have not been able to study the
                            problem. We think well of Holden, but I have not studied this matter
                            enough to know how something might be done. I understand your position:
                            Zaire has an interest in the future of Angola and you wish us to help by
                            supporting Holden.</p>
                        <p>Umba: One way this might be done is by raising the level of your contacts
                            with Holden.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Where?</p>
                        <p>Umba: That would of course be for you to decide. Here in the United
                            States or perhaps in another country. You would be in the best position
                            to decide.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I do not exclude this possibility. We will consider it. It
                            might be a good idea as the situation in Angola continues to evolve.
                            When we do so, we would let you know when we are doing it.</p>
                        <p>Umba: I have another suggestion I would like to make. We have helped
                            Holden a great deal. Even though we have military strength, in<pb
                                n="232" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_232"/>cluding Mirages, our means for
                            assisting Holden are more limited than those of the socialist states who
                            have been backing <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>. We think
                            there should be some way by which the US might help Holden to strengthen
                            his position as interlocutor with the Portuguese. He is of course
                            already the best qualified interlocutor.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We will have to look into this. Please assure President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> that any suggestions
                            he has will be studied sympathetically. Do you regard Holden as the only
                            viable, pro-Western candidate for leadership in Angola? Are there any
                            others?</p>
                        <p>Umba: No, not at present. Perhaps there are others who are not in
                            evidence now; but Holden is the only one we have so far been able to
                            identify. The <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> is, fortunately, on
                            its back. Holden and we share the same political views.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We have to look into this very carefully, now that the
                            Portuguese government has pronounced itself in favor of the principle of
                            independence for its African territories. We will study the matter
                            carefully. We always take President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s views into serious account. If he is concerned
                            about Angola, then his concern deserves our attention. When we have made
                            a decision, we will let you know. I am very sympathetic with the basic
                            principles you have expressed. We would appreciate your letting us know
                            what you think we can do. We will have a new Ambassador—<persName
                                corresp="#p_HD_1">Deane Hinton</persName>—in Kinshasa when you
                            return. I know him well; you can have confidence in him.</p>
                        <p>Umba: We will make sure that he is able to present his credentials
                            quickly.</p>
                        <p>Umba: I would like to make one more point: events can move quickly, and
                            the situation in Angola could very well move quite fast. It is important
                            that events not pass us by.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: You were wise to have come here. You have succeeded in
                            attracting my attention to Angola, much to the dismay of my colleagues,
                            I am sure. I will do something about it.</p>
                        <p>Umba: We hope that the United States may help the process of negotiations
                            on the Portuguese territories, and on Angola in particular, by
                            intervening with the Portuguese at the right moments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We will do that at the appropriate times. We will talk to
                            the Portuguese.</p>
                        <p>Umba: May I ask a personal question: how do you manage to master so many
                            problems at once?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I haven’t mastered this one yet. That is why I value your
                            judgment. I have great respect for your President and for his views on
                            African problems. Please convey my warmest regards to him. The interests
                            of our two countries have many parallels in Angola. We understand your
                            desire to have a friendly government on your border.</p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="0272" xml:id="pg_233"/>
                        <p>Umba: There have been reports that Zaire wants to establish itself in
                            Angola and Cabinda. These reports are jokes; they are false. We are
                            committed to the principle of a free Angola. We have plenty of natural
                            resources in our own country. We have no reason to harbor territorial
                            designs on Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I interpret your views to mean that, being a neighbor of
                            Angola, you want to see a government that is at least not hostile to you
                            established in Angola; that economic factors do not concern you; that it
                            is rather the human elements that count.</p>
                        <p>Umba: Before leaving, I would like to express appreciation for the
                            support you and the Department of State have given to our Ambassador
                            here in Washington. I am most gratified for your receiving me.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: May I assure you that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is always welcome in the United
                            States, and that President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                            attaches very great importance to the relations between our two
                            countries.</p>

                            cease-fire and the formation of transitional governments in Mozambique
                            and Angola.</p>
                        <p>An agreement with the Liberation Front of Mozambique (<gloss
                                target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>) was reached September 6 and
                            signed September 7 in Lusaka, Zambia. The principal provisions provided
                            for complete independence on June 25, 1975; the formation of a
                            transitional government, appointed by <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1"
                                >FRELIMO</gloss> and the Portuguese Government; and a formal
                            cease-fire. The transitional government was sworn in September 20.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations with the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>), the Popular Movement for the
                            Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>), and the
                            National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (<gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>), were hampered by continued
                            dissension among the leadership. A two-year plan for independence,
                            released August 10 by the Portuguese Government, proposed a coalition
                            government comprised of representatives of the liberation movements and
                            the white Angolan community. The Provisional Government would hold
                            elections for a Constituent Assembly that would draw up a constitution,
                            after which the Assembly would be dissolved. Elections would be held for
                            a Legislative Assembly, and a government representing the Angolan people
                            would be established.</p>
                        <p>The proposal was immediately rejected by the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>, and internal dissent within the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> threatened to fracture the
                            organization and dilute the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>’s
                            influence. A series of meetings, mediated by the Organization of African
                            Unity and various African leaders, enabled the groups to resolve their
                            differences. An official cease-fire agreement was reached with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> on October 14 and the <gloss

                                >UNITA</gloss> had already ceased hostilities June 17. All three
                            movements became legal political parties and established headquarters in
                            Luanda. On January 5, 1975, the liberation groups announced they had
                            established a united front, an important prerequisite for independence
                            negotiations with Portugal to proceed.</p>
                        <p>An agreement was signed January 15, 1975, between the liberation
                            movements and Portugal, providing for Angolan independence on November
                            11 and equal representation in a transition government that would take
                            office on January 31, 1975. A High Commissioner was appointed to
                            represent Portugal’s interests until independence. The transitional
                            government was responsible for organizing elections and drafting the
                            fundamental law, which would remain in effect until a constitution was
                            drafted. The agreement, signed at Alvor, Portugal, became known as the
                            Alvor Agreement.</p>

                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MV_1">Mwaanga</persName> came here last
                            August during the Cyprus affair and now President <persName

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: I am delighted to
                            have you here. I have been looking forward to this chat and to seeing
                            you this evening. I would be grateful if you would give us your comments
                            and views on the situation in southern Africa. It is an area which I
                            have not personally visited. At some time I hope to be able to pay a
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: May I express to
                            you my own personal gratitude and that of my colleagues and Mrs. Kaunda
                            for the wonderful way in which you have received us. Fortunately, we
                            have no bilateral problems and for this we have to thank our two
                            ambassadors. I think our bilateral relations are very good indeed.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: I would agree.
                            They are in excellent condition.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: The only
                            problems are in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: I understand you
                            have been working with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            and others to resolve the situation.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: As I told
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, we need
                            your help and I say this not in any critical way. I want to draw your
                            attention to future prospects in the area. For a long time, in fact ever
                            since 1966, we have been trying to urge greater attention to the area. I
                            believe the <pb n="237" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_237"/>U.S. and others in
                            the West should examine the problems in a search for solutions.
                            Otherwise, events may overtake you and the U.S. could find itself even
                            fighting on the side of the racists.</p>
                        <p>We in Africa fought for independence against colonialism. We did not
                            allow ourselves to be taken over. There was a buffer between us and the
                            communists. I have discussed this with your representative in Zambia
                            before the coup in Portugal. At that time I urged your country to
                            support the liberation movements in the Portuguese territories. I said
                            Portugal was your ally in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and an
                            ally against communism. But I believe you must examine the motivations
                            of liberation movements. They counted on the support of the
                            anti-colonials. This is an underlying and historical factor. I am not
                            apportioning blame. But I hope that you can see the right thing has been
                            done in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>As regards the leaders in Mozambique: The Secretary of State has just now
                            asked us in Zambia to speak to <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1"
                                >FRELIMO</gloss>. We will do this. I can tell you from our
                            experience that these Mozambicans want to be independent. They have been
                            helped by China and Russia, but they are no-one’s puppets.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: I understand they
                            want to be independent.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Other countries
                            supplied arms but <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss> fought
                            and achieved its independence. Angola gives us problems. I am authorized

                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> also agree?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: (laughing) Yes,
                            this time he does.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and I agreed to
                            seek the suggestions of President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> on Angola. We went to Kananga in Zaire. After all
                            the issues were laid out, we asked <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to brief us. He said he did not arm <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> to kill Angolans, but to
                            defeat colonial power and to bring peace to Angola. How do you see the
                            situation now, we asked <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.
                            What means exist for a practical solution? I was straightforward.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Are there three
                            major contending forces in Angola?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Yes, <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>. <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> was more or less on its own. We
                            did not support it, but we did not ignore it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Where did it
                            find its support?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: (rather vague)
                            On the outside. We almost ignored <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Jonas
                                Savimbi</persName>, the president of <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss>. Our colleagues had ignored <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> in the past, but this time he
                            emerged as someone who could save the situation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> would not accept <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                                >Roberto</persName> as president of a free Angola. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName> of FLNA would not
                            accept <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>. The only chance we
                            had of putting someone forward to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> with the possibility of acceptance was to suggest <pb
                                n="238" facs="0277" xml:id="pg_238"/>that <persName

                                >Roberto</persName> should each lead his party and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> would be the compromise leader
                            of all three.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do we know
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> personally?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJM_1">Wilkowski</persName>: Yes, I have
                            met twice with him for long talks.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you
                            think of him?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WJM_1">Wilkowski</persName>: He is a
                            very impressive leader and quite solid and does not strike me as being
                            self-serving or a loner.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: It was thought
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> could be the Prime
                            Minister or head the National Assembly. Or, for that matter, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> could be one or the
                            other. At least this is the way <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> proposed it. We had ignored <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> while he was fighting in the
                            bush, although he had made pleas to Zambia to recognize him. He said if
                            Zambia did not recognize him, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            would not recognize him either. He came out of Angola last year and we
                            changed our minds. We concluded that if we did not bring him into the
                            picture, he could cause trouble. Therefore, Zambia sponsored his
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and then we asked
                            him to come and talk with us. All of us in <gloss target="#t_UNIP_1"
                                >UNIP</gloss> were impressed with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>’s sincerity and his honesty of purpose. This
                            changed us overnight. We asked President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> to see him and also <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>. Both were impressed.</p>
                        <p>The new Portuguese Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo
                                Antunes</persName> was in Dar es Salaam. <persName corresp="#p_MS_2"
                                >Samora Machel</persName> of <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1"
                                >FRELIMO</gloss> asked us to see <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo
                                Antunes</persName>. He came to Zambia and told us he too was
                            impressed with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> said without <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> we would not have reached an
                            accord with the liberation movements for the transition of Angola to
                            independence. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> is a man of
                            humility and good qualities. All of us in southern Africa, including
                                <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>, are impressed with
                            him. This is our finding. He speaks freely and frankly and together we
                            are working for a solution in Angola. We realize it is not for us to
                            choose a leader of that emerging country. That is for the people
                            themselves to do. But Africa and its friends have no choice but to be
                            interested in Angola’s future. If not, the situation there is as South
                            African Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            said, “too ghastly to contemplate.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: It would be a
                            disaster.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: In the future
                            the people themselves can choose their leader.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Are there
                            substantial ideological differences in the area?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and its leader <persName

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And they are

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> is financed by Moscow. But, Mr.
                            President, perhaps I am taking too much of your time.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: I am very
                            interested. Please take the time.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: This whole
                            question is linked with Portugal. Angola cannot cut off its links with
                            the metropole. It is important for Angola. We would like to speak our
                            minds freely as Zambians, Zaireans and Tanzanians. I have been
                            authorized to speak for them and for Mozambique. We would like the U.S.
                            to understand Portugal. I will give you my own analysis for what it is
                            worth.</p>
                        <p>I first met <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> when he
                            was Minister without portfolio. When I recently met with him as the new
                            Foreign Minister I asked how he looked at <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo
                                Antunes</persName> said he was worried about <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> who was supported by the Communist
                            Party in Portugal, and because of this he could not support him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> further said
                            the Portuguese could not support <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> because he had repeatedly embarrassed them. He said
                            he would tell us he approved certain issues only to change his mind and
                            follow the communist line. For this reason, <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1"
                                >Melo Antunes</persName> said he would rather support <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> that we Zambians had the
                            same problem with <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>. Then
                                <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> said that
                            Portugal had a problem with <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>,
                            which did not seem to understand the new Portugal, but in time he hoped
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> would. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> said Portugal was not
                            chasing the Russians away—they would have an embassy. He said Portugal
                            could not follow a non-aligned course. At any rate, he anticipated that
                            Portugal would approach the U.S. to explain itself. I bring this up now
                            because of the tie-in with Angola.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Most of us did
                            not approve the tactics or the methods of the previous Portuguese
                            government, but now we do not want to see a big swing from the extreme
                            right to the extreme left. Frankly, it is difficult at this stage to see
                            where Portugal fits in. How soon do you think it will be before the
                            situation in Angola comes to a head?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: We must wait for
                            the general elections. It is difficult to say. We must see if the scheme
                            of a compromise candidate is accepted.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is <persName

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: <persName

                            leaked. We have not yet told <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>. We must convince him of the rightness of

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: As regards our

                            approximately $25 million for the former Portuguese territories, part of
                            which, at least $10 million I believe, is for Angola and Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do you

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I think we may
                            be given this task by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will you
                            report back in favor of <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: We have noted
                            that when the two opposing factions of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> and FLNA attack, the people run toward <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> forces. This is a good
                            development.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Do these groups
                            hold defined areas?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Yes, each of the
                            armed forces of these movements has definite areas. We are trying to
                            discourage this so as to unify them more.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MV_1">Mwaanga</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> is not a political lightweight.
                            He has grass roots support. He put forward a formula for bringing the
                            three parties together. Under the Albarge [<hi rend="italic">Alvor</hi>]
                            accord, each liberation movement or political party was to put forward
                            8000 troops for a total of 24,000. The Portuguese were to match this
                            with another 24,000 troops. If there is an election, there is a danger
                            of 8,000 loyal troops and 16,000 not loyal. The President (assumed
                            reference to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>) is
                            emphasizing the need for some formula to deal with this before the
                            election.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> supports <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>, does that eliminate the other two
                            in the elections?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Regardless of
                            the outcome of the elections, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> would be the President.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would the
                            other two groups accept this? Would they disarm if <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> takes over?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: There is need
                            for some ideas on how to form a national army.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Does Angola have
                            enough raw materials to be self-sufficient?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: It is a very
                            rich country.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is rich
                            in oil deposits in Cabinda. In fact some of its neighbors are keeping
                            their eyes on this. I am not suggesting you, Mr. President. If this is
                            an offense (humorously) our Ambassador will apologize to you.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: There are two
                            liberation movements in Cabinda, called <gloss target="#t_FLEC_1"
                                >FLEC</gloss>, one supported by Zaire and one by Congo
                            Brazzaville.</p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="0280" xml:id="pg_241"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is going
                            to be one hell of an election. There are a lot of refugees in Zaire who
                            have got to get back to vote.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MV_1">Mwaanga</persName>: We have a few
                            Angola refugees in Zambia. Cabinda is a problem that has created real
                            difficulties. All three liberation movements in Angola are agreed that
                            Cabinda is an integral part of Angola. We in Zambia support that
                            position.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Will they elect
                            members of Parliament also or just a president? It sounds like a
                            terribly complicated situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will you
                            keep in touch with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: He was in Paris
                            recently and he agreed to disagree with the French authorities who are
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_FLEC_1">FLEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Because of
                            oil interests in Cabinda.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> also had discussions with the
                            British.</p>
                        <p>Now I should like to talk about Rhodesia. Four countries (Botswana,
                            Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia) have all been pursuing a consistent
                            line in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> in support of the
                            Lusaka Manifesto which favors peaceful negotiations. But if these are
                            not possible to achieve a free people, then there will be a resort to
                            arms. It is not that we are going to fight; we want the opportunity to
                            negotiate. It is only if we fail in this regard. So far we have met with
                            some success and some disappointments. On the success side we have met
                            with South Africa Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> and other top leaders and with Rhodesian
                            liberation groups. Much depends on what outside pressure can be brought
                            to bear. We would like the memorandum which Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MV_1">Mwaanga</persName> left with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> last August to be followed
                            up by the U.S.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2"><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_MV_1"
                                    >Mwaanga</persName> on August 14, 1974. The two discussed
                                greater U.S. involvement in southern Africa and the need to repeal
                                the <persName corresp="#p_BHF_1">Byrd</persName> Amendment.

                            some of the work. We hope that when your pressing issues in other parts
                            of the world are resolved, you could have time to pay some attention to
                            southern Africa. We believe <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> will do what he has promised; that is pull out
                            his troops from Rhodesia by the end of May as he has said publicly, or
                            by the end of April as he said privately. This is a necessity. Once that
                            happens, we hope Smith will understand we are serious about negotiations
                            and a settlement, but we need pressure from those countries who also say
                            they want a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Namibia, we have told you we are grateful for the positions you
                            have taken in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in 1966 and in

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: What is that?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName>: That is, he
                            would like to isolate the blacks from the whites in specific areas for
                            separate development.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>: Are there many
                            tribes in Namibia?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Sufficient for
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> to create the
                            Bantustans. We hope you can pressurize him.</p>
                        <p>Regarding South Africa itself, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            position is clear. We have said that 3 million whites are Africans. If
                            they are not prepared to recognize this, then we must throw them into
                            the sea. We do not want to create an <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> army, but this year Uganda President <persName

                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (Jokingly)
                            If he had kept his Foreign Minister I would have negotiated with
                            him.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: These whites in
                            South Africa are Africans. They have to accept the challenge of being
                            Africans. They are not doing this. If there is an explosion it could
                            mean civil war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be
                            bloody. The South Africans are tough. It would be a disaster, which all
                            of us would rather avoid. There are Boers you know who fought hard
                            against the British.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: It would not be
                            confined to South Africa alone. South Africa has the ability to strike
                            all of Africa.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We should
                            all try to avoid this.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I hope you give
                            these issues your attention and study the implications. My task has been
                            to analyze the situation. We look for leadership on the question of

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MV_1">Mwaanga</persName>: President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> is not an advocate of
                            armed struggle, but peaceful change. Our whole position would be
                            weakened if the West and the U.S. do not support our stand. Change is
                            bound to occur in southern Africa but it will not be automatic. It needs
                            to be worked for to be achieved. A joint effort for peaceful change is
                            needed. In Rhodesia talks have been going on aimed at a constitutional
                            settlement. It would help if the U.S. said something about these
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are
                            making some representations to South Africa at this moment.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MV_1">Mwaanga</persName>: Our President’s

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can give

                            revolution. We have great sympathy for others who have followed along
                            the same footsteps toward freedom and liberty.</p>

                        <p>In accordance with an agreement reached on September 7, 1974, between
                            Portugal and representatives of the nationalist Front for the Liberation
                            of Mozambique (<gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>), the
                            Portuguese territory of Mozambique is to become fully independent on
                            June 25, 1975.</p>
                        <p>This country of 8.7 million people comes to independence after an
                            eleven-year guerrilla struggle against Portugal. <gloss
                                target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>, its principal liberation
                            group, now dominates a Portuguese-headed transitional government, and
                            believes that its efforts were largely responsible for ending
                            colonialism in all of Portuguese Africa. Much of black Africa shares
                            this view. In terms of our overall relations with Africa and of our
                            bilateral interests in the countries of southern Africa, I believe it
                            important that we establish diplomatic relations with Mozambique shortly
                            after independence.</p>
                        <p>Mozambique probably will be recognized promptly by most other nations,
                            and undoubtedly will apply for <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            membership soon after independence.</p>
                        <p>If you approve US recognition of Mozambique, I will seek an early
                            opportunity to notify the <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>
                            leadership of this fact and of our intentions to establish diplomatic
                            relations at the Embassy level.</p>

                        <p>The President has directed a study of United States policy toward Angola.
                            The study should analyze United States interests and objectives in
                            Angola in both the immediate and post-independence future. The study
                            should then project the possible ranges of political evolution in
                            Angola, both before and after independence, and propose options for
                            United States policies that take into account United States interests
                            and objectives.</p>
                        <p>The study should examine, among others, the following elements:</p>
                        <p>—The potential for increased civil strife, or civil war, in Angola and
                            its impact on the transition to independence;</p>
                        <p>—The relative political, economic and military strengths (and their
                            political orientation) of the three independence movements and their
                            leadership;</p>
                        <p>—The role of Portugal and neighboring African states, including South
                            Africa, as well as an assessment of likely efforts on their part to
                            shape the future of Angola;</p>
                        <p>—The extent of the involvement, past and future, of the Soviet Union and
                            China in political developments in Angola;</p>
                        <p>—The prospects for and likely pattern of economic development in Angola
                            and its need for development assistance or for aid in settling
                            refugees;</p>
                        <p>—Possible role of international organizations (e.g., <gloss

                            Angola headed by <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>, who is
                            receiving Soviet support. The latter also has Chipenda, who has broken
                            with <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>. What <gloss

                                >Not found.</note> suggests is that we give [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>] support to the second group—to

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said we don’t want
                            to make the same mistake we did in Chile—to give money to everybody and
                            then lose to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> said that the hope was
                            to get <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> to work together.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked who was best
                            for us.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>, <persName

                                >Hyland</persName> responded: <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                                >Roberto</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> added that his main
                            shortcoming was that he was not in the country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> said he went along with
                            help to <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>, but he was
                            concerned about the “spray tactics” in <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss>’s paper, proposing to give aid to several individuals.
                            We should realize that the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] would not be the end, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> would be back for more and want
                            arms. We are for <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and
                            believe that he will come out on top.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if all were
                            for <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>. He explained that
                            he had asked for papers from State, and instead of policy statements or
                            recommendations he only got a weeping response.<note n="3"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> acknowledged that there
                            was some division within the African Bureau, but that he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> had gone over this
                            recently and there was agreement that <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                                >Roberto</persName> was likely to come out on top.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said that if we
                            wanted <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> to win, why
                            didn’t we work with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>—he’s
                            ruthless and will get the job done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> said that it was the
                            Agency’s belief that he was erratic lately.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked what our
                            policy was. He explained that he had asked State for policy papers but
                            that they would not give him an opinion. He was of the impression that
                            they were saying not to do anything.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> said he thought that
                            might be the best course—that everything is going our way so we don’t
                            need to do anything.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said they don’t say
                            anything. We have <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> telling
                            us that <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> is going to win;
                            the Portuguese Left is backing <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>

                            not do anything and let nature take its course.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> said that was close to
                            his view. Angola is not of great importance.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said we can’t let
                            the Communists win there.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> said we were
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would not allow the
                            Communists to take over.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if we did not
                            care what happened in Angola. If we do, is [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] enough for <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>? And what else can we do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> said we could give
                            arms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> asked how.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> said through <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> said that our
                            diplomatic involvement is not to recommend help for <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>. Our diplomatic posture is
                            hands off.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> says that stands to
                            reason, but what does <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>
                            need and are we doing enough? Does he need our organizational help?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> said that if you are
                            talking about people, he would have to get them through <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>—that we should not try to use
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> asked if <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would know how to do it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> replied that he had
                            done it before and would be able to do it again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> said that what we have
                            now is a civil war.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said we would have
                            to take a position. What is going to happen in Angola?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> said that this fall
                            someone will be dominant, but that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> would not allow <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> to take over.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said we needed to
                            complete the <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d106fn4">Reference is to <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> said the issue was
                            whether we helped <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said we were
                            involved here. Didn’t someone tell him he would be welcome to visit the
                            U.S.?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName> said that he walked
                            into the Embassy and said he would like to come to the U.S. and asked
                            for arms.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said yes, but
                            didn’t someone tell him he would be well received here?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> said he doubted it. The
                            judgment is <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> versus
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> said the proposal
                            is to give money to <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> in
                            order to get into contact with him and to support <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> if we don’t want <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> to win. We need to finish the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM_1">NSSM</gloss>. If they took six weeks they
                            wouldn’t come up with anything different. Let’s get it in next week.
                            Then we can determine what our interest is. By early July we will have a
                            position.</p>

                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said he had appreciated
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>’s assessment of the
                            Angolan situation, presented during their joint meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName>, leader of the National
                            Front for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>), and that this assessment more closely corresponds to
                            the independent reports which <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> receives. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> said he believes that <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> leaders inside Angola are not accurately reporting the
                            situation to <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> no longer trusts
                            these reports. He said he was aware that <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> regularly briefed Presidents <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Julius Nyerere</persName> of Tanzania and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kenneth Kaunda</persName> of Zambia and
                            he, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, would like to be
                            included on these briefings. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> raised the subject of
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>’s failure to return
                            to Angola, saying that <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>
                            feared he would be assassinated. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> replied that if there are elections in November,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> must return to
                            Angola soon or face the accusation that he is a coward which will thwart
                            any election chances of the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that Johnny
                            Eduardo Pinnock, the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> Presidential
                            Council representative, had <pb n="250" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_250"
                            />tried to convince <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> to
                            return to Angola but without success. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> asked for <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>’s assessment of Eduardo, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> praised Eduardo’s leadership
                            abilities. (<hi rend="italic">Source Comment</hi>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> believes that <persName

                            replacement for <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> as the

                        <p>3. In discussing recent developments in Angola, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said he does not want a civil
                            war there. He believes that the Soviet Union would heavily support the
                            Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>) in a civil war. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> asserted that the Zairian economy cannot support
                            an armed struggle against the supply capability of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, nor does he believe that the West
                            would support the moderates in a struggle of this type. Therefore, a
                            civil war would probably bring to power a Communist government in Angola
                            which would be against the national interests of Zaire.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that although he
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> had had
                            disagreements, he believes that <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>’s initiatives are the best alternative to civil
                            war. He stated that <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> also believe in
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> as the only force
                            which can save Angola. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            said he wants regular contact with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> and that, although the Zairian economy is in
                            serious trouble, he would find some financial support for him. It was
                            then that <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> agreed again to
                            return to Kinshasa for regular meetings with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> said he would soon be able to advise <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> more specifically of the
                            support which the Zairian Government could provide. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> claimed he had terminated his
                            assistance to the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>; but said that
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> forces had been well armed by
                            the Chinese.</p>

                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> was pleased with the turn of

                                >Mobutu</persName>; however, he does not fully understand nor trust
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s motives. He will
                            probably again see <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            secretly during his 10 June visit to Kinshasa and believes that he will
                            be in a better position to assess <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s new approach to him at that time. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> suspects that there has been
                            some kind of a breach between <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"

                            under three categories:</p>
                        <p>a. Covert financial aid to <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>’s
                            principal opponents at a level matching that now enjoyed by <persName

                        <p>b. Covert political action to prevent civil war in Angola and advance a

                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> coalition. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>’s best chance of dominating Angola

                            into the Bakongo tribal area and then crush <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> militarily leaving the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> on top in Luanda and other key cities. By stopping the

                            and <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> seems to rest on too narrow a
                            tribal base (the Bakongo people) to win supremacy in Angola without a
                            more broadly based ally such as <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                            >UNITA</gloss>.</p>

                            to permit him, in the failure of efforts to end the fighting, to arm and

                            stocks with the assurance that the United States Government would

                        <p>2. Covert financial aid could be carried out in secrecy. Payments to the

                            could be made directly and with the recipients sharing an interest in

                                xml:id="pg_252"/>we might include advice on political, intelligence,

                        <p>3. Covert political action could include secret collaboration with

                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> individually to try to keep them

                                >Neto</persName> in Brazzaville. We could secretly seek <persName

                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> with political advice,
                            especially in helping him on the African and international stage. We

                            to stop the flow of arms to Angola and to encourage initiatives such as

                            Angola. We could also attempt to break off some of <persName

                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> through Brazzaville and to other
                            similar issues.</p>
                        <p>4. We have considered an effort to provide “covertly” weapons, ammunition
                            and improved training to match further escalation in the level of
                            fighting. Such weapons of both U.S. and foreign origin are at hand in
                            current stocks in sufficient quantity to match any likely needs in the
                            immediate future. Similarly communications gear and transport could be
                            readily found. Deliveries to the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>
                            or <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> would require an African
                            intermediary through whom to stage such help. Mobutu would no doubt do
                            this for the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and possibly the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> as well. In the event of
                            air delivery from the United States, however, security would be weak.
                            Such an arms flow to Angola would be quickly detected and publicized
                            with damage to the international standing and political prospects of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>. Similar side effects argue
                            against the hiring of mercenaries or the provision of aircraft. Unlike
                            the earlier Congo efforts, we do not have the umbrella of a legitimate
                            central government asking our help. Therefore, it seems more feasible to
                            encourage <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> to use his
                            existing stocks which could be replaced less conspicuously by sea
                            shipment.</p>
                        <p>5. Exposure of American arms aid to the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> through <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            would tend to spoil political efforts to get African leaders such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and Gowon behind efforts to
                            stop the fighting. And to stop the fighting remains very much to the
                            advantage of <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>’s
                            opponents.</p>
                        <p>6. The attached budget figures are very tentative and based on a force of
                            10,000 fighting men each for <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>. These strengths are probably
                            high for military combat action alone, but are based on the needs
                            expressed by both <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. In brief, covert financial aid and covert political action appear
                            feasible choices. Military aid can best be extended via <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and without American or
                            American-hired technical advisors if we are to keep any degree of

                            study analyzes the current situation in Angola and attempts to project
                            the future trends in the soon-to-be independent territory. It weighs US
                            interests and objectives, the involvement of other third countries, and
                            sets forth options on which United States policy could be
                            formulated.</p>
                        <p>The study finds the situation in Angola unstable, with continuing
                            factional strife between the contending nationalist parties probable.
                            The presence of Portuguese military forces and perhaps also the
                            recognition of the need to appear ready for independence have kept the
                            contenders from pushing the conflict to the point of full civil war. The
                            point of greatest danger in this regard will be immediately after
                            independence when the Portuguese forces are withdrawn and before the
                            government in power has had opportunity to consolidate its hold.</p>
                        <p>Neither of the major liberation movements, the National Front for the
                            Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>) or the
                            Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>) commands military superiority over the other. The
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> has been the stronger
                            throughout most of the period <pb n="254" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_254"
                            />of insurgency, but during recent fighting the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> has more often come out on top. The
                            third movement, The National Movement for the Total Independence of
                            Angola (<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>), is militarily much
                            weaker than either of the other two groups.</p>
                        <p>Of the three party leaders, the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>’s
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>, a Marxist poet, has the
                            greatest intellectual stature. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Jonas

                            appeared of late to be the most pragmatic and practical of the three and
                            is also reputed to be the most articulate and well-informed on current
                            events. The <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>’s <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> is an anti-communist and close
                            associate of Zairian President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>
                            refuses to go back into Angola from Zaire, where he has long lived in
                            exile. His prolonged residence in Zaire appears to hurt the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>’s chances.</p>
                        <p>Portugal’s primary objective seems to be to cut her losses and to get out
                            of Angola completely and as rapidly as possible. Neighboring African
                            states have provided financial and military assistance to the liberation
                            movements. For ideological reasons, Congo supports the Marxist-oriented
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, while <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has backed the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>. Both the Congo and Zaire have their
                            eyes on the Cabinda enclave, primarily because of its petroleum riches
                            and strategic location.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union has long backed the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>, and there is evidence it has lately provided the
                            movement with considerable new military equipment. China has had some
                            associations with all of the movements in the past, but is now most
                            closely associated with the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>, to
                            which it has supplied military equipment as well as some training.</p>
                        <p>Because of its important petroleum deposits and large coffee production,
                            Angola is one of black Africa’s richest countries. The country’s
                            agricultural potential is great—two-thirds of its arable land is not now
                            being cultivated—and significant deposits of other minerals add to the
                            promise of a bright economic future for the country. Angola will, of
                            course, need development assistance for many years to come, primarily
                            because it has such a small pool of trained manpower.</p>
                        <p>There may be a role for the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> or the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in promoting internal stability
                            in Angola or in helping resettle refugees, particularly with respect to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>’s efforts to move
                            three-quarters of a million Angolan Bakongo back into the country from
                            Zaire where they now live in exile. It should be noted, however, that it
                            is unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>—which strictly
                            avoids interference in the internal affairs of its members—will want to
                            take on the Angolan problem, and so far only <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> has shown any interest in appealing to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> for help with their troubles.</p>
                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and/or a <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> regime would be somewhat easier to
                            deal with than a <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> government and
                            would probably more readily encourage an interest in mutually beneficial
                            ties. Even so, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> are nationalists,
                            who would want to control (or even national<pb n="255" facs="0294"
                                xml:id="pg_255"/>ize) Angola’s resources, practice non-alignment,
                            and accept aid from all countries, and support Third World causes.</p>
                        <p>An <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> regime would probably try to
                            put the party’s socialist doctrines into practice. But practical
                            nationalists might postpone the application of some measures, since even
                            a socialist Angola might well accept foreign investment. Political
                            relationships would not be very cordial; we would probably have the
                            arms-length relationship we have with, say, Algeria or Somalia.</p>
                        <p>In spite of considerable press coverage in Angola, little public feeling
                            on the subject seems to have been generated in the United States.
                            Congress has shown some awareness of the situation in the former
                            Portuguese colonies as they approach independence and has appropriated
                            modest amounts of assistance for them. As yet there is no substantial
                            Congressional sentiment regarding US policy toward Angola. It can be
                            assumed, nevertheless, that there would be strong Congressional
                            opposition to any US involvement in support of one of the contending
                            factions.</p>
                        <p>The study presents three options for US policy:</p>
                        <p>—Neutrality, under which we would make no commitment of US prestige or
                            resources to influence the course of events in Angola.</p>
                        <p>—Active promotion of a peaceful settlement which, by reducing the chances
                            of a continuing armed conflict, would create a situation in which we
                            believe the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss

                            congratulate you upon your return to Mozambique, which will soon become
                            a new member of the family of nations. It is particularly opportune to
                            welcome the independence of your new country as we in the United States
                            approach the 200th anniversary of our own independence. As President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> said in his toast to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> during a White
                            House dinner on April 19, “We view the coming independence of
                            Mozambique, Angola and the island territories with great satisfaction.
                            The United States stands ready to help the emerging countries, and to
                            provide what assistance we can.”</p>
                        <p>I am also pleased to inform you, on behalf of President <persName
                                corresp="^#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, that the United States plans to
                            recognize the new government of Mozambique upon independence on June 25,
                            and to enter into diplomatic relations with it.</p>
                        <p>It has been our custom, in welcoming other countries to independence, to
                            close our consular posts in their countries and to establish Embassies,
                            subject of course to the concurrence of the new government. Subject also
                            to your concurrence, we would like to name an Ambassador to be resident
                            in Lourenco Marques. If you agree, the President would send the name of
                            his candidate to you for agrément. Upon your agreement, the President
                            would publicly announce his intention to nominate him to that post. As
                            required by our Constitution, the United States Senate would then be
                            asked to confirm the nomination. While we anticipate no unusual delays,
                            it will take some time to complete this process.</p>

                        <p>In order that we be represented in Mozambique from the beginning of its
                            nationhood, I therefore propose that our present Consul General, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPC_1">Peter C. Walker</persName>, be
                            accredited as Chargé d’Affaires, ad Interim, until arrangements are
                            completed for the arrival of our Ambassador. As you may know, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_WPC_1">Walker</persName> arrived in Mozambique
                            in July 1974.</p>
                        <p>The United States in turn would be happy to receive news of your plans
                            for entering into relations, and would welcome your initiative to
                            establish an Embassy in Washington and to accredit an Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to friendly and mutually beneficial relations between our
                            two governments and peoples. Best regards. Signed <persName

                        <p>The Secretary: I really have few instructions to give you—since I know
                            what I want. I don’t really care what <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>
                            thinks. I just want you to do what I tell you or there’s no sense in
                            your going.</p>
                        <p>I think we’ve mishandled <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            and the whole area. I have not given too much attention to it, so it’s
                            partly my fault. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> looks at
                            the Congo in 1960 and that [<hi rend="italic">then</hi>] what we’re
                            doing in Angola now where the Communist influence is greater than it was
                            in the Congo in <pb n="258" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_258"/>1960 and he
                            must conclude that we have written off the area. If we’re letting Angola
                            go, then in essence we’re letting him go. At least I think if he’s
                            rational, that’s what he’s thinking.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I agree completely. I
                            haven’t seen him in a year and a half but I agree.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If you add to that whole situation in Vietnam I don’t find
                            what he does incomprehensible. <persName corresp="#p_HD_1"

                            should stress first that we consider Zaire one of the two or three key
                            countries in Africa. Two, we consider him one of the two or three key
                            leaders in Africa. Three, we want to cooperate with him. Four, however,
                            we will not be pushed around. He will not win popularity by pushing us.
                            I want no handwringing, all right? Tell him my assessment of Angola. We
                            have been somewhat neglectful, and we would like his judgment of the
                            situation and what can be done, especially to support the non-<persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> groups. He and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> would have to take the front
                            row. We’d also be glad to send <persName corresp="#p_DLR_1"
                                >Devlin</persName> if he’d like to talk to him. It’s possible that
                            we can’t do it, but get his best judgment and come back and we’ll get
                            the President’s decision.</p>
                        <p>I want no wailing. By the way, thank you very much for skipping your
                            son’s wedding. It was a very patriotic thing to do.</p>
                        <p>Now do you agree with me on what we are trying to do?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Absolutely.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We slid into this mess. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> I think is a semi-savage, but I’m trying to see
                            it from his point of view. You can say that we gave <persName

                                amount not declassified</hi>] but he didn’t need money, but
                            strategy. Does <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> know
                            strategy?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: He’s pretty shrewd—if he’s
                            still rational and not too imperial.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Just let him and me get together (laughter).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: But if he’s still
                            rational, that is exactly how he has to read the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Make that point too—that we won’t be pushed. I won’t yield
                            on <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName>. He must understand
                            that. <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> will not follow
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD_1">Hinton</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Even a year and a half ago
                            he was lecturing us on Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: He was right. His foreign minister was here last
                                summer<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">See <ref target="#d99">Document

                            strategy of this building is to keep me from making any irrevocable
                            decision. They <pb n="259" facs="0298" xml:id="pg_259"/>were content as
                            long as we did nothing. Now I’ve made a decision, and I will get the
                            Presidential endorsement, though it may be too late.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I will add that I cannot
                            predict the outcome on this, though I think this will make us fairly
                            pregnant.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: In what way?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: To say we’re leaning this
                            way and then to say we can’t do it may be a problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What real choice do we have? If Angola is taken by the
                            Communists, what conclusions can the African leaders draw about the
                            United States. I know the <gloss target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss> bureau says
                            they care about economic aid, but there’s no empirical evidence for
                            that. I just don’t think African leaders really care about aid unless
                            they’re about to go bankrupt. They can only conclude that we don’t care.
                            Do you disagree, Joe?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: I’m not sure of the
                            judgment yet that the situation is leaning in the direction of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> coming out on top.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If not, this should tip it over. I think <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> will take Luanda.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: In effect he’s already
                            top dog there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I confess I didn’t focus on it early enough. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName> didn’t break his back getting
                            my attention, though.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: We’re a minority of two
                            in our bureau.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: S/P feels very strongly
                            about it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Your judgment then is that
                            hands off leads to <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>
                            winning?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I’m not in favor of the US involving itself, but in favor
                            of it making it possible for <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kuanda</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: The Africans are really
                            schizophrenic on this. They all say they want help for <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> but then they always talk about
                            having no outside interference in their affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I’m not sure we should switch to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>. I would like <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s assessment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: We double our chances I
                            think by throwing a few bones to <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: The resources required to
                            keep <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> out are considerable.
                            We should be showing political support and perhaps arms to both
                            movements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I’m not sure we should go in to achieve a total victory à
                            la Vietnam. What we are going to do is break the psychological back of
                            the non-<persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> people, since they
                            see no US support.</p>
                        <p>Forget for a moment how important Angola itself may be. I am concerned on
                            the impact on <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> when they see we’ve done
                            nothing.</p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="0299" xml:id="pg_260"/>
                        <p>Do it in the way which makes us the least pregnant, but most decisive.
                            Don’t dither around and lecture him on reconciliation. He must be puking
                            when he hears that kind of stuff, I know I do. I know it won’t come
                            about with reconciliation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: They will be issuing a
                            communiqué in Kenya today. That will be the latest so-called
                            reconciliation. Of course it won’t last long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Oh, I’m all for it. We shouldn’t break it, but we should
                            not kid ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Don’t push <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. Just tell him
                            we’ve had a rough year with other preoccupations. We want to know what
                            his analysis is and what he thinks. We could send <persName
                                corresp="#p_DLR_1">Devlin</persName> in if necessary.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: He’s there now. He’s
                            actually a resident of Kinshasa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Then we could still use him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: Well, we have used him in
                            the past.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: He personally may be
                            compromised at this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Well, you work it out. Are you leaving tonight? And when
                            are you getting back: I’m leaving on Friday<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4"
                                >June 27.</note>—will you be back by then?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Yes, we’re leaving
                            tonight. Will you be leaving Friday night?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: All right. We’ll try to be
                            back Friday morning.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD_1">Hinton</persName> should probably come back
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Well, he certainly should not be part of the
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: He wants a few days in
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Of course, he should do that. Tell him that he’ll get
                            another post, and that this is no reflection on him. Tell him to calm
                            down.</p>
                        <p>Well, I’m counting on you two.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: I think there’s an
                            advantage this time, since the last serious talk we had with the foreign
                            minister was last August and I believe after that he seriously mislead
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> thinking we were
                            already committed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It is important not to give him the idea that he can kick
                            us around and get an emissary whenever he needs domestic support.</p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="0300" xml:id="pg_261"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: One nice thing that might
                            come out of this would be to get the foreign minister out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Yes, he’s quite a guy—a

                            indication of the direction we are leaning.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Well, I must say that didn’t come through in the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: The last thing that he

                        <p>The Secretary: Well, what should we do?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I think we should give

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Several millions I think
                            and arms also given through him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Would he handle it?</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Would we send officers?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: No. I saw Holden too.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> says Holden’s
                            superiority has disappeared due to the heavy Soviet arms shipments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How quickly will we have to move?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Very quickly I think. The
                            strategy is if nothing is done by November 11 . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But do we have two weeks?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I think so. The stuff
                            should get into the hands of Holden and <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> in the next month or two.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How fast can <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            move?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: [<hi rend="italic">less

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: I think November 11 may
                            not be that critical either.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: My problem is I’ll be away for a week and I don’t want it
                            done while I’m away. We’ll turn it into a religious movement if that
                            happens.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: I can tip off the <gloss

                        <p>The Secretary: If we do it, we should not do it half-heartedly. Can we
                            win?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: They think it can be
                            done.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What’s your view?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: It would take a lot of
                            direct advice. I gathered that our minimum requirement is to avoid
                            having <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> take over.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: My disposition is, if we do it at all, we should try to
                            win. Can the Soviets escalate?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Not as fast as we can. We
                            have a continuous territority through which we can supply and they
                            don’t.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Should we try to involve <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I don’t know enough about
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s relations. <persName

                                >Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: They urged us to support
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>. I think we should
                            let them know we’re helping—but not in detail.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: My impression is that <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> was for it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: He’s now stopped arms
                            going through Zambia in an effort to deflate the situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said that any idea of the three
                            of them getting together is total nonsense. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> will succeed if the others are not helped.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Will <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> get
                            off our back if we help?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Well the air went out of
                            him each time I saw him.</p>

                            his Ambassador back to us?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I don’t know. He hopes
                            we’ll send a new one back out soon. I must say he never treated me in a
                            more friendly manner. When I arrived he was convinced that we were
                            involved in the coup and yet by the time I left he was pretty much off
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How was he in general?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: He’s as rational as ever
                            and, as a matter of fact, even less imperious.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How is his style of life? I imagine he’s suffering no
                            pain.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: No, he’s in no pain but he
                            is slightly less imperial.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What decision do we have to make now?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: We have to help them via
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> to get over his short-term cash
                            flow problem. Our people think this is reasonable. Second, we need to
                            increase the cash to the two Angola groups and put together a plan to
                            propose to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> of arms. It’s
                            not a huge amount of arms.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How are we going to get it done?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: When we discussed the

                            we found the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> already has on pallets
                            in warehouses a lot of arms and can get them moving in a matter of

                        <p>The Secretary: What’s the procedure for starting it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: One, we need the decision.
                            Two, who can run it? I think it would be disastrous to have it run by
                            the military. It should be the Agency. Then we need to get the right
                            guy—somebody like <persName corresp="#p_DLR_1">Devlin</persName>.
                            Conceivably we can take him back.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: I think so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I don’t know. He’s making
                            $100,000 a year.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That’s more than me! But anyway, someone like him.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: I think he might be talked

                            to ship arms but he’ll be talked to. I tell you this is a heroic phase
                            in US foreign policy. He just wants to give money because it will give
                            him less trouble with the Hill.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: Of course they can
                            purchase arms in Europe, fast, anywhere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: And we could ship
                            European weapons. They have warehouses in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Well, it’s nonsense. You’re not going to be fooling
                            anyone. He thinks [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        <p>All right, next week I want you to work with the Agency and defer the
                            decision until I come back. You should plan to go back to the Congo with

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: That should also

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: If you’re going to get
                            three C–130’s you might as well get six. I gather priority has also
                            already been given to the East Asian countries and I don’t think they
                            could handle more than six of them.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: You know with just cash

                            understand the difference in virginity between giving money and giving

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: They do need some money

                            will you brief us on Angola and related problems.</p>
                        <pb n="266" facs="0305" xml:id="pg_266"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Yes, sir. [Briefed—as
                            attached.]</p>
                        <p>The President: Cabinda was a part of the Portuguese territories? [This
                            was in reference to a point in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1"
                                >Colby</persName>’s brief as he described Cabinda.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>The President: What are the white areas within the borders of Angola?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: These are essentially
                            tribal, not military areas. These are additional tribes and I just chose
                            [pointing on the chart] to mention those three. They have different
                            languages and are different socially.</p>
                        <p>The President: Did the Portuguese do much in combatting illiteracy? Are
                            there many educated blacks?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: The Portuguese were
                            not forceful in this area. The literacy rate is between 10–15
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr.
                            President, until the coup, the Portuguese had no intention of leaving
                            their territories in Africa and didn’t organize them for
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_3">Schlesinger</persName>: Most of the
                            educated classes are in Luanda and support the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President: What is the white population?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Three to four hundred
                            thousand.</p>
                        <p>The President: Out of a total population of how many?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: About 5.7 million.</p>
                        <p>The President: Are these mostly white Portuguese?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>The President: Now, Henry, can you give us the options?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr.
                            President, I will be reasonably brief. This is an area where no one can
                            be sure of the judgments. I do question the judgment that control of the
                            capital is not of importance. The history of Africa has shown that a
                            nation’s only focal point is the capital, and whoever has the capital
                            has a claim on international support. In the Congo civil war, the reason
                            we came out on top is because we never lost Leopoldville. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> can get Luanda, and drive the
                            others out, he will have a power base, and gradually gain support of
                            other Africans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I agree, except to
                            note the importance of the (Benguella) railway and Zaire and Zambia’s
                            need for it.</p>
                        <p>The President: What is the name of the city at the end of the
                            railway?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Lobito. There is, of
                            course, always the possibility for fragmentation.</p>

                            wild agreement with. The first is neutrality—stay out and let nature
                            take its course. This would enable us to avoid a costly involvement in a
                            situation that may be beyond our control; protect us from some
                            international criticism; avoid tying us to any group; and avoid further
                            antagonizing the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. The probable
                            outcome would be that <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> would
                            establish a dominant position. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> might try to go with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>, or adjust to reality; Angola would go in a
                            leftward direction; and Zaire would conclude we have disinterested
                            ourselves in that part of the world and move towards
                            anti-Americanism.</p>
                        <p>As for the second course, my Department agrees, but I don’t. It is
                            recommended that we launch a diplomatic offensive to get the Soviets,
                            the Yugoslavs, and others, to lessen arms shipments to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, get Portugal to exert its
                            authority, and encourage cooperation among the groups. We could have
                            direct dealings with the Soviets or get African states to do it. If we
                            appeal to the Soviets not to be active, it will be a sign of weakness;
                            for us to police it is next to impossible, and we would be bound to do
                            nothing.</p>
                        <p>If we try to affect events, we could support <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"

                                >Savimbi</persName> with arms and money. If we move to arms

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is
                            need for money to increase the discipline of his organizations. The

                        <p>I am not against diplomacy, but you can do that only if you know where
                            you go if you fail. To launch a campaign against arms supply and not
                            know where you’re going afterward is an impotent policy. We would be the

                            the arms area? I don’t want to make a decision now, but I didn’t see any
                            proposals in the briefing papers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Forty
                            Committee has met twice to discuss the situation. The first meeting
                            involved only money,<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">See <ref target="#d102"

                        <p>The President: Is it <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s
                            recommendation that the effort of doing something is worth it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: There is great value
                            to aiding <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> through
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. The first is the
                            effect on Angola, and the effect on <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> himself. Assistance to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> could come in cooperation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President: At dinner he was very forceful on this. He said that it
                            was important to get his man in first, and then he will win the
                            election. I asked him if there were not going to be elections, and he
                            said yes, <pb n="269" facs="0308" xml:id="pg_269"/>and that was why it
                            was important to put <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> in
                            first and then he would win.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> was giving the President a
                            lesson in political science. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: While it would be
                            useful to give assistance, it would be matched by the Soviets and there
                            could be increased fighting and there would be no happy ending. I don’t
                            think we can put up a large enough sum to wrap it up quickly, and, with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s own present exposure, to get
                            away without a great deal of criticism.</p>
                        <p>The President: We can’t sit here and worry about six Committees if we do
                            what’s right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: What I’m worried about
                            is leakage and scandal in the present situation.</p>
                        <p>The President: It seems to me if you’re going to do something, you have
                            to do it in a meaningful fashion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: In answer, I doubt we
                            could have an immediate strategic effect.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the
                            reverse of that is that if we don’t do something they would be
                            suppressed.</p>
                        <p>The President: Once the Popular Movement takes over you can write it
                            off.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJ_3">Schlesinger</persName>: We might
                            wish to encourage the distintegration of Angola. Cabinda in the clutches
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> would mean far greater
                            security of the petroleum resources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, may I follow up—if we do something, we must have some
                            confidence that we can win, or we should stay neutral. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> is not a strong horse. The
                            fact that he stays in the Congo suggests he doesn’t have the tenacity to
                            win.</p>
                        <p>The President: It seems to me that doing nothing is unacceptable. As for
                            diplomatic efforts, it is naive to think that’s going to happen, and the
                            proposals on Portugal sound amateurish. I would like some re-study aimed
                            at doing something that looks at the levels of assistance, the speed and
                            the resources. [to <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>]: When
                            could you have that?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We could have that
                            next week. South Africa would like us to join with them in an effort,
                            but we can avoid the problems that would create and deal with the
                            blacks. Some would be encouraged for the US to take a role, and that
                            would activate them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I agree with this.
                            Doing something now and keeping the two parties afloat may well be
                            encouraging <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. Whatever
                            happens in November is not final, and it’s important to keep <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> viable and keep the options
                            open. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> some help and let

                        <p rend="center">ANGOLA</p>
                        <p>I. The current situation in Angola is highly unstable. Rivalry between
                            contending nationalist groups has featured increasing violence, with
                            each group trying to stake out territory and gain military superiority
                            before independence on November 11 and final Portuguese withdrawal by
                            next February.</p>
                        <p>A. The fighting over the past few months has been between the two largest
                            groups, the <hi rend="italic">Popular Movement</hi> for the Liberation
                            of Angola, led by <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Agostinho Neto</persName>,
                            and the <hi rend="italic">National Front</hi> for the Liberation of
                                An<pb n="271" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_271"/>gola led by <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName>. A third group in the
                            picture is the <hi rend="italic">National Union</hi> for the Total
                            Independence of Angola, led by <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Jonas
                                Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. In action early this month <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                            >Neto</persName>’s Popular Movement pushed the National Front out of
                            some areas north and east of Luanda, thus blocking the Front’s supply
                            lines into the capital.</p>
                        <p>2. Although there were some clashes in Luanda this month, the two remain
                            essentially in a standoff there.</p>
                        <p>a. Military control of Luanda by either group would necessarily not
                            determine control of or influence over the rest of Angola, particularly
                            in the rich agricultural areas or along all the main transportation
                            routes.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>’s National Front still
                            remains strongly entrenched in large areas of northern Angola where it
                            has substantial tribal support.</p>
                        <p>B. New fighting can erupt at any time:</p>
                        <p>—There is a continuing buildup of the military forces of all three
                            nationalist groups;</p>
                        <p>—Heavier weapons—mortars and bazookas—are being introduced into Angola by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and Zaire;</p>
                        <p>—Armed and undisciplined civilians are in Luanda on behalf of the Popular
                            Movement;</p>
                        <p>—Neither major group is able or willing to exercise effective control
                            over its own forces;</p>
                        <p>—All three groups are initiating military operations in parts of Angola
                            yet untouched by the fighting where no single group has an edge; and</p>
                        <p>—Politicking for the October elections for a constituent assembly will
                            increase tensions.</p>
                        <p>C. The oil-rich enclave of Cabinda remains a tinderbox. The Popular
                            Movement has a slight military edge there, but both other groups also
                            have forces active.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">All three</hi> want the enclave to remain a part of
                            an independent Angola.</p>
                        <p>2. The picture is complicated by the presence of a factionalized
                            separatist movement supported by both Zaire and Congo.</p>
                        <p>3. Both countries have endorsed Cabindan <hi rend="italic"
                                >independence</hi>, and any intensification of the fighting there
                            could bring outside intervention either directly or in support of the
                            separatists.</p>
                        <p>II. The transitional government installed last January has proved
                            unworkable.</p>
                        <p>A. It is constructed on a system of checks and balances, but in the
                            current climate members of the three liberation groups, as government
                            officials, concentrate on the competition between them.</p>
                        <pb n="272" facs="0311" xml:id="pg_272"/>
                        <p>1. Portuguese officials are not effective—they are caught in the
                            middle.</p>
                        <p>2. The liberation groups have not honored their commitment to establish
                            an integrated national army as called for in the independence
                            accord.</p>
                        <p>B. The 24,000 Portuguese troops are mostly kept in Luanda. They will
                            intervene in the fighting only to protect the whites.</p>
                        <p>1. The Portuguese have in effect abandoned most of the countryside to the
                            nationalists, and are already crating some of their heavy equipment for
                            shipment to Lisbon.</p>
                        <p>2. Portuguese forces are scheduled to begin withdrawal in October and are
                            to be totally removed by next February.</p>
                        <p>3. There is nothing in the independence accord to prevent the Portuguese
                            from withdrawing as fast as possible after October.</p>
                        <p>C. Lisbon’s policy insofar as it has one, is neutrality among the
                            factions.</p>
                        <p>1. Portugal wants to protect its important agricultural and mining
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>2. The Portuguese also want to be on good terms with whoever ends up in
                            charge after independence, but their ability to affect events is
                            diminishing.</p>
                        <p>3. At this point, the Portuguese leaders’ major concern is to prevent
                            civil war, which could have serious political repercussions in Lisbon.
                            They hope to avoid, for example, an increase in the number of white
                            refugees returning to Portugal who would add to the turbulence
                            there.</p>
                        <p>4. Thus, Lisbon can be expected to expend considerable diplomatic effort
                            to reduce tension in Angola, and would certainly welcome similar efforts
                            by interested third countries.</p>
                        <p>III. The role of outside powers in supplying military assistance to the
                            nationalist groups remains a key factor.</p>
                        <p>A. The <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union</hi> has been a long time supporter
                            of <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>’s Popular Movement,
                            providing both arms and cash during the years of the insurgency against
                            the Portuguese.</p>
                        <p>1. We are unable to determine how much Soviet military aid is <hi
                                rend="italic">now</hi> reaching the Movement, but it helped the
                            Movement score some of its recent gains.</p>
                        <p>2. Most of the aid is being channeled through Congo.</p>
                        <p>3. Soviet long-range goals in Angola are unclear, but in the short run
                            Moscow supports the Popular Movement in a situation where all three
                            nationalist groups are viable contenders for power.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Peking</hi> has had some association with <hi
                                rend="italic">all</hi> of the liberation movements in the past, but
                            the Chinese are most closely associated with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>’s National Front.</p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="0312" xml:id="pg_273"/>
                        <p>1. They have supplied military equipment as well as some training. Some
                            100 Chinese advisers may now be in Zaire working with the Front.</p>
                        <p>2. Chinese assistance has helped the Front to establish its forces firmly
                            in northern Angola.</p>
                        <p>C. <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> has had little success
                            in finding assistance elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>1. Zaire’s President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has
                            loose family ties with <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>
                            and has long supported him and the Front with funds, arms, and training.
                            He has also allowed <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> to
                            maintain his headquarters in Zaire.</p>
                        <p>a. Recently, however, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has
                            cut back his assistance to the Front, in part because of his
                            government’s serious financial problems and because he is cooling toward
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is alarmed over the
                            Front’s recent setbacks and feels <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                                >Roberto</persName>’s position has been damaged because he refuses
                            to leave Zaire and go to Luanda.</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> now believes <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Jonas Savimbi</persName> of the National Union
                            should be the primary figure in an independent Angolan government.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, of course, has some
                            serious concerns of his own.</p>
                        <p>a. Zaire is experiencing a severe foreign exchange shortage because of
                            the low price of copper on the international market.</p>
                        <p>b. He has now privately acknowledged that the US was not involved in a
                            recent coup plot, as he alleged, but may remain suspicious for some
                            time.</p>
                        <p>IV. The prospects for Angola between now and November are poor. Further
                            violence could take place and edge the territory closer to civil war. At
                            best, Angola will lurch along and become independent without a strong
                            leader.</p>
                        <p>A. The constituent assembly scheduled to be elected in October is
                            supposed to select a head of government of an independent Angola, but
                            new violence could force a postponement.</p>
                        <p>B. At a meeting in Kenya last week <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                            >Roberto</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>
                            reached what amounts to an uncertain truce that merely postpones a
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>1. They “agreed” to a number of measures, such as disarming civilians,
                            designed to prevent new fighting. Similar agreements in the past have
                            failed, however.</p>
                        <p>2. All three contenders seem to recognize the inconclusiveness of the
                            pact. They state that they will meet again to try <hi rend="italic"
                                >another</hi> form for the transfer of power if the elections are
                            not held.</p>
                        <p>V. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> independence, it now appears that no
                            single liberation group in Angola will have the power to impose its own
                            ideology as national policy.</p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="0313" xml:id="pg_274"/>
                        <p>A. If civil war is averted and the three liberation groups establish some
                            kind of coalition, the government’s policies probably will be a delicate
                            mix of the philosophies of the two major groups.</p>
                        <p>B. Both major groups want a non-aligned foreign policy and will seek to
                            maintain some balance between East and West.</p>
                        <p>1. The Popular Movement, if dominant, would establish a
                            highly-centralized and authoritarian one-party regime with a pronounced
                            socialist orientation and close ties to the communist world, with US
                            ties kept to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>2. The National Front would probably seek to establish a highly
                            nationalistic and personalized regime. Because of the Front’s rather
                            narrow political base, an <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> state
                            might be highly coercive. The Front would likely accept development
                            and/or military aid from the West as well as the East.</p>
                        <p>C. Both groups can be expected to nationalize Angola’s major productive
                            enterprises, but the Front probably would be more hospitable toward
                            selective Western investment than the Popular Movement.</p>
                        <p>D. As long as an independent Angola does not restrict access to its
                            transportation facilities, good relations with its neighbors Zaire and
                            Zambia probably can be maintained.</p>
                        <p>1. An independent Angola will give moral and political support to black
                            nationalists in Rhodesia and South Africa. It would probably not become
                            immediately involved in supporting insurgencies there, however, because
                            of distance and the dominant role now being played by Zambia, Tanzania,
                            and Mozambique in seeking a settlement with the Smith regime.</p>
                        <p>VI. If, on the other hand, protracted civil war develops, Congo and Zaire
                            could be brought into the conflict.</p>
                        <p>A. Civil war could also convince either one, or both to move into Cabinda
                            in an attempt to annex or neutralize the enclave.</p>
                        <p>B. Continued fighting in Angola would exacerbate the confrontation
                            between black and white Africa. It would intensify the fears of Rhodesia
                            and South Africa concerning black majority rule.</p>
                        <p>1. South Africa is particularly concerned that a communist or unfriendly
                            regime in Angola might support guerrilla activity in Namibia.</p>
                        <p>2. A hostile or unstable Angola would increase South African pressure on
                            us to support its domestic and international policies. This would
                            complicate our efforts to promote peaceful solutions to Southern
                            Africa’s racial problems.</p>
                        <p>3. South Africa does not seem to be planning any action to counter this
                            threat.</p>

                            that the Soviets and Chinese should take action, but the U.S. should
                            not. That’s what it comes down to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Our biggest asset is that
                            we are not involved militarily. We can go and say to Africans that we
                            are staying out and Africans can face up to the fact that it is the

                            doubtful that he will go along.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> saw him recently and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: I don’t believe we

                            the rest of you do, but I’ve visited this area and we can’t let the

                                >Mobutu</persName> there, and we should try to help him implement

                            reasonable expectation, then by God we should help him do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is a question of

                        <p>(To <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>) You’re sophisticated

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: He must know about the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: The Yugoslavs have given
                            $1 million; the Swedes large amounts. We don’t know what amounts the
                            Soviets have spent, but they have people there, armored personnel
                            carriers, etc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Let’s give dollars and let

                            keep Congress off our backs.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m surprised at you,

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: If you do go in, you
                            can’t use a program that will fail. That means massive intervention, and
                            I do not think we can stand the heat in Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Not if we just give money.
                            Let’s go the funding route first. I’m scared of the Congress on

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m scared of losing.
                            Is anyone else? Why would Zaire break with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and Yugoslavs if the U.S. will not give political

                            Where do we stand?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Disapprove.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Funds, but not arms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Do as quickly as

                            arms. We can guide them, if necessary.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Some of my staff argue

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If all the surrounding

                            the U.S. can and will do will be negative. If the <gloss

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Intelligence Brief—Angola—16 July 75</p>
                        <p>1. After almost a week of intense fighting in Luanda, the Popular
                            Movement for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>) has forced its rival, the National Front for the
                            Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>), to
                            withdraw from the city. The fighting may well have destroyed the fragile
                            six-month-old transitional government set up to lead Angola to
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>’s senior representative in
                            the transitional government, Johnny Eduardo Pinnock has announced his
                            resignation. Pinnock and a number of the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>’s leaders in Luanda have fled to Zaire.</p>
                        <p>3. During the fighting, the Zairian press announced that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Agostinho Neto</persName>, president of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, had been ousted by Major Nito
                            Alves, one of his major military commanders. Although <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>’s ouster has not been confirmed,
                            Pinnock said publicly that the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> is
                            now controlled by “extremists” who have taken over from <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>. With Pinnock, and perhaps
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>, out of the way, and
                            Front President <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName>
                            still apparently refusing to leave Zaire for Angola, the territory’s
                            transition to independence has been severely jolted, even though the
                            transitional government has been largely a facade during the more than
                            six months it has been in existence.</p>
                        <p>4. The Portuguese do not want their decolonization effort in the
                            territory open to charges that independence was given to one group by
                            default or by armed takeover. Lisbon will probably try to convince the
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> to return to the government.
                            The <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> is unlikely to return unless
                            the Portuguese can guarantee peace in the territory at least until
                            national elections can be held.</p>
                        <p>5. Pinnock’s resignation, which carried an acknowledgement that the
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> is mobilizing for full-scale
                            war throughout the northern part of the territory that it controls, was
                            probably designed in large part to prod the Portuguese into imposing a
                            truce through force of arms. Such a truce may be the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>’s best chance to pull itself
                            together. With the exception of a few small garrisons scattered around
                            the environs of Luanda, the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> is
                            now isolated in northern Angola, separated from <pb n="283" facs="0322"
                                xml:id="pg_283"/>the capital by territory controlled by the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. It is no doubt very low in
                            ammunition and supplies. Despite its threats, the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> seems in no position to wage
                            sustained war at the present time, particularly if it should try to
                            force its way back into Luanda.</p>
                        <p>6. It is probably too late for Portugal to guarantee security in the
                            territory. Until now, Portuguese military authorities have been hoping
                            they would not have to order the 24,000 Portuguese troops remaining in
                            Angola to intervene between the two hostile liberation groups because
                            they fear the very real danger that the troops would refuse. Lisbon is
                            also faced with the possibility that troops from Portugal proper will
                            refuse to go to Angola.</p>
                        <p>7. Portuguese Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1"
                                >Antunes</persName> rushed to Luanda but was unable to arrange a
                            cease-fire. He subsequently informed <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> that
                            Lisbon may have to take “emergency measures” in order to guarantee a
                            relatively peaceful transition to independence for the territory.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName> hinted last
                                Sunday<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">July 13.</note> night prior to
                            his departure for Luanda that Lisbon might have to appeal to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in order to protect the decolonization
                            process.</p>
                        <p>8. Whatever the Portuguese and the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>
                            may have in mind, the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> appears
                            determined to score a military victory against its competitors,
                            including the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
                                (<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>), the smallest of the
                            three liberation groups. The <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>
                            has refused to take sides in the fighting between its larger rivals but
                            on several occasions has been attacked by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. Zairian President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is
                            clearly in a quandary. Because of economic difficulties he has been
                            forced to cut back drastically on his substantial aid to the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> at a time when the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> has met serious reverses.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> strongly opposes the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and wants to keep <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> from becoming president of an
                            independent Angola. He probably has been seriously jolted by the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>’s poor showing in the latest
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>11. Prior to that fighting, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> was reassessing his relationship with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Holden Roberto</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> seems to have concluded that
                            the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> would be unable to win a
                            protracted war against its chief rival. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> apparently also believes <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>’s position has been damaged by
                            his long-standing refusal to return to Angola from Zaire. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> fears that he would be
                            politically embarrassed if he failed to match the personal popularity of
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Agostinho Neto</persName> on appearance
                            in Luanda and that he could even be assassinated.</p>
                        <p>12. According to reliable sources, <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> believes <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Jonas

                            ask for a concrete demonstration of U.S. support for his efforts to
                            prevent a takeover of Angola by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>. He is alarmed by the large influx of Soviet arms to
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and the defeat of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> in Luanda.</p>
                        <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> has also been
                            concerned about an <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>-dominated
                            Angola on his borders. There have been recent signs, however, that
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> successes may be causing him
                            to feel obliged to make some accommodation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to arms previously supplied to the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1"
                                >PRC</gloss> and Zaire, there may be deliveries of arms for
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and possibly
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> from other
                            countries.</p>

                            action. If the U.S. does nothing when the Soviet-supported group gains
                            dominance, I think all the movements will draw the conclusions that they
                            must accommodate to the <pb n="285" facs="0324" xml:id="pg_285"/>Soviet
                            Union and China. I think reluctantly we must do something. But you must

                                <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> from the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. We will provide you with the information you asked for regarding
                            transportation and other costs within 24 hours if possible.</p>
                        <p>2. I would suggest that you proceed as follows: first, put together a
                            package based on the highest priority items which is in the dols 6
                            million range. Bear in mind that political action and other programs
                            come out of that total, and <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>
                            estimates transportation can add 25–50 percent to cost. (Your figure of
                            dols 1,200,000 for 5000 M–16s is about half the cost our preliminary
                            estimates show. You should also consider cost of spare parts, etc.)</p>
                        <p>3. Secondly, put together a package based essentially on <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> program as reported in
                            Kinshasa’s 6798 and bring that back as well. In the meantime, we will be
                            costing it out. In any event, we will have to look quickly at both
                            programs and assess the impact.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has been given a [<hi

                            realistic. You should tell <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>, that if he has some other program in mind which
                            is realistic and offers prospect of success, we will consider it. You
                            should avoid getting into specific figures.</p>

                        <p>1. Following receipt <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>, I
                            telephoned <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and arranged
                            to see him again evening July 23. He invited me to stay for dinner with
                            the family, following which we had most useful talk on status of our
                            joint planning for assistance to Angola.</p>
                        <p>2. I told <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> that we had
                            reviewed and forwarded to Washington the list of equipment replacement
                            requirements given us by his generals as well as the categories of
                            equipment they had designated as being most urgently needed. I said I
                            had this morning received instruction reiterating the need to put
                            together a program not to exceed [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] although we did not exclude the possibility of
                            some additional assistance now. In explaining this limitation I observed
                            that our ability to help was subject to certain obvious considerations,
                            notably the limitation on funds available, the cost and time required
                            for shipment, and the risk of leaks that arises if large quantities of
                            matériel are sent all at once. I stressed the importance of the last
                            point, noting the need to move in such a way as to avoid exposure, which
                            could seriously harm our efforts to help. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> said he understood these considerations, but that
                            he considered that much less than the equipment from five of his
                            para-battalions (four for <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                                >Roberto</persName> and one for <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>) would not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss>
                            not redress the balance. He also reiterated his hope that the items
                            already sent Angola from his mobilization reserve as well as the key
                            items from his paratroops which we cannot supply in the present
                            emergency program would be replaced subsequently.</p>
                        <p>3. I said it was important that I provide Washington with as precise a
                            view as possible of his order of priorities within the broad priority
                            categories of equipment his generals had given us (on his instruction,
                            it is clear). This so we could determine the most useful types of
                            assistance both for a [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] program and for any aid we might be able to
                            provide above that. I then reviewed with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> the list provided by the generals and he
                            indicated how he would refine his relative priorities. His most urgent
                            need remains 5,000 M–16 rifles with <pb n="289" facs="0328"
                                xml:id="pg_289"/>one–two months’ ammunition, all of which he hopes
                            can be air shipped to Zaire as soon as possible. His second priority is
                            anti-tank guns to replace more than has already been shipped south to
                            counter the Soviet-supplied armored vehicles he said were having
                            devastating effect on the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> went on to designate
                            a number of other priority requirements from the list and indicated
                            which should be shipped by air and which by sea. We have incorporated
                            his views both in a [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] package and in a larger package which we have
                            developed as requested <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> [<hi
                                rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>4. In discussing Zairian military aid to Angola, I took the occasion to
                            remind <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> about US
                            restrictions on the transfer from one country to another of equipment (I
                            had in mind his paratroopers have some old <gloss target="#t_MAP_1"
                                >MAP</gloss> equipment.) supplied under <gloss target="#t_MAP_1"
                                >MAP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said he
                            understood this and reiterated his assurance that no US matériel, no
                            matter how old it might be, would be sent to Angola.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> commented on the
                            importance of moving ahead with political action programs, noting that
                            he had already instructed appropriate security and intelligence
                            officials to sit down [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] and start working up plans. In this regard,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said he had <persName
                                corresp="#p_AI_1">Amin</persName>’s assurance that, as chairman of
                            the forthcoming <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit, he would
                            see to it that the Soviets are appropriately taken to task at the
                            meeting for their intervention in Angola. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> intends also to work behind the scenes there to
                            encourage other such criticism.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> did not have much news
                            from Angola. However, he was concerned by reports that two more Soviet
                            vessels have delivered military equipment to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. I noted reports I had seen recently
                            reflecting adversely on the conduct of certain <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> officials and troops in Luanda. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> acknowledged this has been a
                            problem, and said he would admonish <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"
                                >Roberto</persName> again on this matter.</p>
                        <p>7. I told <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> that I intended
                            to return Washington July 25 and would press for earliest possible
                            decision. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> reiterated need
                            for urgent action. “The Soviets are continuing to send arms into
                            Angola,” he said, “while we are sitting here talking.”</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> As noted para 3, we are sending
                            separately the composition of two possible packages: one which meets the
                            current [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] ceiling,
                            and the other which incorporates <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName>’s most urgent minimum requirements and, according
                            our rough estimates, amounts to [<hi rend="italic">dollar amounts not
                                declassified</hi>] I wish to make clear <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> would not <gloss target="#t_rpt_1">rpt</gloss>
                            not regard what we could send under the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] program as enough to redress the balance in
                            Angola. As it is important that we start to move just as soon as
                            possible, I urge that Washington agencies give top priority to final
                            reviewing and costing out of both packages to permit a decision in the
                            next few days on what can be our highest level. I urge that the decision
                                <pb n="290" facs="0329" xml:id="pg_290"/>be in favor of a larger
                            than [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] dollar
                            program so that we will have a real impact on Angolan situation.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: I noticed that President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> has reacted in a way totally unpredicted by

                            that we’ll leak it. That’s inconceivable don’t you think? (laughter)
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] He’s
                            eager and he’s designated <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>
                            as the cut-out man.<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">As reported in telegram

                            this will be the reaction of the other Africans too. You guys have the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Well, as you know, I took

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: We have the figure of

                            know he would not see as enough—and I would agree with that.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: (handing the Secretary a
                            memo) We have this list also. This does not include anti-aircraft and

                        <p>The Secretary: Why does he need anti-aircraft?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: The Portuguese have
                            aircraft and they’re afraid it may be used against them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The first thing is, how much do we need?</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: My view is that if something is worth doing, it’s worth
                            doing right and the amount we put in will not increase the heat we
                            take.</p>

                            point—but it is crazy not to send arms. Who is backstopping this back
                            here? We’d better get Larry in here. (<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> is to send his arms
                            into Angola from his own stock. We can use the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"

                            It’s decided. Get that equipment in there.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Work it out with <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1"

                            has got money all right, but arms are more difficult.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That has been decided. At least let’s give <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: He thinks so. He’s moved
                            equipment for up to 5 battalions into Angola over the months and nine
                            armored cars during this last week.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Who is handling <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: He says we should take
                            Belgian and French equipment from the five battalions and give four to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and one to <persName

                        <p>The Secretary: Is there any reason not to do that?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: This will then replace
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It’s all below the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Let’s do it fast now that

                        <p>The Secretary: I agree, let’s do it fast and get an Ambassador in who
                            doesn’t get a heart attack when things get rough.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: Do I understand he’s
                            approved the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yes, and he’s only released [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: The other thing is, he
                            hopes we’ll replace what he’s given out of his mobilization reserve.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The major problem is to get it moving fast. Bob will you
                            talk to <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName> please?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: I can.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Now that it’s being done, it must be done fast.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: By air we can certainly
                            send in the urgent things.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName>: We could deliver the

                        <p>The Secretary: Then double the flights and do it in two weeks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>: That’s certainly fast
                            enough. He’s willing to take a small gap if he knows our stuff is

                        <p>The Secretary: Get him a message saying we’ve approved it and we’re
                            working out the details next week. What are you working on now

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My view is that they
                            can’t touch us on this. I don’t see how we can be faulted on what we are
                            doing. We are not overthrowing any government; we are not subverting
                            anyone. We are helping moderates combat Communist domination.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: That’s not my point. I’m
                            just worried about their own security standards.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Well, we’ll take a look at
                            that. Maybe they need better communications equipment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me make this
                            clear. We are in touch with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> and he is helping <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: He’s a good man.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: We have instructions out
                            to brief him, but no report back yet.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: No. Just a little
                            questioning. I start by telling what the Communists have sent and that
                            sets the scene. They ask what the U.S. interest is and I explain about
                            blocking a Soviet foothold.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Can’t we get some more
                            information out about what the Soviets are doing?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We are doing that
                            everywhere but in the U.S. It is up to you to get more done here in
                            America.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: What are you doing
                            about stopping offloading of Soviet cargo?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Well, we have generated a
                            lot of publicity and have made people more wary of helping move Soviet
                            material.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: What about the report
                            that there were two Czech ships ready to unload?</p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="0336" xml:id="pg_297"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: Our man can’t find those
                            ships. We suspect that it is not an accurate report.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, the work has
                            been done well. (To <persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>) Do
                            you want to weep about all this?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: No. Good. The problem
                            down the road, however, is who is going to be in charge—<persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s a problem I’d
                            like to face—get us to that point.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: We will have a problem of
                            answering critics.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m relaxed. The
                            Pentagon will have a problem—they can’t call me soft and hard at the
                            same time. They’ll have to make a choice. So what if critics attack us,
                            we can’t be faulted. What grounds would they use?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: They can claim that we
                            are perpetuating war by arming the people; that we will turn a civil
                            conflict into a bloodbath.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would they have
                            us do, abandon the country to the Communists?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: In my briefings on the
                            Hill I have said that we are on the way toward a coalition.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s not going to
                            happen. Our objective is to keep the Communists out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Even with our help, we
                            can’t be sure that the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> will be
                            defeated militarily.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Stop making that
                            statement. We don’t want to lose.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: The strongest argument
                            is resisting Communism.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: When I gave the usual
                            briefing it was to Sparkman, Case and Pat Holt. Senator <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName> a couple of days
                            later. Sparkman directed Holt to brief <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Clark</persName>. Holt made a written briefing sheet and evidently
                            distributed it to all the members.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Other members were there;
                            some were in and out, but Staff Member <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> was there, too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to complain
                            about that to Sparkman. We’ve gone down there on this for years. You
                            can’t give in to them. That won’t stop them. We’ll worry about the
                            political solution in Angola later. The Africans aren’t going to get
                            together in a coalition. There will be no coalition. That’s a pipe
                            dream. Show me one country in Africa where that has happened.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Sparkman has no

                            replace arms that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> has

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: Yes. Some of it will go

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName>: But American arms are not
                            to be transferred into Angola. The shipment will really be to help
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s not delay.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We do not intend to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName>: Your paper says you will

                            there. We have sent some American arms into Angola. We are drawing a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We have a problem with

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But Congress has been

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Confidentially, but if

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What does “expose”

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Publicly—if it became
                            public knowledge that we were sending American arms in.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And what would that

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: There would be a great

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: What we’d like to do is to

                            that the Soviets can do this, but the U.S. can’t. Then to say that

                        <p>1. As Secretary directed during your consultations here, we want you to
                            go back to <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName> on your

                            you that we increase our airlift of refugees from Angola, that before
                            reaching any decision to do so we frankly need some better understanding
                            than we have now on Portuguese policy and objectives in Angola. We leave
                            it to your discretion whether to make similar or supporting
                            representations to <persName corresp="#p_AJB_1">Azevedo</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. For your discussion, you already have available (State 199405)<note

                            will in future more <pb n="315" facs="0354" xml:id="pg_315"/>accurately
                            reflect stated <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy of complete
                            neutrality. You should indicate that in recent months it has seemed to
                            us that <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> more often than not has
                            departed from that policy. You should make clear that in our view a
                            policy of neutrality with respect to Angola dictates that Portugal take
                            steps to correct present posture which for example seems to be one of
                            acquiescing in delivery of Soviet arms to <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> and of pressuring <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> to come to terms with the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> at the expense of the former. We can
                            appreciate <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy of seeking
                            genuine accommodation among opposing factions in Angola in order to
                            facilitate peaceful transition of power on November 11. However, we
                            believe current <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy has amounted
                            to one of pressuring <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> to
                            come to terms with the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> on a
                            coalition arrangement, a policy that serves more to serve <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> objectives than it does to effect a
                            genuine peaceful transition of the kind Portugal professes to seek.</p>
                        <p>3. There follows our assessment of where we believe <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy has departed from one of
                            neutrality and from which you may draw for your conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Portuguese Assistance to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.
                            There is little evidence of direct Portuguese assistance to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> in the form of material support.
                            However, Portuguese actions—or, more often, the failure to take
                            appropriate action—have had the practical and sometimes intended effect
                            of assisting the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Arms Control. Admittedly, the small number of Portuguese troops in
                            Angola have been limited in their ability to monitor and control arms
                            shipments into the territory by all three liberation movements.
                            Nevertheless, even in those instances where the Portuguese were in a
                            position to take action, they have not. This is particularly true of
                            arms deliveries by air and sea to <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                            >MPLA</gloss>-controlled areas along the southern coast. For example, a
                            recent clandestine report indicates that a large shipment of arms was
                            delivered by a Soviet vessel to Porto Amboim south of Luanda in mid
                            August. According to the report, Portuguese military officials advised
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to use an inconspicuous route
                            in moving the arms, which included a number of armored vehicles and
                            tanks, to <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> bases near Caxito. The
                            weapons subsequently were used in the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>’s successful offensive to recapture Caxito on
                            September 6. It is impossible to determine whether such actions are
                            undertaken by local Portuguese commanders acting on their own initiative
                            or reflect the conscious policies of higher officials. In either case,
                            the result is the same.</p>
                        <p>6. Security. Portuguese actions have also assisted the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> in gaining complete military control
                            over the capital of Luanda. The deliberate policy of not intervening in
                            the fighting in the capital resulted in the gradual erosion of the
                            positions of both the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>. In early August, the Acting High
                            Commissioner forced the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> to sur<pb
                                n="316" facs="0355" xml:id="pg_316"/>render its one remaining
                            garrison at the Sao Pedro de Barra fortress, ostensibly to remove the
                            potential threat to shipping (specifically oil tankers) in the Luanda
                            harbor. Despite Portugal’s announced intention to secure a similar
                            withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> troops and to
                            “demilitarize” the capital, it has made no effort to do so.</p>
                        <p>7. Indirect Political Assistance. The unwillingness and/or inability of
                            the Portuguese to assure the safety of <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>
                            politicial officials in Luanda was a major factor leading to the
                            decisions by both movements to withdraw their representatives from the
                            transitional government. When the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            subsequently moved to take over the abandoned Ministries, Portuguese
                            officials voiced no objections. Later, in setting up the new
                            Directorates General to replace the Ministries in the transitional
                            government, the Portuguese High Commissioner relied almost exclusively
                            on <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and pro-<gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> appointees. Despite an announced
                            limitation on the authority of the Directorates General, the High
                            Commissioner has interpreted the decree in such a way as to allow the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> appointees to make major
                            policy decisions, such as assuming control of private banks and
                            insurance companies.</p>
                        <p>8. Diplomatic Activities. A number of high ranking leftists within the
                            Portuguese armed forces movement have been lobbying for some time, both
                            in Lisbon and with neighboring African states, for the creation of a
                            coalition government in Angola that would exclude the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>. Recognizing that any accommodation
                            between the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> is out of the question, these
                            officials hope that a nominal coalition of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> would at
                            least allow Portugal to claim the presence in Luanda of a government
                            representing a majority of Angolans when it withdraws from the territory
                            on November 11. That view now seems to reflect official Portuguese
                            policy for Angola.</p>

                        <pb n="317" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_317"/>
                        <p>1. Following a call by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MGS_1"
                                >McGovern</persName> on President <persName corresp="#p_CGF_1">Costa
                                Gomes I</persName> remained behind and spent 15 minutes alone with
                            the President to discuss Angola.</p>
                        <p>2. Told him <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was becoming
                            increasingly concerned about evolution of events in Angola. Under no
                            circumstances would we tolerate a Communist takeover there. While the
                            official <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy was one of
                            neutrality we had information that that policy was not being observed on
                            the ground. For example Soviet arms continued to arrive in Angola in
                            large quantities. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> had said it
                            was going to evacuate <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> forces from
                            Luanda, but that had not happened. No effort had been made to impede the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> military advances. We knew of
                            one occasion where Portuguese troops had actually facilitated a <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> military maneuver.</p>
                        <p>3. We also knew that pressure was being applied to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> to get him to join with <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. The US could not accept a solution
                            where Angola was turned over to the control of a group, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, which had achieved hegemony by the
                            naked use of force supported from abroad.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CGF_1">Costa Gomes</persName> replied that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> was criticized on all sides for
                            its Angolan policy. <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> accused it of
                            favoring <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>. Just recently in Bissau
                            at a meeting of the World Peace Conference the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> had attacked the “partisanship” of the Portuguese
                            forces. <persName corresp="#p_CGF_1">Costa Gomes</persName> said <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> had tried to bring the three parties
                            together. When Alvor Accord broke down, <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"
                                >GOP</gloss> appealed to neighboring African states for help. He
                            understood that the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> now intended to
                            send a goodwill mission. It was as hard to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> to sit together as it was to get the <gloss
                                target="#t_PCP_1">PCP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PPD_1"
                                >PPD</gloss> together in Lisbon, but <gloss target="#t_GOP_1"
                                >GOP</gloss> intended to keep trying. Their goal was to have a valid
                            “interlocutor” to whom to turn over power on November 11.</p>
                        <p>5. As far as arms were concerned, these were coming in to all the parties
                            from a number of sources. <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> had
                            received arms through Zambia. The <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>
                            had received French equipment and Chinese arms, as well as support from
                            Zaire. The Portuguese forces were essentially located at five points:
                            Cabinda, Luanda, Nova Lisboa, Lobito and Sa da Bandeira. They had very
                            little capacity to restrict the arms flow or impede military movements.
                            Some progress had been made in negotiating <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> troops out of Luanda.</p>
                        <p>6. I said I had to clarify to my government exactly what <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy was. Were they neutral or were
                            they favoring <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CGF_1">Costa Gomes</persName> said their policy was one
                            of neutrality, but <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> enjoyed
                            greater popular support than <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>
                            although latter had superior military capacity. He pointed out that
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> had had modern equipment at
                            the battle of Caxito. When I asked why they lost, he said because <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> forces have a better spirit and more
                            popular support.</p>
                        <pb n="318" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_318"/>
                        <p>7. I said that that was not exactly Washington’s understanding of the
                            respective support and military capacity of these two groups, but that
                            was not the essential point. Did Portugal intend to continue to allow
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to expand with the intention
                            of turning Angola over to it on November 11? <persName
                                corresp="#p_CGF_1">Costa Gomes</persName> claimed <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> was not Communist—it would be like
                                <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>, perhaps, but that in
                            any event <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy was to continue to
                            try to work with the three groups without showing favoritism to any.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CGF_1">Costa Gomes</persName> pointed to
                            yesterday’s (September 18) interview by Angolan High Commissioner
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> to the effect that
                            Portugal does not feel it has the legal right to hand over power on
                            November 11 only to <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, that <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> does not presently represent the
                            Angolan people and that <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> will
                            continue to try to unite the three movements.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> As usual <persName corresp="#p_CGF_1"
                                >Costa Gomes</persName> has any number of reasons for not taking a
                            strong stand, i.e., <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is accused of
                            partisanship by both sides (therefore it must be neutral), its military
                            capability is limited and <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> isn’t
                            really so bad. While I doubt <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> could
                            do anything significant to alter military situation if it wanted to, our
                            démarche may have an effect on the kind of political solution the <gloss

                        <p>1. I talked on September 24 with High Commissioner Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> about the politico-military

                                xml:id="pg_319"/>tuguese Government’s attitude would be toward an

                            independence.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> said he just queried
                            Lisbon on <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> policy with respect to
                            any attempt by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to take over
                            the country and was told that under no circumstances will the Portuguese
                            Government acquiesce in such a move. If the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> attempts a <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss> before
                            scheduled independence day on November 11, Portugal will stand fast. If
                            an acceptable political solution cannot be found by November 11 the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> must try and give jurisdiction
                            to the United Nations. If that body refuses to take a hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> said he may just stay on in
                            Luanda as the symbol of Portuguese sovereignty until a formula can be
                            found that will bring at least one other liberation movement into the
                            government. <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> does not
                            believe that <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> will attempt a
                                <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss> before November 11. The
                            Portuguese have intelligence to the effect that the Soviet Union told
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> about a month ago that a
                                <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss> now would not be politically
                            expedient.</p>
                        <p>3. If <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> does try to take over the
                            country, he said, he is confident that Portuguese troops will fight.
                            They do not like the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and their
                            antagonism is growing. <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName>
                            cited three reasons for this feeling. Firstly, whites here universally
                            blame the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and its “popular power”
                            groups for the ills that have befallen Angola. Although some of the
                            troops have little use for Portuguese colons, many of them have
                            relations and friends here and identify with their plight. The soldiers
                            who have been in Angola for some time have a different attitude than the
                            military in Portugal itself—they have seen the Angolan situation on the
                            ground and they definitely do not sympathize with the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. They are not pro <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> or pro <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss>, merely anti-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.
                            Secondly, the campaign of vilification by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>-controlled media in Luanda against the Portuguese
                            military has served to solidify the anti-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> feeling among the troops. Thirdly, when <gloss

                            arouse suspicion they were trying to draw the Portuguese into the

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> said there are now
                            20,000 Portuguese troops in Angola, 12,000 of them in Luanda, of which
                            6,000 can be classified as combat troops. By November 1, he said 9,000
                            of the troops in Luanda will have been withdrawn and the 3,000 that
                            remain will be specially selected for combat readiness. They will be
                            removed on November 10.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked about the defense of Luanda in the event of an <gloss

                            his troops to defend the city against <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> unless <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> withdrew
                            its forces from Luanda. <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>
                            promised to give him a reply within two days but to date <persName

                            troops, the world would be even more convinced of the myth that the

                            review Portuguese policy in Angola since April 25, 1974. Former High

                                >UNITA</gloss> in order to counterbalance the then overwhelming

                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> at that time, in military terms, was
                            on its knees, he said, and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> was
                            not even that far off the floor—it was prostrate. <persName

                            neutrality—treat all three movements alike and get involved with none of
                            them except to see that they all had what they needed to function
                            properly.</p>
                        <p>7. If any movement has been favored, continued <persName

                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. The High Commissioner said he sent

                                >Savimbi</persName> in which he pointed out that <persName

                            and he knows where <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName>
                            stands. He told <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> that if
                            he thinks he, <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName>, is
                            partial to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, he is completely
                            wrong.</p>
                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> is not helping the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName>, even though the <gloss

                            approximate those of the Portuguese military than either of the other
                            two liberation movements. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1"
                                >Melo Antunes</persName>, while on the left is a reasonable man who
                            leans toward the countries he has always been in the center and is
                            pleased to see the pendulum swinging toward him. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> added that after <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> drove both <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"

                            Luanda in July and August it began to assume charge of the entire
                            governmental apparatus. He said he went to then Acting High Commissioner
                            General Macedo, explained the danger and recommended that Macedo take
                            corrective action. It was then that Macedo took over the administrative
                            powers formerly reserved to the Presidential Council. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> said he cannot guarantee that
                            individual officers and soldiers do not help one or another movement—all
                            three have received such assistance, but these are actions taken on the
                            spot by Portuguese military and the movement they help depends upon the
                            circumstances and outlook of the officers involved and their perception
                            of the situation. He said that as High Commissioner his physical
                            location has a great deal to do with how people view his role: if he
                            were sitting in Carmona or Nova Lisboa he would most certainly be
                            accused of siding with <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="321" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_321"/>
                        <p>9. As far as he is concerned, he went on, his presence in Luanda allows
                            him to serve as a brake on the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.
                            He pointed out that he has taken over the visa issuing function
                            precisely in order to prevent the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            from slipping in foreign “advisors”. The only interesting cases that
                            have come to his attention are the applications of a French movie
                            actress and seventeen <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>-sponsored
                            applications for Cuban technicians in such areas as fishing, industry
                            and agriculture. He told the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> that
                            the number seemed excessive and he told me he plans to sit on the Cuban
                            applications for the duration. I asked about Russian advisors. He has
                            seen no visa applications since he took over the function, but he does
                            not know how many if any are in the country, nor does he have any way of
                            checking applications using phony passports.</p>
                        <p>10. In light of the charges made by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> that the Portuguese military
                            are handing over arms to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, I
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> what the
                            Portuguese do with their arms when they leave an area of Angola. They
                            take them with them, he replied. The only weapons that have gone to the
                            liberation movements, he said, were those that were given when the
                            movements seconded troops to the integrated forces provided for in the
                            Alvor Agreement. When the Portuguese left Malange and Luso they came out
                            loaded with arms, he said. <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>
                            unhitched the locomotive from the cars carrying the troops from Luso and
                            stole their weapons, but the point is the Portuguese do take all arms,
                            ammunition and vehicles with them when they pull out. They leave behind
                            office equipment, kitchens, bedding and other bulky items not worth
                            transporting. On independence the <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss>
                            will transfer to Angolan Government twenty-eight vessels and some old

                        <p>11. What about efforts to bring about an <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"

                            who could not find their way from Caxito to Luanda with a compass and a
                            road map. I realize that U.S. officials talk with <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> leaders and their supporters and that it is difficult
                            to obtain from the outside an appreciation of what is going on inside
                            Angola, but I hope all will keep in mind that <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> has the edge at this time because it is better
                            organized than its adversaries. Has received large amounts of weapons
                            from the Soviet Union and possesses capable leadership. The Portuguese
                            have had nothing to do with <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> gains
                            in recent months. For that matter, if it were not for the Portuguese,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> would still be
                            stumbling about in the bush with a few guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>13. I have known <persName corresp="#p_CAS_1">Cardoso</persName> since I
                            arrived here a little over a year ago and I believe him to be as neutral
                            as he says he is. Still, his job is to try and get Portugal out of here
                            on November 11, if he possibly can. The Portuguese want to leave with
                            honor and claim they will not submit to <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> demands. The Admiral’s idea of sitting in his chair
                            after independence like Sewell Avery is admirable, but the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> is likely to carry him out, and I
                            doubt the Portuguese will mind very much.</p>
                        <p>14. I trust no one in this drama—not the Portuguese, who have no will,
                            not the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, which has no scruples,
                            not the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> which has no sense and
                            not <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> which has no power, at
                            least for the moment. All of the factors driving the leaders of the
                            three liberation movements are negative—hate, greed, ambition—and the
                            final solution in Angola has to be by force of arms. The denouement will
                            come after independence and it will be bloody.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: Thank you. I am sure you

                            elections. I think the people will justify the confidence of the

                                amounts of Soviet equipment. We are very concerned that if the other
                                Africans see that the Soviet Union can be this effective such a long
                                distance away, it will affect the whole African situation, even
                                though Angola may not be directly involved. We therefore hope very
                                much that you will not make available to the <gloss

                                We are strengthening <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>

                                for civil war. But at a minimum we do not want the
                                communist-supported side to win, and this has certain parallels with
                                Portugal.” (Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, <persName

                            assistance to you, both for the refugees and to rebuild your
                            economy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: With regard to
                            participation of Communists in the government, the recent prolonged
                            crisis has revealed that the Communist Party does not represent the
                            aspirations of the people. In another vote I am convinced they would get
                            only 6–7%. The minor role they have in the government represents that
                            minor role.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate your announcement of economic help. We are very grateful.
                            But you should know that our needs are enormous—both as a result of the
                            past government and the recent revolutionary governments. I will be
                            talking to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            about this.</p>
                        <p>The President: We are pleased to be able to help. We plan to help further
                            with the evacuation of refugees, and I understand that this is on the
                            basis that you will not leave military equipment in Angola, when you
                            leave, for the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: We are very grateful for
                            the refugee assistance. It has been valuable, and anything you can do
                            will be a vital help in stabilizing the situation in Portugal.</p>
                        <p>I already told your Ambassador that we won’t help any of the factions in
                            Angola, so we won’t leave any equipment at all, based on our policy of
                            neutrality among them.</p>
                        <p>The President: We deplore the fighting. Is there any prospect of a
                            settlement prior to the independence date of November 11?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: As I said to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, our position remains in favor of a
                            conference of the three movements, together with us and representatives
                            of Africa chosen by the three, to settle the situation in accordance
                            with this conference. There should be a settlement which would provide
                            national unity and therefore there should be a government <pb n="325"
                                facs="0364" xml:id="pg_325"/>formed which can receive these powers.
                            This is our last effort in Angola, but I am optimistic now, even if a
                            political solution is achieved as a result of this conference. I think
                            civil war will continue.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you think <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> is a Communist?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: I think he is pretty
                            close, although it is difficult to classify him as an orthodox
                            Communist. We all are aware of the support he has received from the
                            Soviet Union and other Socialist countries, primarily from the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>The President: What about <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>?</p>
                        <p>[Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> leaves the
                            meeting at this point.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: In regard to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>, he has no solid political
                            background. He is easily corruptible and dependent on <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. Of the three factions I would
                            say <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> is the most
                            intelligent, the most able and the strongest politically. Some question
                            his political judgment. He has played on all sides and has switched
                            supporters from outside. I think he will end up losing popularity
                            because of these actions. But at the present moment he has considerable
                            support from Zaire and Zambia, while <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>, because of his bull-headedness, has lost some of
                            that support.</p>
                        <p>The President: They have all been involved in decolonization?</p>

                        <p>The President: With the refugees leaving, do they have the capability of
                            running the economy?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: From what I know of
                            Angola—and I am familiar with it in depth—we will see administrative and
                            economic chaos. They don’t have the numbers needed to maintain it.</p>
                        <p>The President: What will happen to Cabinda?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: Cabinda is now
                            characterized by a separatist tendency, aided by native Cabindans,
                            supported by Zaire and Congo-Brazzaville. So it will probably be
                            separated, with grave consequences to Angola because of its economic
                            value.</p>
                        <p>The President: We are very sympathetic with what you are doing, and I
                            hope you will convey our support for what your group is doing and we
                            will do our best to help. What you are doing is in the best interest of
                            the West, and free societies around the world.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Antunes</persName>: Thank you for your
                            expression of support. Our struggle is truly a difficult one. We will go
                            the whole route to achieve a free society. We are facing a real struggle
                            against obstructionist groups and we need all your help.</p>
                        <p>The President: This meeting with you is much more encouraging than the
                            one I had in Brussels with Goncalves. It appeared then that the <pb

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Based on current available intelligence information, it is estimated
                            that there are between 1,200 and 1,900 Cuban military personnel in
                            Angola. The majority of these Cubans have been introduced in late
                            September and early October 1975—greatly augmenting Cuban long-standing
                            involvement. The public rationale for this significantly increased
                            intervention was provided by the Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations
                            in a speech at the U.N. on 8 October 1975—quoted in part in paragraph 6
                            below.</p>
                        <p>2. Cuban assistance to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> has
                            stretched over the past ten years. Begun in part as support for an
                            “anti-colonial struggle,” it has been intensified since the Portuguese
                            announced their intention to leave Angola. Over this period, several
                            hundred <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> cadre are estimated to
                            have been trained by the Cubans, mainly in the rear <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> bases in the Congo, but more
                            recently in <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> bases in Angola
                            itself. Cuban technical advisors, probably numbering several dozen, have
                            been assisting the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> both in the
                            Congo and more recently in Angola. Some Cubans are reportedly working
                            with Soviet advisors at the Massangano <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> training base in Angola.</p>
                        <p>3. Two Cuban ships were reported to have called at Porto Amboim (south of
                            Luanda) during the first week in October 1975: The “Isla Coral” and the
                            “Viet Nam Heroica.” One is a combined passenger/<pb n="327" facs="0366"
                                xml:id="pg_327"/>freighter, equipped to carry 240 passengers, and
                            the other is a freighter. It is reliably reported that as many as 700
                            Cubans arrived on these ships, claiming to be volunteers for service
                            with the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. We have confirmed that
                            these ships were in African waters at the time.</p>
                        <p>4. At about the same time, Cuban troops and equipment were reported
                            arriving in Pointe Noire, Congo. According to these reports, three Cuban
                            ships arrived there between 25 September and mid-October 1975 and
                            offloaded equipment which included tanks, armored vehicles, military
                            trucks and several cases of unidentified matériel. Most of the equipment
                            delivered by these ships is already enroute to Angola, being transported
                            in <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>-owned ships. In addition, the
                            Cuban ships were reported to have carried at least 900 Cuban troops,
                            about half of whom subsequently departed for Angola proper while the
                            remainder were sent to the Cabinda border area.</p>
                        <p>5. The Cubans have provided professional leadership to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> in fighting against <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> at Norton De Matos, in South
                            Central Angola, where at least one Cuban military advisor was reportedly
                            killed in early October 1975.</p>
                        <p>6. Ricardo Alarcon DeQuesada, Cuban Ambassador to the U.N., recently
                            provided the basis and explanation for a much more active intervention,
                            not only on the part of Cuba, but also of other Communist nations. He
                            said on 8 October 1975 in his speech to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"
                                >UNGA</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>a. “In Angola the conspiracy of imperialism, its allies and lackeys, has
                            found concrete expression in the brazen interference designed to

                            integrity; snatching away from the people’s liberation movement of

                            colonialism, while condemning the future state to control by
                            transnational corporations. Cuba renews the expression of its full
                            solidarity with the people’s liberation movement in Angola—yesterday
                            heroic in its struggle against the European colonizer; today firm in its
                            defence of true independence.</p>
                        <p>b. “In the face of the scandalous interference of imperialists,
                            colonialists and racists (in Angola), it is an elementary duty (for
                            Cuba) to offer its (the Angolan) people the effective assistance that
                            may be required for that country to ensure its true independence and
                            full sovereignty. In order to spur the decolonization process, a
                            coherent strategy must be implemented with the participation of all
                            progressive forces. This strategy is essential in order to face up to
                            colonialist and racist machinations against the peoples of Namibia and
                            Zimbabwe and must oppose <pb n="328" facs="0367" xml:id="pg_328"

                        <p>1. I appreciate timeliness of Dept decision to reduce staff and we are
                            proceeding to implement instructions contained <gloss

                            final effort to persuade Dept to close post temporarily at this point
                            rather than allow it to remain open with reduced staff for several
                            additional days. The question to be asked and answered, it seems to me,
                            is what do we stand to gain and what price do we have to pay for keeping
                            reduced staff here until Nov 10. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not

                            important but I frankly think that ability of remaining Consular

                            even stronger, and we can expect that to happen between now and Nov 11,
                            and since Portuguese authority here is almost non-existent now, I think
                            we have to accept possibility that <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> hotheads might well find it necessary or convenient to
                            arrest or detain one or more members of Consulate staff. Even if this
                            were not a real possibility, I would still recommend closing of post now
                            on grounds that prospective military situation between now and Nov 11
                            will expose remaining <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> personnel to
                            unacceptable levels of personal danger and their ability to leave at the
                            last minute will be severely curtailed by the lack of commercial
                            transportation. I have not yet been able to locate the High Commissioner
                            today, but I suspect the vessel in which he will leave is going to be
                            fully loaded. He just may have to refuse to take our six remaining
                            employees.</p>
                        <p>3. In the event the Department decides to keep the post open for
                            additional period, both Rodgers and Doubleday have volunteered to stay.
                            In light of Rodgers’s greater experience, seniority and contacts, I have
                            asked him to remain. CRO Casey will also stay.</p>

                        <p>5. After we close, we will keep as many locals on the payroll as are
                            willing to remain in Luanda. A number of them have long years of service
                            and we cannot in good conscience lay them off. Too, they will be needed
                            for maintenance work and other services and we will want qualified
                            people to be on board when we come back in.</p>
                        <p>6. I understand that <gloss target="#t_ONA_1">ONA</gloss> aircraft making

                            following delivery of passengers to Lisbon and brief stop in Rome. If
                            this schedule holds, I and staff and <gloss target="#t_TDY_1"
                                >TDY</gloss> personnel (except those assigned elsewhere in Africa)
                            will remain on plane and ask to be dropped off at Dulles Airport rather
                            than holding over in Lisbon. I would appreciate if the Department could
                            ensure <gloss target="#t_ONA_1">ONA</gloss> is directed to carry us as

                            before Angola independence and that it would be more economic in terms
                            of dollars and manpower to move other staff members to Dept in this way
                            rather than holding over in Lisbon for later commercial flight.</p>

                        <p>265503. Subject: Angolan Recognition.</p>
                        <p>1. Portugal will grant independence to Angola on Nov. 11 and, it appears,
                            without transferring power to any one of the three major liberation
                            movements. In this event it seems certain that Soviet-backed Popular
                            Movement for Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>), based in Luanda, the capital, will proclaim itself
                            sole govt of Angola. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> intends to
                            recognize <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> regime immediately.
                            Most Communist powers and some “progressive” countries in Africa and
                            elsewhere are likely to follow suit fairly quickly.</p>
                        <p>2. It is probable the two rival movements, National Front for Liberation
                            of Angola (<gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>) and National Union
                            for Total Independence of Angola (<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss>) will also proclaim jointly their own regime.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> likely to base its claim to
                            legitimacy on purported control of capital, of 12 of the 16 district
                            capitals, and of two-thirds of Angolan territory and population. It will
                            presumably also repeat its current charges that other two movements are
                            “tools of the imperialists” (meaning Zaire, South Africa, US and France)
                            which have lost any right to represent Angolan people.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> control is actually limited to
                            six district capitals and only one entire district. It controls about
                            one-third of Angola’s territory and people. It also controls Luanda and
                            the administrative structure remaining there after <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> ejected <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> elements
                            from Luanda last July ending transitional coalition govt composed of all
                            three movements. On the other hand, <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> together
                            control majority of territory and population and, since July reverses,
                            have continued to make military comeback. <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> forces
                            have recently advanced close to Luanda in north and have recaptured key
                            centers of Lobito and Benguela in south.</p>
                        <p>5. (<hi rend="italic">FYI</hi>) On Nov. 3 we temporarily closed our
                            Consulate General in Luanda and withdrew its staff to Lisbon. A Dept
                            spokesman stated that the decision to close the Consulate was made for
                            security and political reasons (<hi rend="italic">End FYI</hi>).</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, which recognizes all three
                            movements, is currently engaged in last ditch effort to restore peace
                            and to insure orderly transfer <pb n="332" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_332"
                            />of sovereignty by Portugal. It is our hope that this effort will
                            succeed, or at least provide opportunity for further negotiations among
                            Angolans. Present indications are that <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> will probably not be deterred from unilaterally
                            declaring independence and seeking widest possible international
                            recognition as sole govt of Angola. <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> have
                            reportedly told <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> representatives in
                            Kampala that they are prepared to join a government composed of all
                            three movements, but will establish a rival government of their own if
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> does declare itself Angola’s
                            sole government.</p>
                        <p>7. US position is to favor true independence for the state of Angola and
                            its rule by a government that, through a peaceful, negotiated solution,
                            attracts the support of the great bulk of the population of Angola. We
                            would view a claim by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> that it
                            is the government of Angola, and that it merits recognition as such, as
                            unfounded, because in fact it controls a minority of the population and
                            territory of Angola and consequently is not in a position to represent
                            the interests of the state of Angola internationally. Recognition by the
                            international community of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            regime as the Angolan government could only serve as further obstacle to
                            search for a peaceful, negotiated solution and to validation of
                            principle of self-determination. The claim of <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> would, in our
                            view, deserve to be taken into account by the international community in
                            weighing possibilities and timing of recognition of the state of Angola
                            and of the government which actually exercises effective control of that
                            state.</p>
                        <p>8. Action requested: Unless you have objection or believe it would be
                            counterproductive, action addressees should immediately seek to discuss
                            current developments in Angola with host governments, drawing on
                            information and guidance above. Purpose of discussion is 1) to seek host
                            governments’ assessment of situation; 2) to insure they are aware of
                            actual situation with respect to territorial/population control; and 3)
                            to express our hope that they, too, would refrain from making any hasty
                            move toward recognizing <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> as
                            government of Angola at time of independence.</p>
                        <p>9. Report results soonest. If during course of discussion it becomes
                            apparent that host governments have in fact decided to recognize <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, you should include in your response

                            the United States has the fullest sympathy for people of Angola in the
                            tragic circumstances attending their achievement of independence. We

                            bringing an early end to the fighting and in promoting negotiations
                            among all Angolan parties. We remain ready to assist the Angolan people
                            in the vital task of building their nation. End quote.</p>
                        <p>6. On November 10 the Secretary responded to two questions on Angola and
                            Soviet involvement as follows:<note n="5" xml:id="d136fn5">For the text

                        <p>Begin quote: Question: Mr. Secretary, will you discuss with us in some
                            detail the nature and volume of the involvement of the Soviet Union and
                            Cuba in Angola, which unexpectedly got its independence a day early? You
                            mentioned this at a hearing the other day, and I would like to know if
                            it is in manpower, dollars, etc.—what you can tell us about it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I
                            don’t have the figures here, and I cannot go much beyond what I stated
                            the other day, which is that the Soviet Union earlier this year
                            introduced a substantial amount of military equipment into
                            Angola—substantial in relation to the balance of forces that then
                            existed, that Cuba has also participated in the form of advisors and of
                            military equipment. We consider both of these steps by extra-continental
                            powers a serious matter and really, as far as the Soviet Union is
                            concerned, not compatible with the spirit of relaxation of tensions.</p>
                        <p>Question: Sir, we are also an extra-territorial power. What are [we]
                            doing there?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our interest
                            in Angola, which is related to the fact that the access to the sea of
                            the surrounding countries goes through Angola, was basically generated
                            by the intervention of other countries. The United States has no other
                            interest except the territorial integrity and independence of Angola. We
                            strongly support the call of the Organization of African Unity for a
                            cease-fire and for negotiation among the three factions that are
                            involved there to form a coalition government, and we have no United
                            States interest to pursue in Angola. End quote.</p>

                            asking for. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> wanted 15
                            aircraft by the end of the month. We’ve been fighting in small units and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: And will they be used

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: An alternative would
                            be to send a team in and take them out on the ground. That would be
                            effective and less expensive.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FHM_1">Fish</persName>: Yes, and they are only 15
                            miles from Kinshasa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: Well, the problem is that
                            we have to deal with the local people. We can’t get them to go in and do
                            anything. They talk about it, and they say they are willing but nothing
                            has been done. So when we talk about a team, we would need something
                            better than we have. The working group’s first consideration was to try
                            to get the MIGs before they became operational.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: We’ve got to decide now how to take some diplomatic action
                            on Angola. The tide is turning. This hero at <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: At the Forty Committee
                            meeting he said he was running out of money and we had to get the

                        <p>The Secretary: It really is a sign of the amateurs at work. Diplomacy is
                            no alternative to what he’s doing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Brent and I told him
                            to crank up another program to show what it would take to win.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: That g.d. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> does not

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: I agree. I think at the

                        <p>The Secretary: I think <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> will
                            leak that he’s urged a diplomatic effort so we’d better do

                            I wonder what the possibility of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            involvement is. Get some, you know, <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> appointee out there. I think <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> should stress in his note that
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> is already in it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How can anyone be in government 15 years and say we’ll
                            lose a war in two weeks and therefore you should settle it
                            diplomatically.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: He didn’t give a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: He feels the Soviet
                            escalation has been to the MIG level, which will turn the tide. The
                            Strellas from Israel is enough of an answer he thinks. He feels it will
                            gain us a month.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: He thinks we haven’t
                            seen the effect of the Cubans being there yet either.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That I think is correct. Either we will lose, and you know
                            those guys are pros; they’re not amateurs. They will have a ceasefire if
                            the military balance comes towards them and then they’ll break the
                            ceasefire as soon as they can and take over the rest. The other route is
                            to match them if we can. Everything else is doubletalk.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Did you get any reaction
                            from the Soviets?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: They say they’re doing it against the Chinese.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: Well, they saw the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: Pretty well.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Buffum</persName>: Is the Strella a match for
                            the MIGs?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: No, for Christ’s sake.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: They think knocking
                            down one or two planes will stop them, and they say the MIG’s are not
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: They don’t have to be effective! They just have to drop a
                            bomb or two within a kilometer of the troops and they’ll scatter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BW_1">Buffum</persName>: Can’t the Zairians put in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: I think we should get them
                            some French mercenaries or any other kind.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: The French just gave $1½

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: I’m sorry I was
                            delayed. It was Congressman Pike again. As you probably know, he’s after
                            the 10 years of our 40 Committee records. These records vary—some are
                            minutes of what went on at a meeting, while others simply record a
                            decision. We’ll have to trim down what was decided without getting into
                            details of how we arrived at that decision.</p>
                        <p>Well, Bill.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Yes, pretty hard. The

                        <p>Now, our paper offers three options—One, mainly diplomatic; two,
                            supporting the South Africans; and three, substantial increments of

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Joe (Sisco)</persName> may want to brief on
                            diplomatic initiatives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: These are not mutually
                            exclusive.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: I agree. We do not see the
                            diplomatic alternative as a viable one. We were seeking stabilization of
                            the military situation; we did not expect our covert action efforts to
                            result in a military victory. There’s no doubt that we need to step up
                            our efforts. We’ve taken two steps. One is a note we’ve drafted to go to
                            the Soviets.<note n="4" xml:id="d139fn4"><ref target="#d140">Document
                                    140</ref>.</note> The main thrust is that it is costly to both
                            sides, and it would be in everybody’s interest to reach a settlement.
                            The second item is that we’ve sent a message to see if the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> could get involved.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d139fn5">See <ref target="#d138fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    138</ref>.</note> But obviously this effort will be of no
                            pressure on the Soviets unless the military activities are
                            stabilized.</p>

                            are fresh out of money. We are just about to the edge of nothing, or

                            would be if <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> would direct Defense to

                            purpose. That is a possibility. In fact, the only one I see. It would
                            require not only the normal finding, but the consent of the
                            appropriations committees.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Well, it would take a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Do you have to go

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We would have to hook on

                            trying to avoid—revealing the intelligence budget. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: That’s possible. We may

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Look at all the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Right. The three options
                            (referring to charts) are about the same. The main difference is in air.
                            These are big operations. The scope and size are such as to make one
                            question whether we should attempt it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Can they use such

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Option B, encouraging
                            South Africa. What does that include specifically?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: They’d like to get their
                            troops out, and hire mercenaries. They say that they don’t have the
                            money to do this and have turned to us. I think that this is political
                            dynamite. The press would be after us. They and Africans would say that
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> is supported by the big,
                            brave Russians, while the others are backed by the bad South Africans
                            and Americans. That would be unpleasant.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: More than that. Your
                            description is too mild. What is in the interests of the South Africans?
                            They have more interest in being there than we do and they don’t need
                            our help. I do not favor giving any support to the South Africans. I do

                            want our lawyers to look into the legal question, but even if it is not

                            about this. We would not want to discourage them, but leave them to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: What would these three

                            not going to let go. What would be the practical impact of these
                            options, and over what period of time?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I’ve said before that I do

                            I thought maybe by the middle of December, but maybe now not until
                            January. But once it does, the direction of the fight will go all the
                            other way. The [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            will slow but not stop it; the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: These are not mercenaries;
                            they are regular Cuban troops. And the experienced Cubans and best

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: What is the capacity of

                            I’ve visited there and these people want to fight. They are natural
                            fighters; they even eat each other. Leadership is the main factor.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Is it possible to give
                            priority to some leadership component? Second, with the hardware, what
                            do they get to combat Soviet air support?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: We definitely have not
                            done the training that was needed, because we had to concentrate on a

                            wouldn’t send any of his men out for training—he claimed that he needed

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: And the relationship
                            between some of the outsiders and the locals is not good. They are

                            simply because they did not have the money. This [<hi rend="italic"

                            Although we’d have to fly that out of Ascension, which means we need the

                            used to it, it is not too bad.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I want to point out that
                            the <gloss target="#t_TOW_1">TOW</gloss>s are a sophisticated weapon, a

                            trouble with them. They are hard to handle, even with good troops. So
                            don’t think you can put those in there and expect effective use. The LOW

                        <p>We have viewed with astonishment the precipitate action of the U.S.S.R.
                            in extending on November 11 immediate diplomatic recognition to only one
                            of the three political factions and to one purporting to be the legal
                            government of the Republic of Angola, when in fact that group
                            represented a minority of the population and controlled less than
                            one-third of Angolan territory on that date. Moreover, the Soviet Union
                            must be conscious of the fact that it has extended its recognition in
                            the face of an appeal from the Organization of African Unity for all
                            countries to refrain from extending diplomatic recognition to any of the
                            three liberation movements while the Organization undertakes efforts to
                            obtain a negotiated solution to the Angolan problem.</p>
                        <p>Together with the rest of the world the United States is fully aware of
                            the large quantity of sophisticated arms, military equipment and
                            personnel which the Soviet Union has caused to be sent by air and by sea
                            to enable the aforementioned minority faction to perpetuate a tragic and
                            bloody civil war in a country that has already suffered much. In our
                            opinion the conduct of the Soviet Union in this matter has now surpassed
                            all bounds of restraint, and has additionally placed it in serious
                            conflict with the great majority of the members of the Organization of
                            African Unity. It is not in the spirit of our mutual efforts to reduce
                            tensions in the world; it is not consistent with the Declaration of
                            Principles we both signed and if continued can set back the progress of
                                détente.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">At the summit in May 1972,

                        <p>We urge the Soviet Union to give serious consideration to a
                            re-examination of its present policy in Angola. We propose that the
                            Soviet Union discontinue the efforts it is now making to escalate the
                            fighting in Angola, to give public support to the efforts of the O.A.U.
                            to promote a cease-fire and the subsequent initiation of peaceful
                            negotiations among the three Angolan movements and to issue an appeal to
                            all nations to cease their intervention in Angola’s internal
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>The United States for its part pursues no unilateral interests in Angola
                            and is exclusively concerned with seeing the people of that country live
                            in peace, independence and well-being. We oppose any ac<pb n="355"
                                facs="0394" xml:id="pg_355"/>tion that would make Angola an arena
                            for competition between external powers. Our policies and actions are
                            designed to assure achievement of these objectives and we are prepared
                            to cooperate in any effort that insulates Angola from major power
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>We are willing to play any helpful diplomatic role that promises to lead
                            to a cease-fire and to peaceful negotiations toward a solution in Angola
                            which will be acceptable to the three political movements.</p>

                                expressed apprehension over growing Soviet aid to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and inquired whether the United
                                States would continue to support the other liberation movements, or
                                promote a cease-fire and establishment of a coalition government.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I am replying at some length because I regard this
                            problem as one of great importance, which has ramifications that go well
                            beyond southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>Moscow has given the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> financial and
                            military aid since 1956. In 1972, Moscow’s interest in the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> appeared to wane because of
                            factional disputes within the movement, but after the coup in Portugal
                            in 1974, the Soviets renewed their support. Deliveries of military aid
                            were stepped up in the fall of 1974 and had become particularly evident
                            by March 1975.</p>
                        <p>There are many reasons why the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> has
                            committed itself in Angola:</p>
                        <p>—A pro-Soviet regime in Angola would enable the Soviets to exert a major
                            influence on the liberation drive in southern Africa, which they have
                            publicly pledged to support.</p>
                        <p>—Soviet support for the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            contributes to Soviet credibility and influence with other clients in
                            the region, such as Congo-<pb n="356" facs="0395" xml:id="pg_356"
                            />Brazzaville, Guinea and Mozambique, with the Portuguese Communist
                            Party and with other liberation movements in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>—The Soviets regard the Chinese as their major competitors for influence
                            with militant regimes in Africa in general and with liberation movements
                            in southern Africa in particular; they do not want to be bested in this
                            competition.</p>
                        <p>—Strategically, Angola would be of significance to the Soviets if they
                            contemplate an expansion in their naval activities in the South Atlantic
                            on a scale that would require a naval base in the region. For the time
                            being, however, we believe that their primary goals are political rather
                            than strategic.</p>
                        <p>Since March 1975, when the Soviet supply effort assumed large
                            proportions, we estimate that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            has delivered over 10,000 tons of arms and equipment to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. We believe that this effort is
                            continuing, and that the rate of deliveries has increased in the past
                            few weeks, especially since the beginning of November. We understand
                            that deliveries have included armored vehicles, heavy artillery, air
                            defense weapons, anti-tank missiles, mobile rocket launchers, infantry
                            weapons, and possibly MIG aircraft.</p>
                        <p>There are indications also of the presence in Angola of some Soviet
                            advisers and technicans performing support functions as well as advising
                            on military strategy. We know that Soviet technicians are in Brazzaville
                            to instruct <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> personnel in the use
                            of new weapons. If the sophistication of the weapons provided by the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> increases, more Soviet
                            technicians will be required in Angola. Up to now, however, the Soviets
                            have allowed the Cubans to act as their surrogate in many support
                            roles.</p>
                        <p>The estimate of Cubans now in Angola is 2,500–3,000. This includes
                            advisers, technicians, and direct combatants in Cabinda and thoughout
                            Angola, and possibly pilots.</p>
                        <p>The inflow of Soviet aid is critical to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>’s fortunes. Earlier this year, Soviet weapons and
                            equipment permitted the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to expand
                            greatly the territory under its control and to threaten the very
                            existence of <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>. The new and heavier influx of
                            arms, together with Cuban and possibly Soviet personnel and technical
                            advisers, suggests that the military balance may once again turn in
                            favor of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that Soviet assistance is intended to permit the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to negotiate with the other
                            movements but is rather intended to give the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> the means necessary to achieve a victory. Having
                            accorded immediate recognition to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> regime and endorsed the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>’s claim to be the sole legitimate representative of
                            the Angolan people, the Soviets have publicly staked their prestige on
                            the outcome <pb n="357" facs="0396" xml:id="pg_357"/>in Angola. Despite
                            the damage to its relations with other African governments as a result
                            of its commitment to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, Moscow
                            seems to believe that there is more to be lost by backing down than by
                            pressing on with its present policy.</p>
                        <p>Should it prove impossible for the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                            >MPLA</gloss>, even with substantially increased Soviet assistance, to
                            gain a decisive military advantage, Moscow would be obliged to
                            reconsider its present course. We do not believe the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> is prepared to commit its own combat
                            forces to Angola, although it may introduce pilots and send more
                            technicians and advisers. Even if the Soviets opt for a political
                            solution in Angola in the future, they will want to assure that the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> negotiates from a position of
                            stength and emerges as the dominant force in any agreed upon coalition
                            government.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the effect on Soviet-American relations we have already
                            made it clear to the Soviets that we view this blatant intervention of
                            theirs with deep concern and we intend to pursue this theme more
                            publicly in the coming weeks. Frankly, Mr. President, we are inclined to
                            believe that there is a substantial anti-Chinese character to the Soviet
                            move. They hope to demonstrate to militant Third World leaders that only
                            with Soviet aid can they pursue their revolutionary ambitions.</p>
                        <p>With regard to our aid, we feel the problem now is less one of matériel
                            than an aggressive offensive effort which depends on inspiring
                            confidence in local forces and providing them with adequate leadership
                            and training. Nevertheless, our commitment is a continuing one though,
                            for obvious reasons, we will not make it public.</p>
                        <p>As far as negotiating a ceasefire is concerned, we should be prepared to
                            accept a ceasefire in place, but this would have to be conditioned on an
                            end to Soviet military aid. Moreover, we would not object to the idea of
                            a tripartite coalition, and, in general, our strategy is to support
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and other African efforts to
                            promote a ceasefire and settlement. As you know, our original aim in
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> was to prevent a massive <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> victory before independence. That
                            has been achieved and we now believe the political dimension should be
                            given more emphasis, especially in terms of working with key African
                            countries in support of a reasonable settlement. In this regard, we hope
                            to work closely with you and we hope that your government can play a key
                            role in developing African support. As an immediate concrete step toward
                            the achievement of a peaceful settlement, Mr. President, I urge your
                            government to use its influence to persuade other governments,
                            especially in Africa, to restrict overflight and landing rights for
                            Soviet aircraft en route to Angola with cargoes of arms and other
                            military equipment.</p>
                        <p>The United States seeks neither to dominate an independent Angola nor to
                            confront the Soviet Union there, but we cannot remain aloof <pb n="358"
                                facs="0397" xml:id="pg_358"/>in the face of a clear Soviet power
                            play. I hope, Mr. President, that you will convey this assurance to
                            African heads of state.</p>
                        <p>I am grateful for this opportunity to exchange views on the Angolan
                            situation with you, Mr. President, and I hope that we can work closely
                            together on this problem in the future. Perhaps we should initiate
                            further contacts among our senior officers responsible for these
                            matters. I would welcome your own views on this serious and complex
                            issue, and propose that we stay in contact on this matter. If you would
                            find it useful, I would be glad to send someone over to discuss the
                            subject in greater detail.</p>

                            Angola could not be viewed other than as an attempt to divert attention
                            from the real causes underlining the events which are taking place in
                            that country.</p>
                        <p>As has already been stated earlier to the US Government the information
                            disseminated in the USA alleging mass shipments of arms by the Soviet
                            Union to Angola and the presence there of “hundreds” of Soviet military
                            personnel is without foundation. Not a single Soviet man is taking part
                            in the hostilities in Angola. Likewise the Soviet side rejects
                            assertions that it is the support by the Soviet Union of the legitimate
                            Government of the People’s Republic of Angola, which is recognized
                            already by many states in the world, [that] is the cause of what is
                            going on in Angola.</p>
                        <p>The real causes of that are an open secret. It is well known that the
                            foreign monopolies which for scores of years were masters in the land
                                <pb n="359" facs="0398" xml:id="pg_359"/>of Angola were in no way
                            happy by the beginning of the process of decolonization in this country
                            which was bound inevitably to lead and had led to the victory of the
                            national patriotic forces. That was why even prior to the granting of
                            independence certain foreign circles banked on splitting the national
                            liberation movement in the country and encouraged and supported
                            militarily those separatist movements which bound themselves with
                            foreign interests.</p>
                        <p>Now the events have reached the point when a direct intervention of
                            neocolonialist forces has begun in Angola, in the first place, on the
                            part of the Republic of South Africa. Regular units of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SAR_1">SAR</gloss>, detachments of South African and
                            Rhodesian mercenaries are participating in the military actions. It is
                            also known that these groupings receive an extensive aid, including
                            military aid, from the United States. In other words, the original cause
                            of the continuing bloodshed in Angola lies in the interference into the
                            internal affairs of that country by the forces, which do not wish to
                            reconcile themselves to the loss of their position there. And the US
                            Government knows all this.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, being a consistent supporter of
                            the liquidation of remnants of colonialism, it recognized the People’s
                            Republic of Angola and its Government, formed by the Popular Movement
                            for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>),
                            which enjoys a wide support of the Angolan people as a leading national
                            patriotic organization. It is not by chance that by the present moment
                            the People’s Republic of Angola has been already recognized by nearly 30
                            states of the world, half of which are the African countries—members of
                            the Organization of African Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                            >OAU</gloss>). It shows in itself the groundlessness of statements that
                            the Soviet position on this question supposedly contradicts the position
                            of the African states.</p>
                        <p>It is also known that after concluding in January 1975 an agreement among
                            the three Angolan movements on the order of granting independence to
                            Angola and on establishing a transitional Government with the
                            participation in it of representatives of those movements the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> welcomed the creation of such a
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Yet, shortly after, the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> embarked on the path of
                            undermining the transitional Government thus frustrating its normal
                            functioning and eventually starting military actions which were
                            encouraged and supported from outside.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union never was and could not be in favour of unleashing a
                            civil war in Angola. It has always supported and is acting in support of
                            the aspirations of the Angolan patriotic forces, as well as of the
                            efforts of the African states designed to ensure national independence
                            and peaceful development of Angola. The Soviet Union would only welcome
                            such mode of action which would be pursuing the goal <pb n="360"
                                facs="0399" xml:id="pg_360"/>of consolidating in Angola all the
                            forces that are striving for a genuine independence and free development
                            of this country.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union firmly adheres to the position that armed aggression in
                            Angola be seized and the right of its people be safeguarded to decide by
                            itself how to build the new life under conditions of independence and
                            territorial integrity without any outside interference.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union is prepared to state publicly about it. If the USA is
                            also prepared to make a similar statement and act accordingly, we would
                            welcome this.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the above-stated, attempts to lay some sort of blame on
                            the Soviet Union for the present developments in Angola are devoid of
                            any foundation. Equally groundless are the endeavors to present this
                            matter in such a way as if the policy of the Soviet Union toward Angola
                            is not consistent with the Soviet-American documents.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: Yes, and if they bring
                            in the MIGs they can do it. He hasn’t made much progress in the
                            north.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How does he impress you?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: He’s serious and sober.
                            I think he’s intelligent and devoted to his cause. But he has no depth
                            of leadership. His No. 2 is impressive and tough, however.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Does he think he has any hope?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: Well, the boat only made
                            10 knots and it could not be moved without having our people on board
                            and since it could be caught by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>, the American guys would have been captured. So we
                            thought it was best not to send it. But small things like that are
                            getting to him.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: There is no substitute for winning. All the characters
                            here are busy second guessing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: That one was killed by

                            not considered safe.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: Why?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: I don’t remember the
                            reason <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> called that one off. I think
                            they told him the time was not right. It never got to the working
                            group.</p>
                        <p>There were several other things that came up that I need your views on.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BO_1">Bongo</persName> wants to have us try to
                            ship things through Gabon to Angola.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: It’s a good idea to involve more Africans. Don’t you
                            think?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: What about weapons for
                                <persName corresp="#p_BO_1">Bongo</persName> himself?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Can’t we sell them? We can put it in our program.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: It takes a presidential
                            determination to sell them any and there’s only $43 million for all of
                            Africa to give or to sell on credit. He’d have to knock someone else
                            off. Mali has already been taken off in principle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: We should be
                            responsive.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I think it’s a good idea to ship something through it. We
                            can go to Congress on that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: As long as we don’t
                            have any illusions with how it will help with the other Africans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: No, but it will help with Congress. Has <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: He wants us to level
                            with the Nigerians on what the South Africans are doing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Are they in with organized forces now?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Yes, that’s the real
                            problem with the Africans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: As many as the Cubans?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: No, perhaps 400 but they
                            are very effective. If they pull out of the South, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> will wrap it up. The <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> has 30,000 under arms now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: How does that compare with
                            the other side?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: Well, we think <persName

                            and with others, maybe a total of 7,000.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: If we get [<hi

                            will help solve the ration problem on which they need advice. Maybe we

                        <p>The Secretary: Can it be pulled together?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: <persName

                        <p>The Secretary: What does pull together mean?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> says the South Africans are
                            helping <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> because the US is
                            helping <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName> and he says the
                            stuff the South Africans claim they’re sending him is not getting to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Is it true?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: We think he’s getting it
                            but it’s not possible to tell. [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                            should help for about 3 months.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Someone should look to see whether we have a scheme which
                            makes any sense. <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName> is trying
                            to do the minimum to cover his ass. He’ll be in worse shape if he

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: The problem is how
                            heavily we should try to get more people involved.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: What else can we do?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: Well, there are US naval
                            forces in the area which <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            mentioned.</p>

                        <p>[The President:] There is another problem—Angola. We don’t think the
                            turmoil there is good. I know in general what you are doing and some of
                            the others. It is not a healthy situation to have that sort of
                            tearing-up situation going on. If we could find some sort of settlement
                            where no one would lose face . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: We have no troops
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The President: But you have our neighbors to the south there—Cuba.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you could get the
                            Cuban troops withdrawn . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: Why don’t you talk to
                            the Cubans?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have almost no
                            contact. But if you could withdraw them we would get other outside
                            forces withdrawn. If you stop the airlift we will do likewise, and we
                            could turn to a coalition.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: Already almost 50% of
                            the nations have recognized one side. They have always refused a
                            coalition.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you keep putting
                            equipment in and we do, then we create a strain on our relations because
                            then someone must win and someone lose. Then perhaps the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> could help.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: It is difficult to check
                            equipment. We have to do it directly, but through Zaire it can be done
                            indirectly—not that we accuse you of that. I think a political solution
                            should come first. We are not interested in Angola. It was the process
                            of decolonization. But you know how Africa goes. One day it goes this
                            way; another day that way.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can’t defend to our
                            people your massive airlift and the Cuban troops. It can’t go on without
                            raising serious questions here. We will have to find ways either to
                            insulate it or match it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DA_1">Dobrynin</persName>: It is not up to me to
                            argue. Angola is a long way away. I will convey to my government. If you
                            had some proposal other than “you just shouldn’t do this.”</p>
                        <p>The President: I am for détente, but this is difficult for me to
                            explain.</p>

                        <p>K: Secondly, on Angola. We cannot think of any other solution except to
                            ask outside countries to promise not to send more arms in. If you are
                            worried about the border in Zaire, we are willing to consider a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> force there. We promise you we would
                            exercise restraint on our part and to get all foreign forces out.</p>
                        <p>D: You are asking us to put this on the same level politically. I see no
                            problem with this kind of thing. I already reported what the President
                            mentioned yesterday.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">See <ref target="#d145"
                                    >Document 145</ref>.</note> What you are saying, I am going to
                            add. The question really is in this case not very easy to control. It is
                            in the capital of the country and no one knows where they are.</p>
                        <p>K: But look it will be easily known if something comes in or not. If we
                            don’t keep our word, that will affect our relationship.</p>
                        <p>D: Do you have any ideas if Africa could do something? It is their
                            business. It is not natural for us really.</p>
                        <p>K: No, but the way we could do it is to have the Organization of African
                            Unity ask all outside powers, you see, and then we would both have an
                            excuse to do it.</p>
                        <p>D: Ask whom?</p>
                        <p>K: Ask all outside powers to stop supplying arms.</p>
                        <p>D: OK, I will pass this on. A public statement from both sides? Who is
                            going to control it?</p>
                        <p>K: We would be prepared to have the Organization of African Unity control
                            it.</p>
                        <p>D: Who is going to control South Africa?</p>
                        <p>K: We have nothing to do directly with South Africa, but we would bring
                            major pressure on them.</p>
                        <p>D: But if they continue?</p>
                        <p>K: Look, we are trying to win. We are trying to get everybody out of
                            it.</p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="0407" xml:id="pg_368"/>
                        <p>D: I really don’t haveto do this for the time being. I would like some
                            political solution but to stop something very difficult to control.</p>
                        <p>K: The political solution—why not let the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> talk to the other units.</p>
                        <p>D: You mean they should appeal or we should appeal to them to sit down
                            and talk.</p>
                        <p>K: We should all appeal to them to sit down and talk.</p>
                        <p>D: You have more information. I have very little information.</p>
                        <p>K: We would be prepared to urge them all to sit down and talk.</p>
                        <p>D: Appeal to them to sit down and talk from the two of us or a member of
                            the Security Council. What do you think is better?</p>
                        <p>K: It could be an appeal from the Organization of African Unity which the
                            two of us support.</p>
                        <p>D: In this way and as a second part of the deal, maybe not as a first
                            one, politically I am sure he would understand.</p>
                        <p>K: But there has to be an end of supplies. This has to be part of it. I
                            think it would make a good impression here.</p>
                        <p>D: The question is themselves. Whether they are going to take this from
                            us.</p>
                        <p>K: I think if the two of us agree, we can get them to agree.</p>
                        <p>D: I will send this to Moscow and see what their reaction is.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Let’s look at the
                                <gloss target="#t_U2_1">U–2</gloss> coverage of Angola. Are we
                            talking about one flight?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: This started with the
                            MIGs—we wanted to see if they were there. We would also get some good
                            battle information.</p>
                        <p>Smith: We could not determine about the MIGs at the time.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I have some reservations
                            now. We have gotten some photography, although the <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWY_1">Smith</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: If we are talking
                            about one flight, we could stage it from Florida. We did that in the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">Clements</persName>: Yes, that looked good
                            in the White House, but it was not very well received in the Pentagon.
                            It cost a bundle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I’m concerned about the
                            reactions on the Hill. They would throw fits.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: I’m telling you how they
                            would react; I’m not saying whether it is right. I think the real
                            question is, is it worth it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: Yes, is it worth the

                            because the weather is always bad.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: What could the <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: It can go with the

                            about it now—if there are no MIGs. Can’t we get someone to go take a

                            Zaire and Zambia, and southern Africa.</p>

                        <p>—The impact on United States interests in Africa and elsewhere of
                            continuing Soviet and Cuban intervention in Angola.</p>
                        <p>—The impact on United States-Soviet relations of continued Soviet and
                            Cuban intervention in Angola.</p>

                        <p>—Whether United States interests warrant support of South African
                            government efforts to influence the outcome in Angola. Evaluate
                            probability and consequence of United States direct or indirect policy
                            change toward South Africa.</p>
                        <p>Based upon the foregoing assessments, the study should evaluate
                            alternative United States policies toward Angola and present options for
                            achieving United States objectives to include pros and cons for each.
                            The options should take into account the time available for action.</p>
                        <p>The study should be prepared by an ad hoc group composed of
                            representatives of the addressees and the National Security Council
                            staff and chaired by the representative of the Secretary of State.
                            Knowledge of the study and participation in its preparation should be
                            kept on a strict need-to-know basis. Any additional participation should
                            be specifically approved by the Chairman of the Group. Differing agency
                            judgments should be clearly set forth.</p>
                        <p>The study should be submitted to the Assistant to the President for
                            National Security Affairs no later than January 2, 1976.<note n="2"

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: They (i.e., the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we
                            will.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: But you have a
                            problem with the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So far it’s
                            only with one committee.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Is he (Lord) your
                            assistant?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He is a
                            close associate and very discreet, so you can speak freely.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I read that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DN_1">Davis</persName> did not agree with your
                            policy. Is that true?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I
                            noticed you did not let him into Zaire.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: From the beginning
                            we tried to avoid misunderstanding. Neither he nor Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD_1">Hinton</persName> bettered our relations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Right. You
                            explained that to me at the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I informed Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD_1">Hinton</persName> that we wished to
                            separate ourselves from the Soviet Union, but he didn’t believe us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He didn’t
                            believe you and did not report it because he was afraid I might do what
                            I did. I did not understand the situation until the end of June, and
                            then we sent Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VSB_1">Vance</persName> to your
                            President and we began to understand.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I told my
                            President in March that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> was not aware of what was going on. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD_1">Hinton</persName> would say that the
                            Secretary of State said so and so, but I wondered. I gave the full
                            picture to him and also told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDB_1"
                                >Easum</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He didn’t
                            want to believe it either.</p>
                        <pb n="380" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_380"/>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I said that if we
                            were not careful the Soviets would send in squadrons and take over
                            Angola in six months. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EDB_1">Easum</persName>
                            was optimistic and even said that we should help the <gloss

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That was
                            foolish.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I told the
                            President that <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was not
                            aware of this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You were
                            right.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I saw President
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> last Monday.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He said that
                            he would support you.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: He will send a
                            military mission to Zaire and see what can be done. It is important that
                            you back him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I had dinner
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> yesterday
                            evening and he said he would send a mission to Kinshasa soon.<note n="2"

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: When?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Very soon,
                            in two to three weeks. He will also send helicopters. When I am back in
                            Washington we will go for new decisions to send you arms. Tell your
                            President not to lose courage.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: The other side is
                            using Katusha (?) [<hi rend="italic">Katyusha</hi>] rockets.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I talked to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> yesterday. He will
                            send helicopters with cannons and pilots, and the choppers will go after
                            the rockets.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Did you know that
                            Brazzaville has missiles?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We passed the
                            information. They are trying to frighten us. My President wants you to
                            send us some.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t
                            believe that you get frightened.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We are not scared.
                            We do need to boost the morale of the troops. Last Friday they blew up a
                            bridge. We believe the Soviets want to strangle us and that is why we
                            want help.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You will get
                            help in the next two weeks.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Material help is
                            the key. We need heavy weapons. They believe that the United States will
                            not intervene. When they hear the Congress, they are convinced the U.S.
                            won’t intervene.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Congress
                            is unbelievable.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We don’t
                            understand all the noise.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no
                            excuse. The major thing is that the Executive Branch is backing you.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I will tell my
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Tell your
                            President that I talked to President <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1"
                                >Giscard</persName>. He is looking for experts. We will finance. He
                            will get people, guns and helicopters.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: How about
                            missiles?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will look
                            into that.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: It is urgent. They
                            have Katushas (?) [<hi rend="italic">Katyusha</hi>] and are sometimes
                            firing 150 per hour.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They won’t
                            do that once you get helicopters on the battle field. When the rockets
                            are launched they will go after them with their guns.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: They have some
                            missiles.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Really?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Yes. Why don’t you
                            send missiles?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ll see
                            whether we can get the Redeye.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: It is very
                            important. We want to launch a counter offensive. There is already 5,000
                            people. We need support for the soldiers. Perhaps you could send
                            somebody to Kinshasa to deal with these problems.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. Can
                            Mr. Medwin(?) do it?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: He can. There is
                            the problem of Congress.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Congress
                            will be out of session and will do nothing for four weeks.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: They know about
                            the Americans who work there, even that there are eight.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that
                            true?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: It’s not
                            impossible. It’s better to have your own people rather than to have a
                            leak.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s
                            disgraceful. I have to admit it.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: I can’t understand
                            the collective masochism in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav Minister told me today that we should not worry, there is a
                            gentleman’s agreement between the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            and the USA and before that there will be fighting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no
                            such agreement. It’s not true.</p>
                        <p>We are thinking of publicly proposing a ceasefire and then stopping of
                            all outside arms. Shall we do this or not?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Yes, provided you
                            supply arms to Zaire.</p>
                        <pb n="382" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_382"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then there
                            would be no outside arms being sent to Angola.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We are inside. At
                            the same time diplomacy should be working.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If they
                            accept this proposal . . .</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: The Soviets won’t
                            leave. The Soviet Ambassador said that we have to continue bilateral
                            relations with them and that the Angola problem is an international
                            problem that we shouldn’t care about. We said, no, Angola is a problem
                            of security for Zaire and that comes first.</p>
                        <p>Our problem now is armament.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll do our
                            utmost to speed arms to Zaire the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: You should work
                            with European countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, France
                            for example.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: And Italy. You
                            have equipment in Europe. If they come to us with it, no one will see
                            American equipment, and we can prove to Congress that there is no
                            American involvement. I believe European countries are ready to help.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> will expect American
                            backing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: At dinner
                            last night I told him that America would back him.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: There’s Germany
                            too.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me see.
                            We will approach them.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: They have good
                            missiles, Roelants (?) [<hi rend="italic">Roland</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will have
                            to check. It is complicated but we will deal with it.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: For the time being
                            it is better to have the Executive deal through European countries.
                            Nobody will protest if France and Italy come to Zaire with American
                            armament. The other side has Russian T–54 tanks. (He then explained some
                            of the other side’s military objectives with regard to Cabinda, a
                            seaport, etc. and what his side was trying to do to organize against
                            this.) We are trying to counter the Soviet Union and we can’t let them
                            do all that they want.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will
                            counter them and not let them do what they want. First of all we will
                            send someone out to you with a concrete program. I will discuss this
                            with the President.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: He should give us
                            a program. It is a question of time. On Sunday I saw my President for a
                            discussion, and he asked me to tell you that the military situation is
                            very serious. The Katusha (?) [<hi rend="italic">Katyusha</hi>] rockets
                            are very powerful; the Germans were afraid of them during the war. We
                            have the men but cannot fight against it.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll get
                            some French planes in there.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: So you will send
                            someone next week?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Next
                            week is Christmas, so it will be at the end of next week or over the
                            weekend.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Tell my
                            Ambassador. We will try to have the Ambassador present his credentials
                            next week.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We thought we
                            should have a new Ambassador in Washington. What do you think?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s up to
                            you. I didn’t know the old one.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: The President is
                            happy with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1">Cutler</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We picked
                            the best man. We want you to be happy.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Have you briefed
                            him on Angola?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He knows
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: Can you help us
                            with communications?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That I am
                            sure we can do.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We are trying to
                            counteract the Nigerians.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why did they
                            recognize the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: They told me it
                            was because South Africa is inside Angola and they want to get them
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will get
                            them out when the Russians are out. We don’t want the South Africans in
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: For the time being
                            we don’t want them to get out. We will be Machiavellian. Let the South
                            Africans use their forces and we will then use this to get the Africans
                            to get the Russians out. That’s my opinion. Talk will not settle
                            anything. The Russians won’t leave. We’ll continue to attack South
                            Africa and we will condemn the Soviet Union too.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s what
                            you did at the last General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: And we will do the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Tell your

                        <p>(The Minister then briefly talked about the situation in Brazzaville. It
                            was agreed that Zaire would keep Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CWL_1"

                            will be comparing the Soviets to Hitler in 1939.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are a

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: History has no
                            place for losers. You once told me that.</p>

                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: We will continue
                            to attack the Soviet Union in speeches. Today I was talking about
                            imperialism in the West and in the East. The Yugoslavs are afraid of our
                            propaganda against the Soviet Union. I say that we have to do this. We
                            are convinced the Soviet Union is trying to destroy us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And that’s
                            why we are helping. We are only sorry that it took so long.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: We still think they should
                            stop fighting, and efforts toward a government of national unity should
                            be made. Some in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> believe one
                            group can win but we don’t. Because each one is entrenched <pb n="386"

                                >UNITA</gloss> is very popular in the South. And we believe Soviet
                            intervention is very dangerous and would set the whole area on fire.</p>
                        <p>All external forces should come out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Should we make such a
                            proposal?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: We would support that.</p>
                        <p>The Tanzanian government newspaper attacked our President today,
                            immediately after the visit of our President there yesterday. Our
                            President and Samora Michel visited there and we thought they had agreed
                            to stick to the common line.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you think that
                            means?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: It means we each have to
                            stick to our own position.</p>
                        <p>Our question is: Will you continue to see that Soviet arms are
                            balanced?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: In spite of the [reported
                            Senate subcommittee] vote?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. That was a
                            minority vote of one committee. We will see to it that the Soviet force
                            will be balanced, and then seek a negotiation.</p>
                        <p>You can tell your President that. We have made a decision for another

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: What about something

                        <p>So the vote won’t be steamrolled by one side.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We need your advice.
                            Make a proposal to us.</p>
                        <p>I wish in retrospect we had listened to your President when he was in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: What about a radio station?
                            They have a very powerful radio. We need one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll look into that.
                            That should be possible to do.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: If the <gloss

                            that point we will all call for the withdrawal of all Soviet, South
                            African and Cuban forces. Because the Soviets have been there and done
                            more work in training cadres, the other units may be at a disadvantage.
                            Could anything be done to train them?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Between now and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: And after.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The President of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: It will be necessary for

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are sending a
                            diplomatic note to every African country—except those that are
                            lost—about what we think about Soviet support and the <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: I talked to Mr. Garba of
                            Nigeria. He said there was pressure from you. I said we don’t see it
                            that way. I said we have had some notes which were very candid. While
                            the Soviets are really pressurizing us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do you explain
                            Tanzania?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: Tanzania sent a note to
                            Zambia and others and said it was because of South African involvement.
                            But Samora Michel said this decision should not have been arrived at
                            without consultation between heads of state. Mozambique was not happy
                            about it. According to our President, they agreed they would support the
                            call for all outsiders to get out.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia said they’d support it too. Should we believe that? They said
                            they’re there so the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> doesn’t go
                            totally Soviet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That may be partly
                            true.</p>
                        <p>I think your position is the correct one. You should stick to it. We will
                            balance the Soviet arms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: We will support a

                            and a government of national unity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Should we call a
                            Security Council meeting for that?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>: Wait for the summit
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>After 11 November we think it is legal according to the Charter to
                            consider that Angola is liberated and that all three liberation
                            movements are political parties; therefore, no state has the right to
                            choose one or the other. That is interference in its internal

                            rule. So this is the psychological moment to bring the greatest pressure

                        <p>The Secretary: The Department’s behavior on Angola is a disgrace. The
                            Department is leaking and showing a stupidity unfit for the Foreign
                            Service. No one can think that our interest there is because of the
                            Soviet base or the “untold riches” of Angola. This is not a whorehouse;
                            we are conducting national policy.</p>
                        <p>Just so that you may know my policy, we are interested in Angola because
                            the Soviets intervened 8,000 miles away and transformed the third
                            largest faction into the largest. All of the surrounding African states
                            are profoundly concerned with this development. Even Nigeria, <pb
                                n="390" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_390"/>which had to recognize the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> for basic domestic reasons,
                            is concerned. A US collapse will have the profoundest effect in Africa.
                            In Europe it will prove that the collapse in Vietnam was not an
                            aberration. In China—where the President, who is not in the Foreign
                            Service, two weeks ago told Mao that we would stand firm and induce them
                            to come back in through Zaire—the Chinese must be saying “we will
                                see.”<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">For the discussion between

                            which will ask themselves where can they not operate. Where indeed can
                            we stand up to them? The end result will not be an easing of tensions.
                            They want us to pull out of Angola and cut off grain sales as well. That
                            way, we’ll lose Angola and détente and six other places where we won’t
                            stand up—or one day we’ll get desperate and say “let’s clean out the
                            Russians.”</p>

                            an organization I was in. I’ll be gone eventually but you are people
                            whose loyalty is only to the promotion system and not to the US

                        <p>The Secretary: Let’s do the substance of it first. What was our strategy?
                            It was working. It was not to get a final victory but to balance off the
                            Soviets. Then to begin the diplomatic campaign in which the Soviets
                            risked their overall relations with us and then we’d get a coalition
                            government and withdraw all of the outside forces. In the illusion that
                            we would put in [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            more, I kicked it off in Detroit.<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4">During a

                            tie it in with my trip to Moscow as well and it was working. The Soviets

                            I think that is a good idea. Moreover, we have all of <gloss

                            help counteract what’s going through Brazzaville. The Zambians and
                            Zairians are panicked by our Congress. But our strategy was working.</p>
                        <p>Now you take the <persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> plan—or
                            your plan or whoever’s plan—the Department’s plan—what is wrong with it?
                            To do it under pressure will be read as a bug out. The plan is to go to
                            the Security Council and ask for a ceasefire and withdraw all the forces
                            within 30 days, to end all supplies. Under the present conditions, it
                            will guarantee an <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> victory. In
                            principle, I agree if we can spend [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                            plan. Then it becomes viable. But we have to shore up the countries
                            there first or they will all bug out. I’ve agreed with the President of
                            France that we will send messages to Gabon, to Cameroon and Zaire and
                            all of the states that his delegation visited to say that they should
                            hang in there and that we’re going to continue making an effort. I
                            promised the Foreign Minister of Zaire that we’d send someone there too.

                        <p>The Secretary: It’s really something. <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> went on national television. If the average person

                            mobilizing the public.</p>
                        <p>We have to try to wind it up by the end of January. We have to buck up
                            the Africans and move it to a resolution. If we do it the other way,
                            with the resolution before bucking them up, the Africans will bug
                            out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I think that’s
                            right.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If the next thing they hear is the <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName> cable about a ceasefire, they
                            will draw only one conclusion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: The plan was based on
                            first touching base with some of them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: 24 hours isn’t touching base. That’s just a propaganda
                            ploy. Is there any sense in that?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: No, first it will make
                            the Zairians and Zambians more nervous to hear that we’re working with
                            the Russians. Second, I don’t know what we can do with the Russians.
                            They have every incentive to wait it out unless we threaten dire
                            consequences across the board with out relations. I think the Senate
                            debate changes things. The only explanation we can make is that we’re
                            opposing the Soviets. But it’s not clear to the public what we’re trying
                            to do.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The withdrawal of all foreign troops will get the Zairians
                            and the South Africans out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Maybe you can talk
                            about “extra-continental forces.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But that leaves the South Africans in.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: We’re not expecting that
                            anything will happen.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I think we need to get the [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] Without that, we’re dead. Then get you
                            out there, Bill, to talk to these guys—explain it—we’ll put money and
                            then within about a week, say in late December, we’ll make our proposal.
                            We’ll call a Security Council meeting in early January. We can decide
                            the timing after your trip.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: That’s what they’re
                            looking at now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_IRS_1">Ingersoll</persName>: The mercenaries are
                            the biggest charge.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> said he’d
                            get a thousand mercenaries in two weeks. He says he’s got them but it
                            depends on getting a C–130 to get them there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: That’s been
                            offered.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: If we have the money, why not tell him to perform and keep
                            the foreign office out? Brent, I think you should send a cable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> saying we’ve
                            produced the messages to the Africans. They should just say we’ll hold
                            firm and balance the Soviet power and you’re coming to the area. They
                            should not be confused by our debate. Then later, that’s the time to

                            come back, we can do it.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: We have cowardly leaders but not such a bad record.
                            Everything you’ve put in your paper we’ve already proposed to the

                        <p>The Secretary: If we could get some gunships in within 72 hours, it would
                            help the Zairians. They are in a state of shock.</p>

                        <p>The Soviets have become a superpower. Before World War I, the emergence

                            emergence of the Soviets to a superpower status without a war. We are
                            being deprived of both the carrot and the stick. We will lose Angola and
                            then they will want us to cut off grain to the Soviet Union. We are

                        <p>The considerations of the President on Angola in his talk with the Soviet
                            Ambassador were attentively studied in Moscow.<note n="2"

                        <p>We, as the President, cannot of course be but concerned by the attempts
                            of certain circles within and outside the United States to use the <pb
                                n="397" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_397"/>events in this African country
                            for bringing complications into the Soviet-American relations.</p>
                        <p>Since there is no real foundation, as we are convinced, for such a turn
                            of events, the task consequently is not to give the upper hand to these
                            attempts. And here a considered, sound approach is needed including in
                            the public statements which have been made in connection with the
                            Angolan affairs.</p>
                        <p>As to the considerations of the President concerning the ways of ending
                            the war and establishing peace in Angola, the Soviet Union, as we
                            already told the American side, never has been and could not be a
                            champion of unleashing a civil war in that country. We would only
                            welcome such type of actions which would aim at consolidating in Angola
                            all the forces striving for real independence and free development of
                            their country.</p>
                        <p>The case, however, is, that what is happening in Angola is not simply an
                            “internal strife”, but a direct military intervention, in particular, on
                            the part of the Republic of South Africa, with the use of both the
                            foreign mercenaries and splinter groupings inside Angola who tied
                            themselves to foreign interests alien to the people of Angola.</p>
                        <p>It would be unjustified to equate foreign interventionists, who use as
                            their tool separatist groups in Angola, with the lawful Government of
                            that country, who are fighting back the intervention, and consequently
                            to equate those who are helping the interventionists with those who are
                            supporting the lawful Government.</p>
                        <p>That is why it seems to us unjustified and unjust to make an appeal for
                            cessation of hostilities in Angola to all belligerent parties there,
                            thus putting on the same level the interventionists and the patriotic
                            forces headed by the lawful Government of the Peoples Republic of
                            Angola. What should be pursued now is the end of foreign military
                            intervention in that country so that its people could in reality be
                            ensured the right to decide by themselves the questions of building new
                            life in conditions of independence and freedom without any interference
                            from outside.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union continues to be ready to make an appropriate official
                            statement. We would welcome such a statement also on the part of the
                            United States, as well as its practical actions leading towards the
                            above goal.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion we would like to underline once again that the President
                            can rest assured that the Soviet side is in no way interested in having
                            the events in Angola viewed from the angle of “confrontation between
                            Moscow and Washington” and as “a test of the policy of relaxation of
                            tension”.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>In light of our conversation earlier this week,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d155fn2">Not further identified; see <ref target="#d149fn2"

                            meeting and the Angolan situation with President <persName

                            know what our plans are.</p>
                        <p>We will be sending instructions today to our Ambassadors in Zaire, Gabon,
                            the Ivory Coast, Zambia, Liberia, and Senegal, directing them to
                            emphasize with their host governments our support for the <gloss

                                >UNITA</gloss> and urging them to use their influence to prevent
                            further recognition of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.<note

                        <p>As I informed you in our meeting, we have informed Zaire that we will be
                            prepared to match Soviet military aid.</p>
                        <p>Early next week, I will be sending Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> to Zaire, Zambia, the Ivory
                            Coast, and Gabon to assure them of our continuing support. I would be
                            pleased to have him visit any other countries you may think are
                            appropriate.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the provision of helicopter gunships for use in Angola, I
                            wanted you to know that we have informed your government [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] of our
                            willingness to provide a C–130 aircraft for transportation and support
                            of the helicopters. It is my understanding that we are now awaiting a
                            final decision from your government on this joint project. Perhaps you
                            could expedite initiation of this activity.</p>
                        <p>I also wanted you to know that the debate in this country will not affect
                            our immediate plans. We are still in a position to provide further
                            support and intend to do so. If we can maintain the local military
                            balance over the next few weeks, we will be in a position to make a
                            political move to put pressure on the Soviet Union. We will want to
                            consult closely with you over this critical period.</p>
                        <p>Warm regards.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: We weren’t. It’s the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Should we raise a

                            and that you will be coming to discuss how we can continue to meet our
                            mutual objectives. There should be a similar cable to the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: But could we make the

                            money from a foreign country?</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary: I just saw Senator (McClellan?) on television saying
                            that the Senate amendment would bar us from funding the [<hi

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LM_1">Leigh</persName>: Legally, I don’t think that
                            is sound. The Congress appropriates money, but the President makes
                            foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: The first task is to preclude panic in those countries. Then
                            we consider how to get the money.<note n="4" xml:id="d156fn4">See <ref

                            a pittance for them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: It would make sense for
                            us to use our money to buy equipment, then use the Saudi money for
                            mercenaries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We should use our [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                            through, we can use it for mercenaries. If it doesn’t, we will have the
                            hardware. The Saudis were willing to give [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] to Vietnam—a year of oil imports
                            free.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Zaire has a serious
                            oil problem too. They are running out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: They want about [<hi

                            enough to tide them over about four months.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We can’t ask the Saudis for one thing, and then another. It
                            would soon be up to [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p>Secretary: I don’t agree. The Zairian Foreign Minister told me the best
                            outcome would be for the South Africans to take all of Angola and then
                            for Zaire to get the credit for pushing them out.<note n="6"

                            The Nigerian Foreign Minister didn’t make much of the South Africans
                            when I talked to him but said it presented a domestic problem for

                        <p>Secretary: Nonsense. There is no problem if the South Africans win and
                            then get out afterwards. The problem is a domestic one for us. That
                            makes any discussion of supporting the South Africans unrealistic.</p>

                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>You should request immediate meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to pass on to him message on Angola from the
                            Secretary based on following talking points.</p>
                        <p>1) We greatly appreciate staunch support which Zaire continues to provide
                            for realization our common objectives and Secretary welcomed opportunity
                            to exchange views with Commissioner of State for Foreign Affairs
                                <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName>: in Paris.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d158fn2">See <ref target="#d149">Document
                            149</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>2) The President should know that despite the recent Congressional
                            discussions here, we still have sufficient funds available to continue
                            our program of resistance to Soviet intervention over the imme<pb
                                n="405" facs="0444" xml:id="pg_405"/>diate period ahead. And, we
                            will have a new opportunity to go back to the Congress for additional
                            funds in January.</p>
                        <p>3) We want to assure <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> that
                            U.S. determination to continue to resist Soviet attempt to implant
                            itself in Angola has not diminished. We have undisbursed funds still
                            available and we are looking at other options if they prove
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>4) We believe that only through continued resistance to the Soviet
                            intervention can we hope to achieve the solution we seek. Therefore in
                            close collaboration with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            and others we will meet the present challenge. This is a critical period
                            in which we must keep a steady course.</p>
                        <p>5) We urge <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and his
                            government to continue its effective assistance to the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6) In addition, during the interim before January <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> meeting on Angola, we suspect
                                pro-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> African states may make
                            concerted drive to increase number of African states recognizing <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to point that, by sheer numbers,
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> decisions will be determined by
                            them. Since our common position is to achieve negotiated solution within
                            purely Angolan and African context the success of such a drive could
                            produce exactly opposite result. It would be better to avoid any <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> action if it likely to be adverse. We
                            strongly urge that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            redouble his efforts, during this uncertain and possibly decisive
                            period, to block possibility of further African recognition of <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7) As the Secretary mentioned to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName> in Paris, he would like his new
                            Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWE_1">William Schaufele</persName>, to travel to Zaire
                            next week for discussions with the President on the situation in Angola.
                            The Secretary believes it is essential at this time to maintain our
                            common strategy towards Angola, and would welcome the opportunity for
                            such an exchange of views if the President believes it would be
                            useful.</p>

                        <p>Please pass the following oral message from the Secretary to the Shah.
                            Please do not leave any piece of paper.</p>
                        <p>1. You have been asked by the Secretary to discuss the Angolan situation
                            with the Shah. We want him to know that despite the Congressional debate
                            on funds for covert support in Angola, there are sufficient resources in
                            the pipe-line to maintain our support for some time. This will allow the
                            Executive Branch to make further efforts when the Congress returns in
                            January to get the kind of additional financial support which will be
                            required. The point to get across to the Shah is that we are not out of
                            business, and that the Executive Branch is resolved to pursue the Angola
                            matter vigorously and with full determination. We do not intend to sit
                            idly by in the face of Soviet intervention.</p>
                        <p>2. We want the Shah to know that our principal concern in this matter is
                            the one that would concern him most—namely, that a Soviet power play in
                            the heart of Africa not be permitted to succeed unchallenged with all
                            the implications of successful Soviet adventurism in Africa as well as
                            globally. We intend to do everything possible to continue our support of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> through Zaire, and we will also in
                            our discussions with the Soviets, making clear to them that their
                            involvement in Angola will inevitably raise questions about détente.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary wants to make clear what our purpose is in Angola. We
                            are not against the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> per se; our
                            interests in Angola per se are only marginal; but it is the Soviet
                            challenge which is uppermost in our mind. Our purpose is a limited
                            one—to support the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> in order to create a military
                            stand-off on the ground which would help promote a peaceful settlement
                            among the three factions looking towards the establishment of a
                            coalition government. We also favor the end of all outside intervention
                            and would be prepared to stop our support provided the Soviets do
                            likewise, and we support the removal of all outside forces in such
                            circumstances—Cubans, South Africans, and Zairois—leaving the Angolans
                            to settle the matter peacefully among and between themselves.</p>
                        <p>4. In view of the parallel interests which Iran and the US share in this
                            matter, we want to share our assessment that the next six or eight <pb
                                n="407" facs="0446" xml:id="pg_407"/>weeks will be crucial. It is
                            important that the support for the non-communist factions continue.</p>
                        <p>5. In light of the foregoing you should see if the Shah would find it
                            feasible to make available funds to Zaire for additional equipment and
                            arms which would help preserve the kind of military position for the
                            non-communist forces which is essential if a negotiated settlement is to
                            be achieved. You should stress that we are not seeking funding for our
                            own programs and could not accept such funds. What we are suggesting is
                            additional financial support that would go directly to Zaire for support
                            of <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss>. If the Shah is disposed to be helpful—and we hope
                            that he is—it would be important to move promptly. Therefore you should
                            indicate that we would be prepared to discuss specifically how such
                            funds channelled to Zaire could be used most effectively. We believe an
                            additional total of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] is needed. You may tell the Shah that we are
                            approaching the Saudis along the same lines.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> sent a
                                similar message to Jidda, December 20. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                        <p>6. With respect to the Iranian inquiry about transferring
                            American-supplied equipment to Zaire, you should explain that we have
                            difficulties on this. In the context of our present debate with the
                            Congress on this subject and our intent to go back to the Congress again
                            in January, we do not believe that we could concur now in an action
                            which would have to be reported to the Congress and which would be seen
                            by Congressional critics as a move to circumvent Congressional views on
                            US involvement in Angola. That is why we are discussing with the
                            Iranians—as with the Saudis—other possible ways for them to contribute
                            directly through Zaire to a strengthening of the non-communist forces in
                            Angola.</p>
                        <p>7. Please report your conversation promptly in this channel.</p>

                                meeting between <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName>
                                and <persName corresp="#p_CF_1">Carlucci</persName> to discuss “the
                                problem of the U.S. Congress and Angola.” During the meeting,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo Antunes</persName> “expressed
                                concern” over Soviet involvement in the region and offered to
                                collaborate with the United States on Angola. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CF_1">Carlucci</persName> suggested to the
                                Department that collaboration with Portugal in the following areas
                                might be useful: intelligence, diplomatic action with African
                                nations, and informing others of the “nature of the threat.”
                                (Ibid.)</note></p>
                        <p>1. We welcome offer by FonMin <persName corresp="#p_AEM_1">Melo
                                Antunes</persName> to be helpful in Angolan situation. You may tell
                            him that despite current adverse attitude in Congress that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is determined to push ahead with
                            resistance to Soviet power grab in Angola. Furthermore we are taking
                            further steps in examining promising options to block any deterioration
                            on the ground or elsewhere in Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Specifically we are protesting to those governments which have
                            provided overflight and refueling rights to Soviet or Cuban aircraft
                            carrying arms, equipment and personnel to Angola. In this connection we
                            are concerned that Cubans, now that Barbados refueling stop has been
                            denied them and Trinidad and Tobago has refused permission, may request
                            similar facilities through Azores. We believe it essential that such a
                            request be denied. We estimate number of Cuban troops already in Angola
                            at 5,000 or more. Presence is enormously destabilizing and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> could make important contribution by
                            denying use of Azores to Cuban planes ferrying either troops or military
                            supplies to Africa for Angola or returning from there even if empty.</p>
                        <p>3. We also taking various diplomatic initiatives including direct
                            approach to the Soviets.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3">See <ref

                                    >145</ref>.</note> While we are not opposed to <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> per se we continue to believe that
                            there must be a negotiated settlement in Angola permitting all three
                            movements equitable representation in some form of coalition government.
                            We fully support <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> efforts to this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>4. We would welcome <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> intelligence on
                            Angola. We understand there is a Portuguese liaison group of some kind
                            in Luanda and would appreciate any information about <gloss

                            political, economic and military situation.</p>
                        <p>5. We would welcome <gloss target="#t_GOP_1">GOP</gloss> efforts with
                            African countries which it can influence to (A) dissuade them from
                            recognizing <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and (B) acquaint them
                            with the nature of the threat. Our information indicates following have

                            is to facilitate the recruitment of mercenaries. However [<hi

                        <p>1. Went carefully over ref message with Shah in early evening audience
                            December 21.</p>
                        <p>His initial reaction was to ask whether you would meet with <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH_1">Ansary</persName> before Christmas. (My inquiry as
                            to what he meant led to semantic exchange during which it became clear
                            that he was speaking of Quote Christmas holiday period Unquote). He then
                            went on to say that if his government gets sufficient funds, he would
                            like very much to help. He wants to know from us how much Saudis will
                            contribute so that he can Quote complement Unquote their amount and thus
                            conceivably bring it up to the [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p>2. Shah told me he had had conversation in last few days with Soviet
                            Ambassador Erofeev during which Angola situation had been discussed.
                            Erofeev regaled Shah with Russian recognition of <gloss

                            response to query, he told Shah that Cubans were Quote volunteers
                            Unquote. Shah embarrassed Erofeev by saying to him, Quote oh I see.
                            Those Cubans have their planes and big weapons at home with them at all

                            by saying Quote I took the same position as your government on the

                        <p>4. Saudi Arabia will determine, in concert with Egypt and Iran, how much

                            about Angola. The vote in the Senate on Angola was, to say the least,

                            Without specifying countries involved, other than in general area of
                            Middle East, you should inform President that we are encouraged to

                        <p>1. [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] the South African
                            National Security Council decided on the evening of 23 December to
                            withdraw South African troops from Angola. The timing of the withdrawal
                            is not definite pending consultations beginning 24 December with the
                            National Front for the Liberation of Angola (<gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>), the National Union for the Total Independence of
                            Angola (<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>), and possibly with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. [<hi
                                rend="italic">1½ lines not declassified</hi>] emphasized that the
                            withdrawal will be orderly, and that the service hoped to obtain the
                            concurrence of the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] the South
                            Africans probably intend to withdraw before the Organization of African
                            Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>) meeting now scheduled for
                            the second week in January. By withdrawing before the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> meeting, the South Africans hope that
                                <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> will be free to deny the presence of
                            South Africans in Angola and to invite on-site inspection. The South
                            African withdrawal timetable might be adjusted, depending upon the
                            results of consultations with the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"

                        <p>11014. For the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_MEW_1"
                                >Mulcahy</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName>. Subject: Angola: Meeting with Mosutu.</p>
                        <p>1. I met with President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            for an hour and a half this morning, December 27, at his country
                            residence. Also present were his chief advisor, Bisengimana, Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName> and Ambassador
                            Cutler.</p>
                        <p>2. I began by explaining the purpose of my trip: to consult personally
                            with several key African leaders on Angola, to explain our position and
                            assure them of our continued resolve to oppose foreign intervention, and
                            to exchange views on ways by which the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> might facilitate a negotiated settlement in Angola. I
                            said we wanted to consult with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> as a first step, and then reviewed with him the
                            substance of the points which I intend to make with the governments I
                            would be visiting. I said I would also be seeing a number of our
                            Ambassadors from other African countries and would instruct them to make
                            the same points to their respective host governments. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> expressed agreement with my
                            presentation and satisfaction that we were taking such an initiative at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to our own efforts in Angola, I said that despite
                            problems with the Congress we remained determined to resist Soviet
                            military intervention until a peaceful solution could be worked out. I
                            noted that the issue had by no means been played out in the Congress,
                            and if necessary the administration was prepared to renew the battle
                            when Congress reconvenes next month. For now, however, we have
                            sufficient funds to meet present military requirements.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> said the Congress’
                            action posed serious problems, both from the standpoint of limiting
                            prospects for additional help and the adverse effect on the attitudes
                            and will of others trying to help. Of even greater concern, he went on,
                            was the question of Zaire’s own security in the face of Soviet threats
                            not only to the south in Angola but also on other sides—in Cabinda and
                            Congo Brazzaville. While the Soviets poured military equipment into
                            those areas Zaire remained essentially unprotected: none of the
                            country’s vital areas—Inga Dam, the copper belt, the capital, the
                            ports—had any protection from military attack. <pb n="416" facs="0455"
                                xml:id="pg_416"/>Nor did Zaire have any means for making its own
                            armaments. While the Soviet Union and its friends “guaranteed” continued
                            support “until the end” to those threatening Zaire’s security, Zaire had
                            no such assurances. I expressed understanding of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s concerns, assured him we
                            would continue to do our best to help, and discussed in this context our
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> and economic assistance
                            programs for the coming year.</p>
                        <p>5. I then turned to the urgent matter of preventing any additional
                            recognitions of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> before the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit, noting that Zaire was
                            in a position to play a key role in this effort and that we, for our
                            part, were ready to lend support in any way possible. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> reiterated his belief that no
                            more than twenty African states will have recognized the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> by the time the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> convenes, leaving a clear majority
                            with which to work at the meeting. He conceded, however, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and its backers were waging a
                            vigorous campaign which had to be watched carefully. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> blamed Algeria in particular
                            for trying to drum up support for <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            in the name of “non-alignment.” We then reviewed the status of
                            individual states: Cameroon was shaky but visits by both <persName
                                corresp="#p_MBN_1">Bula</persName> and me during the next few days
                            should help. Chad was also doubtful, but <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> (working through <persName corresp="#p_BO_1"
                                >Bongo</persName>) had assured them of some military assistance as a
                            counter to the Soviets’ help. The Nigerians, I said, were worth
                            continued attention since, despite their recognition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, they had told us they still
                            supported the idea of a coalition government; <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> agreed. On the other hand,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> thought Ghana had
                            caved because of Nigerian pressure and was not salvageable.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> was obviously concerned
                            about developments in Washington and their effects on both the Angolan
                            effort and our ability to continue contributing to Zaire’s own security.
                            However, he was not discouraged and seemed readily to accept my
                            assurances that we have every intention of staying in the game. Somewhat
                            to my surprise, he did not raise the question of South African forces in
                                Angola,<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">See <ref target="#d165">Document
                                    165</ref>.</note> as I thought he might with a view to seeking
                            our intercession to keep them there. While we did not get into the
                            substance of <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>’s views on a
                            possible <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> settlement—and I am not
                            sure his thinking has progressed very far along this line or that he
                            concerns himself with such details—it is clear that he views the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit as a major challenge, and
                            opportunity, for movement on the political front. (He did point out that
                            the heavily armed and equipped position of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> forces makes cease-fire disadvantageous for the other
                            movements and Zaire.) It is also clear that he shares our concern for
                            holding the line on <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> recognition
                            before the summit. In this connection, Foreign Min<pb n="417"

                                >Bula</persName> will be sent shortly to Zambia and Uganda, as well
                            as Cameroon, to maintain pressure on this issue.</p>
                        <p>7. I am convinced that, while we can continue to count on Zaire in the
                            military sphere, we cannot look to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to provide the major impetus for effectively
                            organizing political/diplomatic efforts among friendly African states
                            prior to or during the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> meeting.</p>

                            Angola in Addis Ababa on January 8. The meeting is bound to be a
                            contentious one. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
                                (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>) and its supporters will
                            seek to:</p>
                        <p>—gain for it official recognition from the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> as the sovereign government of Angola,</p>
                        <p>—win condemnation of South African and US involvement in Angola,</p>
                        <p>—justify Soviet and Cuban assistance,</p>

                            forced to “choose up sides.” This group of states will attempt to
                            encourage a political settlement among the factions within Angola
                            by:</p>

                        <p>3. The presence of South African combat forces in Angola has given the

                        <p>—Pretoria’s assistance makes it emotionally impossible for most black
                            African states to remain neutral and makes it politically difficult if
                            not impossible for most to support a government of national unity.</p>
                        <p>—South African support of <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> has seriously tarnished the
                            image of these organizations as legitimate Angolan nationalist groups in
                            the eyes of many African nations.</p>
                        <p>—Pretoria’s involvement in Angola was the deciding factor in prompting
                            Nigeria, Ghana and Burundi to recognize the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>. A South African presence in Angola at the time of the
                            summit will prompt other African states to follow suit, and probably
                            produce a majority in favor of recognizing the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members will also be keenly
                            sensitive to how the fighting in Angola is going. Should it appear that
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> were on the verge of gaining
                            a clear-cut position of predominance or that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> coalition were collapsing, some <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> states would probably move quickly to
                            recognize the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, in effect getting
                            on what appeared to be the winning side. As matters now stand, however,
                            it does not appear that the fighting will be at such a point before the
                            summit occurs. The <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> has stepped up
                            its activities, but no decisive breakthrough appears imminent. Moreover,
                            the rainy season is now underway in Angola, and this should serve to
                            complicate military action.</p>
                        <p>5. Pretoria has recently indicated privately that it plans to withdraw
                            its forces from Angola by the time the summit begins.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d167fn2">See <ref target="#d165">Document 165</ref>.</note>
                            If this is in fact a firm decision and some way can be found to make it
                            credible to the African audience and to make diplomatic use of it, it
                            would strengthen the position of African countries that were prepared to
                            hold off on recognition of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            until some steps could be taken toward a political settlement. Such a
                            development might also stimulate diplomatic efforts by “neutrals” or
                                <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> supporters to promote a compromise solution. Indeed,
                            such follow-up would probably be nec<pb n="419" facs="0458"
                                xml:id="pg_419"/>essary if <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> were to gain
                            any benefit from South African withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>6. Since Pretoria has not announced a decision to withdraw, <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> supporters may try to use the issue of withdrawal as
                            a lever to pry concessions out of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> side, either at the summit or in the preceding
                            diplomatic activity. It is difficult to foretell the success of such
                            efforts. On the one hand, the prospect of bargaining over Pretoria’s
                            presence might make some <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            supporters dig in more; on the other hand, some might think more
                            seriously about a compromise solution. One factor influencing the
                            situation would be whether or not those Africans who are neutrals or at
                            least not hard-core <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> supporters endorsed the idea of
                            bargaining over South African withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>7. South African withdrawal before the opening of the summit would put
                            moderate <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members in a better
                            position to insist on withdrawal of all foreign forces from Angola. It
                            would also markedly reduce the chance of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> officially endorsing the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. Even with a South African withdrawal, however, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> would continue to charge that <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss> were obtaining clandestine assistance from Pretoria,
                            and such an accusation would have some credibility because of South
                            Africa’s past support. Similar criticism would also be directed against
                            the US. In addition, a South African withdrawal would also serve to
                            persuade the Luanda-based regime to step up military operations in order
                            to take advantage of the damaging effect a withdrawal would have on the
                            military capabilities of its rivals.</p>
                        <p>9. In any event, the best that <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> can probably expect is
                            that a stampede of recognitions for the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> can be averted at the summit and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> reaches no formal decision as a body.
                            There would then be some chance that a number of African states would
                            become disenchanted with the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>’s
                            refusal to agree to a government of national unity, and that this, in
                            turn, would create new possibilities for a future political settlement.
                            Even this evolution of events is questionable, however, unless South
                            Africa actually withdraws from Angola.</p>
                        <p>10. In the week ahead, ongoing diplomatic activity will assume great
                            importance. Among the several areas where there could be some movement
                            are:</p>
                        <p>—Zambian efforts to persuade Mozambique, Tanzania, and perhaps other
                                pro-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> states to accept a
                            government of national unity. It is possible that the Zambians are
                            trying to use South African withdrawal as a bargaining chip.</p>
                        <p>—Efforts by governments sympathetic to <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> or to
                            reconciliation (e.g., Senegal, Ivory Coast) to hold the line among
                            like-minded states and line up additional support from fence
                            sitters.</p>
                        <pb n="420" facs="0459" xml:id="pg_420"/>
                        <p>—The continuing attempts by pro-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            states to turn the accumulation of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> strength into a bandwagon. The caucus of states
                            recognizing the Luanda regime, which will reportedly meet just before
                            the summit, will be one such effort.</p>
                        <p>A critical point will be whether or not the divisions among states
                            recognizing the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> may be
                            sufficiently wide to affect the outcome of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> meeting. Some states recognizing the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, such as Nigeria and Ghana, appear
                            to be primarily concerned about the South African role and if they could
                            get some satisfaction on that point, might support a serious compromise
                            effort. There will be great efforts made, however, to hold the <gloss

                        <p>Quote Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>As the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit approaches I would
                            like to share with you some of my thoughts on the Angolan problem. I
                            hope that you will feel <pb n="421" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_421"/>free to
                            give me your own, as well as any further suggestions you may have
                            concerning further initiatives that might be undertaken by you or by my
                            government to promote a settlement in Angola that does not leave that
                            country in the hands of the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>My government remains determined to support the <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1"
                                >FNLA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> forces in
                            Angola until the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> is convinced it
                            must negotiate and precipitate the withdrawal of their Soviet and Cuban
                            support for the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. We intend to
                            utilize the means which are still available to us in the most effective
                            way to enable us to continue and increase our present efforts. The vote
                            in the Senate on December 19 was primarily directed against covert
                            assistance and, should it be necessary, we will renew our efforts to
                            obtain wider Congressional backing for additional resources to block
                            Soviet and Cuban intervention in Angola’s internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>On the South African question, about which there has been so much concern
                            in Africa, I believe you are aware that the US in no way sought or
                            encouraged the South Africans to become involved in Angola nor was our
                            advice sought. It is reasonable to assume that they acted in defense of
                            their national interest as they see it. We did not initiate any
                            consultation with them and have maintained our military embargo on all
                            arms to South Africa. Our desire is that a negotiated solution can be
                            found so that all intervention—Soviet, Cuban and South African—ceases.
                            We are confident that once Cuban and Soviet forces are withdrawn the
                            weight of world opinion will bring about a withdrawal of South African
                            forces as well.</p>
                        <p>The upcoming <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit meeting on
                            Angola can clearly be extremely important in promoting an early end to
                            the fighting and a peaceful settlement of the civil war. It is our hope
                            that through your efforts and those of like-minded chiefs of state the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> will insist upon a prompt end
                            to all foreign involvement in Angola, arrange a standstill ceasefire
                            between the forces in Angola, and bring about negotiations among the
                            Angolan groups. My government would support such an initiative and
                            cooperate with it, provided other distant powers do so as well. We would
                            also in that case urge South Africa to end its involvement. I wish again
                            to assure you, however, that we cannot stand idly by if the Soviet and
                            Cuban intervention persists.</p>
                        <p>I would hope we can continue to exchange views on this and other matters
                            of mutual concern as the need for further consultation arises.

                        <p>Moscow, naturally, continues to follow closely the developments in Angola
                            and in this regard is ready to maintain an appropriate contact with the
                            American side.</p>
                        <p>We have in respect of Angola one clear and consistent policy. If we say
                            that the Soviet Union is against foreign interference in the affairs of
                            Angola, we say it to everyone and publicly too.</p>
                        <p>It is important, certainly, to discern a clear dividing line between a
                            real interference in the affairs of Angola, meaning the military
                            intervention of the Republic of South Africa and the actions of her
                            accomplices, and the support rendered by many states to the lawful
                            government of that country precisely for putting an end to such
                            interference, for securing freedom, independence and territorial
                            integrity of Angola.</p>
                        <p>When the foreign interference—not the fictitious but the real one—in the
                            affairs of the sovereign state of Angola is stopped and the people of
                            Angola get an opportunity to manage by themselves their affairs, then,
                            it goes without saying, there will be no need to render them assistance
                            in the form required by and granted to the People’s Republic of Angola
                            now. Then the question about anybody’s “military presence” in Angola
                            will solve itself in a natural way.</p>
                        <p>That is the principled position of the Soviet Union. It is our deep
                            belief that it contains nothing which would hurt anybody’s interests
                            including those of the United States. Therefore it cannot and should not
                            lead to any complications in the Soviet-American relations.</p>
                        <p>We would like to hope that the United States will not permit rash actions
                            in connection with Angola, including actions against countries rendering
                            assistance to her lawful government, which could really complicate both
                            the Soviet-American relations and the cause of relaxation in
                            general.</p>

                        <p>We have studied with great care the communication from Moscow concerning
                            Angola which was delivered to us on January 9.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d170fn2"><ref target="#d169">Document 169</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>We do not propose to engage with the Soviet side in further disputations
                            about “fictitious” or “real” foreign interference in Angolan affairs, we
                            will evidently not agree on this matter. Our purpose is to have foreign
                            interference ended, whatever characterization is applied to it. In that
                            regard, we have noted with interest the statements in the Soviet
                            communication concerning the military intervention of South Africa. It
                            appears from these statements that the Soviet side now envisages the
                            termination of all foreign military presence in Angola when the above
                            military intervention has ended. We consider this Soviet position to be
                            significant. For its part the US is willing to use its influence to
                            bring about the cessation of foreign intervention. At the same time, we
                            would appreciate having explicit confirmation from Moscow that the
                            Soviet side will end its own military role as well as seeing to it that
                            the military role of Cuba, with which the Soviet role is inextricably
                            linked, will also end. The Soviet communication states that this problem
                            will “solve itself in a natural way.” It will be important to know
                            Moscow’s view as to the time frame in which such a solution, that is,
                            the termination of Soviet and Cuban military presence and activity in
                            Angola, would take place after South African withdrawal has been
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>We would like to be certain that there is complete understanding in
                            Moscow of our fundamental view of the Angolan issue, as it has evolved
                            in recent months.</p>
                        <p>Angola would never have become a critical issue in American-Soviet
                            relations if there had not been massive infusions of Soviet and Cuban
                            military equipment and forces into the country. We have proceeded from
                            the assumption that the essence of our relationship, if it is to proceed
                            along the lines mapped out in the discussions and understandings of
                            1972–74, is that neither side will seek to obtain positions of
                            unilateral advantage vis-à-vis the other, that restraint will govern our
                            respective policies, and that nothing will be done that could escalate
                            situations, where there may be turbulence or instability for other
                            reasons, into confrontations between our two countries.</p>
                        <pb n="424" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_424"/>
                        <p>It has been our view that these principles of mutual relations were not
                            simply a matter of abstract “good will” but that they are at the very
                            heart of how two responsible great powers must conduct their relations
                            in the nuclear era. For it must be clear that where great powers are
                            concerned, when either one succeeds somehow to obtain a special position
                            of influence based on military intervention, in some locale because of
                            certain temporary political opportunities and irrespective of original
                            motives, the other power will sooner or later act to offset this
                            advantage. But this will inevitably lead to a chain of action and
                            reaction that was typical of other historic eras in which great powers
                            maneuvered for advantage only to find themselves sooner or later
                            embroiled in major crises and, indeed, open conflict.</p>
                        <p>But it is precisely this pattern that we sought to break.</p>
                        <p>Whatever justification, be it as a matter of “principle” or in real or
                            alleged requests for assistance, the Soviet side may consider itself to
                            have had in intervening itself and actively supporting the Cuban
                            intervention in Angola, the fact remains that there has never been any
                            historic Soviet, or Russian, interest in that part of the world. It is
                            precisely because the United States respects the position of the Soviet
                            Union as a great power that it was bound to see the Soviet move into
                            Angola, whatever the motivation, as running counter to the crucial
                            principles of restraint, eschewal of unilateral advantage and scrupulous
                            concern for the interests of others which we jointly enunciated in the
                            early seventies.</p>
                        <p>It is not for us to lecture the Soviet side about its own interests. But
                            we cannot help observing that whatever the attitudes of the African
                            states with respect to South African intervention and in regard to the
                            three contending factions in Angola, all the major African states view
                            with utmost dismay the establishment of a Soviet/Cuban military position
                            in the region of southwest Africa. Moreover, the Soviet side must be
                            aware also that the steady trend toward a normalization of American
                            relations with Cuba, which we had initiated not least in order to
                            further the process of normalizing US-Soviet relations, has been most
                            seriously damaged by what has happened in Angola. We believe that this
                            is a wholly unnecessary setback to the constructive trends in our
                            relations to which we jointly committed ourselves and we cannot believe
                            that this is ultimately in the Soviet interest.</p>
                        <p>It is against the background of these very fundamental considerations,
                            going to the very heart of our relations and indeed of a peaceful world
                            order, that Moscow should evaluate our position on Angola. And that is
                            why the speedy clarifications of Soviet policies and intentions for
                            which we are asking in the first part of this message are of such vital
                            importance. We believe there remains time and opportunity for the kind
                            of statesmanship, on both sides, that will avoid our two coun<pb n="425"

                            African states at the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit, but
                            recognize they will probably be under renewed pressure from pro-<gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> radicals to shift their position in
                            the name of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> unity. We also
                            anticipate that the radicals will prefer to blame us rather than African
                            states for split at the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, thereby
                            keeping door open to moderates to “return to the African fold.” Some
                            countries, however, particularly those recently visited by Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>, may be
                            singled out for abuse as “American lackeys” who split the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> at Washington’s bidding.</p>
                        <p>2. We will need, therefore, to be as supportive of our African friends as
                            we can in the coming crucial weeks but we will also need to do so
                            discreetly in ways which will not over-identify them with us. Rather
                            than relying on top-level correspondence that may leak, or visits, at
                            least at this time by high US officials, we will look to each of you to
                            maintain a discreet dialogue following up on the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit and developments in Angola.</p>
                        <p>3. It will clearly be crucial in the coming weeks that the moderate
                            states continue to display the leadership and unity which they
                            demonstrated at Addis. To encourage them to think in these terms, you
                            should seek an early appointment with the highest appropriate official
                            to follow up on the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit and
                            developments in Angola. You <pb n="426" facs="0465" xml:id="pg_426"
                            />should express your gratification at seeing the moderates of Africa
                            for once so united and effective in defense of their principles, and
                            argue that the battle is only just starting. Now it will become even
                            more essential, but also difficult for the moderates to act together to
                            blunt pro-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> efforts to gain
                            recognition. You should also encourage your host leadership to go on the
                            offensive, using their prestige and resources to rally <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> members in support of a policy of
                            conciliation.</p>
                        <p>4. You should encourage host government official to discuss options
                            facing us all in light of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> standoff
                            and try and elicit:</p>
                        <p>—Any playback of impressions from the summit (including who were the main
                            driving force on the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>-side, who
                            were the compromisers, what was the role of the Cubans, did the Soviets
                            play any roles)?</p>
                        <p>—What is host government’s estimate of the recognition situation
                            (stalemate, continued danger of more recognitions of <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, likelihood someone will recognize
                            the “Huambo government”)?</p>
                        <p>—Are there any plans for further coordination among the anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> grouping? What is moderates’ next
                            step?</p>
                        <p>—Are there any specific steps which host government can suggest which
                            might be taken by moderate African states and/or by us which would help
                            build pressure for a withdrawal of all foreign forces and the
                            establishment of some form of compromise coalition?</p>
                        <p>5. You should also use occasion to reaffirm the main lines of US policy
                            (cease fire, withdrawal of all foreign forces, efforts to conciliate the
                            factions and form a government of national unity) and say that the
                            administration intends to do whatever it can to see that an equitable
                            solution along the above lines eventually emerges. You should draw upon
                            the pertinent parts of the Secretary’s January 14 press conference<note

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JR_1">Journiac</persName>: I have just returned
                            from Kinshasa where I saw <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            and his Foreign Minister and discussed Angola. I found the diplomatic
                            situation favorable, with the moderate Africans prepared to face the
                            leftists. The situation could, however, be improved. For the Africans,
                            Angola is a white man’s affair which they look to the West to solve.
                            This present confidence in the West, however, will not last if the
                            military situation continues to deteriorate. Most of the moderate
                            African regimes are not ideologically motivated, and they tend to favor
                            the west because they see us as their traditional friends and as
                            stronger than the Communists. Whether this state of things will last
                            will depend on the military outcome. We believe the military collapse in
                            northern Angola thus far is not too significant because the Zaire Army
                            never was an effective fighting force. A relatively modest effort on our
                            part could re-establish the situation. If the [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] is still available, the necessary
                            operation could be mounted to retake some of the lost territory and
                            stabilize the situation. If, on the other hand, nothing is done, South
                            Africa will reduce its involvement. If we do act, South Africa will
                            maintain its presence. The question is whether you have the resources to
                            mount such an operation and on this score your people are
                            pessimistic.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Can it be done with available money, or is additional money
                            needed?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JR_1">Journiac</persName>: Our people say the
                            necessary money is presently not available. An account was to have been
                            opened, but nothing has happened.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: This is a national disgrace. The Cubans are able to send
                            10,000 men to Angola, and we are unable to even send money! The effects
                            of this will be negative for years to come. I will let you know at the
                            end of next week what the possibilities are.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JR_1">Journiac</persName>: I do not see any
                            alternative policy to the one I outlined. The Zairians are pessimistic
                            about the situation. What the US does in <pb n="428" facs="0467"
                                xml:id="pg_428"/>Angola will have an impact on African attitudes
                            throughout the continent. Not just in Zaire, but among our other friends
                            as well. The present US position is inconceivable to me, and I believe
                            that the African “fence-sitters” will assess the consequences of US
                            inaction and shift from our camp to the other one. In addition, it is
                            our real friends like Houphouet and <persName corresp="#p_SLS_1"
                                >Senghor</persName> who are threatened.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I agree with you completely. Where do things stand on your
                            helicopters?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JR_1">Journiac</persName>: We are working on that.
                            In addition, Zaire has asked us for propeller-driven aircraft,
                            Skyraiders and T–28s. These are obsolete models and we do not have
                            enough to respond to this request. You can help us with the Zaire
                            request, by turning some over to us for us to turn over to Zaire.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I will let you know by the end of next week what I think we
                            can do. The problem is that the fools in Congress have accused us of
                            involving the US in a “major secret war in Angola” and have produced
                            legislation prohibiting us from acting in Angola. I am due to testify
                            next week and expect the session to be violent and negative. As I said,
                            I will inform you late next week about the prospects.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_JR_1">Journiac</persName>: Let me thank you for
                            receiving me, and I convey the best wishes of my President.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Please convey to your President my high esteem and my
                            admiration for what he is doing in Angola.</p>

                            increase. The estimated total for several months was only about $180
                            million.</p>

                            again as much. What we are faced with, it seems to me, is whether to
                            shut off everything, or to continue with what is in the pipeline. The
                            President has not yet decided what to do about overt aid, so there’s no
                            need to address that now. Anyone feel that we should not continue with
                            what is in the pipeline?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: I have two questions.
                            I know I’m the new boy here, but I am concerned with what we are

                            that all this will run out in March and then we will be finished and the
                            whole thing will collapse. I have two questions. First, is this what we
                            want to do? Encourage <gloss target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> with every bit of what is in the
                            pipeline and then let them fade away and collapse? We might be injured
                            by letting that happen. Maybe we should approach this on different
                            grounds. Maybe we should explore other means to try to get a better
                            deal, try to buy better terms than ultimate complete surrender. These
                            are big questions. I don’t have the answers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: This paper does not
                            include all that we should do. The major question is whether we shut off
                            everything now, continue with what’s in the pipeline or use what we have
                            differently. Along with our review we must plan for consultation with
                            the major elements involved and the neighboring countries to ease
                            tension. It is not just to run the pipeline out. There are other
                            alternatives. If we were just quitting, we could shut the pipeline
                            now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: No, not shut it off
                            now, but put the dollars we have to some other and perhaps better use.
                            What is our money situation now? If the Defense supplemental passes it
                            will bar the use of any of the money in it for Angola, and will rule out
                            any reprogramming, right?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>: The President can try to
                            do something overtly, but we do not have a free hand.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: I understand that
                            there is [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] but do
                            we have to check with the Appropriations committees on this?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: Let me clarify our money
                            situation. We have been authorized $31.7 million. All of that has been
                            obligated except [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                            declassified</hi>]—or, more correctly, we can deobligate some and make
                            available a total of up to [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] There is [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: That’s [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: This might be available,
                            although we would have to go to the Appropriations committees and
                            explain what we wanted to use it for in Angola.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: And you think they’d
                            agree to using it for refugee aid, resettlement, etc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: They might—we don’t know.
                            They might not approve anything. The [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount
                                not declassified</hi>] we wanted from Defense reprogramming is out
                            totally. Our use of the 1976 Reserve replenishment would be subject to
                            Congressional approval.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: The sum of [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] is really all
                            that is readily available.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: The rest is all possible,
                            but not assured.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>: I agree with what you are
                            saying, <persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Bob (Ellsworth)</persName>. This
                            paper was not intended by my people as a final plan. We were just trying

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Disengagement could be
                            a bridge, but it seems to me that if we push things through the pipeline
                            and then come to an abrupt halt when the money runs out that we may not
                            be doing the best thing. I want to support a policy in the larger
                            concept about which we are all clear. Something better than outright
                            surrender. Something better for Zaire and for France than to encourage
                            them to go all out with us and then for us to pull out in March.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>: In all fairness,
                            there’s something missing here and State should supply it—policy. We

                            alternative would be to maintain a relatively high level of guerrilla
                            activity which will help lead to a political settlement. Or more on the

                            withdrawing, going into the woods, but holding territory while talking
                            with others. If we do this, how would the remaining dollars best be
                            spent, which will determine whether we should keep the pipeline open or
                            hold up. There is no decision from the Secretary yet, but this will give
                            us policy.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>: I don’t think that

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: We might have more

                            What is the threat to Zaire and <pb n="432" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_432"
                            />Zambia? So we would want to maintain whatever military capability we
                            could muster. We want to get the most value from our money.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>: Should we spend the
                            money for general operations to try to sustain UNITA/FNLA? What would
                            they do?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Who knows?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: We shouldn’t confuse what
                            we are talking about with the classic definition of guerrilla warfare. I
                            think the trend is to keep up general operations—to try to maintain
                            lines of communications. I think the most you could expect would be that
                            they would try to protect some of the land. <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> might split on a real guerrilla situation if you
                            tried to move them from the towns where they live and put them into the

                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>, too. He might move to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>: Especially if we tell

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: What happens when we
                            tell them we want to pull the plug.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>: Don’t. Let’s get the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: One of the key
                            elements is whether the President wants to take on the Congress again
                            and try to get overt aid for Zaire/Zambia or for Angola or what.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>: Whether he does or not,
                            what should he do with <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>—stretch
                            out our funds, or are we in a situation where we should go all out for

                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> likely to do?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: Probably try to hold on to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Any realistic hope
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> could control his

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: Maybe he could hold on for
                            a week. We can’t even get a lead on what he would do unless we can talk
                            to him about what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can do. If we tell him that
                            this is our plan, then we could talk to him about what he can do. This
                            is the same problem with <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>,
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> and <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>: If we go to him now we
                            could only ask him what he is going to do. If we wait and go with a
                            prepared U.S. strategy we could ask what he would do within that
                            framework.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: There’s not much time to
                            make decisions. He is hard pressed and is trying to save his troops.
                            Probably he would get away from the railroad and from the roads and just
                            try to exist.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: If we go and say we
                            have so many dollars, what’s the most optimistic estimate?</p>
                        <pb n="433" facs="0472" xml:id="pg_433"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: That he would hold on for
                            a week or so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: If we asked, he might
                            say he wanted what was in the pipeline.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: He might say he wanted
                            what he asked for last—mortars, ammunition, etc. But the situation has
                            changed and if he has to move, he might want land mines now to protect
                            his area. He might want aircraft to put supplies into a new area. We’d
                            have to look at that and decide if it was possible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: If he does that, are
                            we going to Zaire and ask them to help us out or just stick with what we
                            are doing?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: We need the political
                            strategy which will give us guidelines about what to do. We need a paper
                            and then to check with the President on further aid. Then we can get
                            what we are doing coordinated with the political strategy of the four or
                            five major actors. It is unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I think there is

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: No. He read about what

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: He doesn’t have a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: They are not going to
                            be ready to go for a month, so maybe it is not necessary to make an

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: That’s like being in the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: The French didn’t send the

                            intend to get into the game.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: It is one thing to train
                            how to fire missiles from a helicopter, but quite another to use a
                            helicopter in that manner.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Well, we don’t need to
                            decide this right now. Let’s see where it fits into the political

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: I have a related issue. I
                            believe we simply have not exploited the scope and degree of the Cuban
                            involvement. If they don’t get burned we are asking for trouble down the
                            road. They are going to raise hell in Latin America. We’ve got to find a
                            way to clip their wings.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: I couldn’t agree
                            more.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: And I think we would
                            have the support of many Latin American nations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Yes, they would agree, and
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, too. We have not yet gotten
                            all the mileage out of this in this country, either. If we had, we
                            wouldn’t have so many goofy things happening. We’ve got to find a way to
                            go all out on this.</p>

                        <opener><salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Yesterday in Paris I received the President of the Republic of Gabon. He
                            shared with me his thoughts as well as those of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBF_1">Houphouet-Boigny</persName> on the Angolan
                            matter. These two Presidents as well as Chiefs of State of other
                            moderate African countries are going to recognize within a very short
                            time, the People’s Republic of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>Our two countries have maintained close cooperation on their policies
                            with regard to Angola. We have, for our part, kept the commitments which
                            we undertook. But, on the whole, the actions which France and the United
                            States have taken have not been able to improve the situation, to my
                            regret, and we are forced to recognize that the People’s Republic of
                            Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>) is exercising control
                            over the major part of the territory in this country.</p>
                        <p>Our moderate African friends are troubled by this situation and are going
                            to recognize the new state very soon. It seems to me important that we
                            avoid their doing this in a dispersed fashion and separately from us. It
                            seems to me as well that France must not give the impression of refusing
                            to recognize the new state until the last moment and rather under the
                            pressure of events. This is why we propose to recognize the People’s
                            Republic of Angola (<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>) very soon. I
                            wanted to inform you of this personally before this decision is made
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Mr. President, the expression of my most friendly
                            thoughts.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: What about the South
                            Africans? What are they doing? I read that they had formed a buffer
                            line.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: That’s right. And they
                            still have some people in Serpa Pinto.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: What is the guerrilla
                            warfare capability of <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>?
                            What is the over-all assessment of his capabilities—training, equipment,
                            etc.?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: Well, he’s not done that
                            lately; he’s been fighting a conventional war. But he has demonstrated
                            an ability to maintain himself under guerrilla warfare conditions. The
                            big problem will be resupply. He has only one airfield now. There’s a
                            chance he might get some supplies via South Africa, but that’s not
                            certain.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: What was his record
                            against the Portuguese?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: Acceptable. He managed to
                            stay on inside Angola while the others fled.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Where?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJM_1">Potts</persName>: In the south, which is his
                            tribal region.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: He held on for six
                            years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: Of course the Portuguese
                            were not always making a big effort.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: After we got supplies
                            to Serpa Pinto what would he do with them—would he have the means to
                            move them? Are there roads?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: There are roads, and they
                            have trucks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: What position is South
                            Africa taking? Are we encouraging them to do more? They may be our only
                            hope. I was told the other day that there are more Cubans in
                            Angola—percentage of the population, that is—than there were Americans
                            in Vietnam at the peak. If the South Africans will stay we ought to help
                            them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: That’s what they’d
                            like—for us to help them with equipment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: We are talking to them,
                            but have offered no aid.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: They’ve asked for
                            enough equipment to choke a horse.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: We can’t touch it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: It wouldn’t go with
                            Congress, and if we went up there with it, it would only set fire to the
                            issue.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: What is left that we can
                            put in?</p>
                        <pb n="440" facs="0479" xml:id="pg_440"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: Well, with some
                            reprogramming we can free about [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: For how long?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: For as long as the money
                            lasts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: You mean that is in
                            the program that we were working on, but a lot of things have happened
                            since then. We would have to take a new look.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> wants demolition equipment now.
                            The South Africans were to have given him some, but they are being cosy
                            with him. They want him to turn over some <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> personnel—I guess so they can put them into jail—so
                            they are holding back in delivering aid. The big problem is what are we
                            going to do down the road? Where are we going? We can continue our
                            resupply. It looks as if <persName corresp="#p_RHA_1">Roberto</persName>
                            is about finished, but <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>
                            could use some. We could continue this resupply without going to the
                            Congress. This would enable <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName> to continue for a while, but it would have no
                            end in sight other than to just support him until we run out. How long
                            and for what purpose?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> told [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] that he expected Zaire to go
                            on?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: I would think he will hold
                            out for a while. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> is more
                            problematical.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> is more dependent upon access to
                            the railroad, and he is likely to be the first to negotiate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: That’s my feeling,
                            too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> will too, eventually.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: How long?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MEW_1">Mulcahy</persName>: A month or two. And once
                            he does he will play it straight. If he tried to operate in Luando
                            Province he would find it hostile territory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: The French have
                            indicated to us privately that they will move to recognize the <gloss

                            solve the helicopter problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: What about the
                            British?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: They told us about the
                            French, and they were candid about their not being able to stop them or
                            a European Community ground swell.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: As you know, Secretary

                            the area at the end of March or early April. He will try to sort out
                            where we stand with these countries. I’d like to suggest that the

                            and treat it as a day-to-day problem—what we do, where we go, etc.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: May we go ahead and

                                corresp="#p_ERF_1">Bob (Ellsworth)</persName>, you had some problem
                            with this before. I’m going with what the President said. We can present
                            a proposal to him for decision.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: I support <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>, but I’m not ready to approve
                            this until we have a plan and a policy. As I recall our last meeting,
                            State was going to come up with a policy paper and I would be pleased to
                            see that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: State has no paper. We
                            have one but it has yet to get the Secretary’s stamp. But let me tell
                            you what we have in mind, subject to the Secretary’s approval. We
                            visualize immediate steps so as to try to moderate the adverse impact of
                            this situation. And we are concerned particularly about Angola’s
                            neighbors. With Angola, we could proceed to dribble in aid. No one at
                            State feels we can go to the Congress and ask for anything more for
                            Angola. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> might get some
                            aid from South Africa, and maybe from the French, but if the French
                            recognize the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, they probably
                            won’t help any more. Our objective would be to try to redress the
                            adverse impact. Now a problem I see is can all this wait until after
                            Henry’s trip? I think that we can’t wait until then to go to the
                            Congress for aid for Angola’s neighbors.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Based on what you just
                            said, what are we doing helping <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2"
                                >Savimbi</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: I do agree that his

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Like what?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Some modest political
                            accommodation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: It would help Zaire rally.
                            I think it would be helping Zaire for us to continue to help <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: No question. No doubt
                            that Zaire at present wants us to help out with whatever we can do.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: What we are doing with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> is de facto
                            disengagement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: He wants to continue.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: That’s about the only case
                            you can make.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Okay. If that’s what
                            we are doing, then we must be prepared in a cold-blooded way to cut it
                            off when the money runs out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Well, we were talking

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: It may be—depending
                            upon how fast you spend what’s left.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: Well, there simply
                            should be no tears when the time comes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: We’d like permission to go
                            to the French and get the helicopters back. If they expect us to pay for
                            them, all we may get out of this is a bill if they lose one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>: Didn’t we make it clear
                            when we started this?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: No. I think we ought to go
                            to them and say that we are not able to pay any more bills.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Let’s presume that
                            they have no more bills.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: We need to clarify this.
                            It was not mentioned when we first made the arrangements.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Who has control?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: The French.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Why pay for them? We paid
                            for the delivery, didn’t we?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: Yes, and we’ll have to
                            pay to fly them back, too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Did the French pay?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: Who would pay for them if
                            they gave them to <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: We can’t.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWG_1">Hyland</persName>: That’s probably what we
                            ought to be doing, trying to turn over any equipment we have to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: I think you should
                            tell the French what our problem is, and get the helicopters back on
                            that basis. It is clear that we are not going to get any use out of
                            them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: I think we can handle this
                            without directly raising the issue, just review what we are responsible
                            for.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: If the French
                            recognize the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> soon, that ought to
                            make it easier to get them back.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJL_1">Sisco</persName>: One thing I want to make
                            clear, I hope that we are not going ahead on the assumption that the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NW_1">Nelson</persName>: We’ll go ahead on a modest

                            and I’m not sure we could get four planeloads in now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: There’s nothing cheap

                            a lot with that. I recall what we did with the Kurds.</p>

                        <p>1. I am extremely disturbed by <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Sauvagnargues</persName>’ letter indicating that French recognition

                            more at stake than many countries, wishes to keep in step with its
                            former African colonies, and feels vulnerable because it has been
                            involved with us in aiding the anti-<gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> forces in Angola. There is little point in wasting
                            political capital with a close ally if the effort seems pointless. But I
                            would hope that France might postpone its action for about a week until
                            at least we have thought through our own position and been able to
                            convey it to our friends in Africa and coordinate with our friends in

                        <p>2. In transmitting my letter below on an urgent basis, you should explore
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> the
                            possibility of postponing recognition in order to apply maximum pressure
                            on the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to make concessions to the
                            view point of half of Africa and much of Europe. You should stress with
                            him that, in our belief, there is an inherent contradiction between the
                            French Government’s proposed assertion to the <pb n="444" facs="0483"
                                xml:id="pg_444"/><gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> that it
                            attaches “le plus grand prix” to Soviet-Cuban withdrawal and its hasty,
                            unconditional recognition. You should also stress that his move destroys
                            the possibility for any meaningful approach to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> by the countries of Africa and the
                            world which are very prepared to see the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> lead an Angolan government but not as a Soviet-Cuban
                            satellite.</p>
                        <p>3. You may tell <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> that
                            we are in the process of refining a policy toward Angola designed to
                            bring maximum pressure to bear on the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> to make some concessions, using arguments of
                            persuasion as much as withholding recognition and cooperation. We need a
                            few days, however, to launch a new policy, which we believe will be much
                            more effective than any “sauve qui peut” policy of hasty recognition, at
                            least in limiting the damage inflicted on the Western position in Africa
                            and around the world by our evident loss of will to stand up to a
                            blatant Soviet-Cuban power play.</p>
                        <p>4. If it seems clear to you that there is no way to postpone recognition
                            in any meaningful fashion, then the main thrust of your “more in sorrow
                            . . .” remarks should be on the need for close consultation in the
                            future, and cooperation in bolstering the shaky position of our
                            remaining African friends.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Begin text:</hi> Dear Jean:</p>
                        <p>Your letter announcing France’s intention to recognize the Luanda regime
                            reached me at a time when Angolan circumstances have filled me with deep
                            concern and regret. I can only agree with you that we draw quite
                            different conclusions from rather similar analyses of the situation.</p>
                        <p>The instant response of your government to the military victories secured
                            on behalf of a minority regime by a Cuban expeditionary force,
                            encouraged and equipped by Moscow, will, I fear, only help to drive home
                            the lesson we have sought to avoid—that Communist intervention on behalf
                            of Marxist allies in conflicts in the developing world is a paying
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p>It has seemed to me that we could create a scenario, including aid to the
                            neighboring states of Zaire and Zambia, which would have allowed the
                            West to bargain its recognition and cooperation in exchange for concrete
                            concessions in the area of Soviet and Cuban withdrawal and the
                            establishment of some more representative government. But if we
                            recognize first, and then ask for concessions, we are in the weak
                            position of being a “demandeur” intervening in the internal affairs of a
                            state we already recognize. And, as you imply very correctly in your
                            letter, separate acts of recognition only serve to weaken the impact we
                            might hope to achieve with such recognition through a more coordinated
                            and hard-bargaining posture.</p>
                        <pb n="445" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_445"/>
                        <p>In our intense dialogue about Angola with many African leaders, some of
                            them very close to France, we have found a strong desire to do something
                            constructive to strengthen the forces opposed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, and to protect moderate states from
                            the sort of radical interference in their internal affairs exemplified
                            by Angola. I am afraid that your action will not seem responsive to
                            their concerns. But ultimately, of course, I recognize France must do
                            what it considers to be in its best long-term interest.</p>
                        <p>I can agree with you that continued insurgency will tend to prolong a
                            Soviet and Cuban presence in Angola. If you feel that French interests
                            require such rapid recognition then I can only urge you not to throw
                            away your influence by recognizing first—and then negotiating with empty
                            hands. Could you not at least probe to see what concrete assurances you
                            can elicit regarding the withdrawal of the Soviet-Cuban expeditionary
                            force and steps toward a government of national reconciliation?</p>
                        <p>I need hardly tell you that Western credibility has suffered grievously
                            as a result of US inability to come to the aid of moderate forces in
                            Angola, and general Western European reluctance to get involved. I would
                            like at least to thank France for having done more than any other
                            European country to prevent what we see now happening. It seems to me
                            that, if we are to contain the damage caused by what amounts to a
                            Western defeat, then we must make early and serious moves to provide
                            additional economic and military aid to the countries neighboring
                            Angola, who remain our friends for the time being and which have been
                            made so vulnerable by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            victory. We will still wish to discuss this containment aspect of our
                            Angolan policy with you.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, we are working out a policy which we believe will
                            provide us with more bargaining power in dealing with the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> than one of simple acquiescence in a
                            Soviet/Cuban victory. I would sincerely hope that your government might
                            find its way clear to postpone any final decision on recognition for
                            about a week, giving us time to consult with our friends and allies and
                            develop a more coherent regional containment strategy.</p>
                        <p>Whatever your final decision, thank you for allowing me the opportunity
                            to comment on your forthcoming decision. I hope that we can remain in
                            close touch on the Angolan question, even if our policies should now
                            diverge.</p>
                        <p>Nancy is better and joins me in sending warm regards. Henry. <hi

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> received me at noon
                            February 16 for review of Angola situation. I argued that it is
                            important that we not give up our trump of diplomatic recognition
                            precipitously before seeking to exercise maximum leverage on <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. At least we should wait a minimum
                            time to develop a joint approach to the problem of the Soviet-Cuban
                            presence. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> agreed
                            that our objective in Angola is the same—stimulate Africa’s natural
                            tendency to reject foreign domination. But <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Sauvagnargues</persName> disagreed with our analysis of how to do
                            it. Recognition of reality of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            victory, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> feels,
                            gives us opportunity to begin working with <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> to encourage their taking distance from Soviets.
                            Refusal to recognize only keeps the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> locked into Soviet-Cuban embrace. In addition,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> has already made
                            commitment to African moderates that France will recognize <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> so as not to leave Houphouet and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AA_1">Ahidjo</persName> among others all alone
                            and unsupported. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName>
                            agreed that while we disagree on recognition tactics, we must continue
                            coordinating our efforts to bolster Zambia and Zaire, to keep moderates
                            on our side, and to encourage African nationalism and moderation within
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. <hi rend="italic">End
                                summary.</hi></p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> began by reading
                            your letter (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). I followed
                            that up with the argument that we must maintain maximum pressure on
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> by holding back recognition
                            until we can prepare an appropriate program of containment for the
                            Angola area. By conceding recognition first, we weaken our position and
                            give the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> every incentive to
                            maintain their solidarity with the Cubans. If we withhold recognition,
                            we give the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> a reason to begin
                            separating themselves from the Cubans and Soviets, and give the moderate
                            Africans and Europeans time to work out a plan designed to weaken the
                            Soviet position.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> replied that the
                            situation is both delicate and complicated. Like the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, France is not anxious to recognize a
                            fait ac<pb n="447" facs="0486" xml:id="pg_447"/>compli in Angola. But
                            from that point, the French analysis differs from ours. The <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> victory is a reality. Western
                            options are limited. Support for a guerilla war is out of the question.
                            It would only prolong the fighting and deepen the Soviet involvement by
                            maintaining <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> dependence.
                            Essentially, we have a choice between recognizing the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> first and bargaining afterward, or
                            bargaining first and recognizing afterward. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Sauvagnargues</persName> said that if we attempt to bargain first,
                            we really do not have the leverage we think we do. We worked against the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> knows that we worked against them.
                            Our refusal to recognize the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> will
                            have absolutely no effect beyond driving them more deeply into Soviet
                            dependency.</p>
                        <p>3. Even more central than the previous arguments, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> emphasized, is the
                            position of the African moderates. Earlier, we asked the moderates to be
                            hard on the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, and they responded
                            positively. Now the Ivory Coast and Cameroon have recognized. Even
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> in a recent message that he
                            has no objection to France recognizing the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss>. All <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>
                            asks is a guarantee that the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> not
                            unleash the Katangese gendarmes. The African moderates supported us when
                            we needed them. We cannot let them down now. We must stay with them. In
                            fact, <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> wanted to announce
                            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> on Saturday,
                            but agreed to consult first with the US, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>. In effect,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> has made a
                            commitment to Houphouet to join in the recognition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> said
                            that if there is any chance that <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> and the moderates in the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> will distance themselves from the Soviets, it is
                            important that we start working to stimulate this natural African reflex
                            right away. This can only be done through recognition and communications
                            with the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> that it is
                            clear we agree on fundamental objectives. We just differ on the
                            potential effect of recognition. I suggested that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOF_1">GOF</gloss> take some time to reflect and allow us
                            time to come up with a broad plan of action that would protect our

                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> then argued that
                            the act of recognition is not all that significant. We must separate the
                            act of recognition from the real leverage we can exercise on the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> which will come from their need for
                            a Western economic presence. I countered by pointing out that quick
                            recognition will only give the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                            the feeling they can get what they want from the West without ejecting
                            the Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> argued
                            back that the use of recognition as a bargaining lever has never worked,
                            especially when the object of the exercise has just won a military
                            victory to come to power. When Angola was dis<pb n="448" facs="0487"

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> said, a prolonged
                            armed resistance was expected. This did not come about, and the issue of
                            recognition is no longer relevant. Moreover, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> has made a commitment to
                            Houphouet, and <gloss target="#t_GOF_1">GOF</gloss> recognition really
                            cannot wait. <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> said
                            he was impressed by the Brazilians who told him that the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> will quickly understand that Soviet
                            assistance is cumbersome, and will be looking for a way out through
                            contacts with the West.</p>
                        <p>7. In conclusion, I argued that the <gloss target="#t_GOF_1">GOF</gloss>
                            should give Washington at least a week’s leeway to develop a plan that
                            will help us pursue our common objective in Angola. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> said he would transmit
                            our request and arguments to <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1"
                                >Giscard</persName>, but did not feel that the President would
                            reverse his decision. He stressed, however, his complete agreement with
                            the need to develop a coordinated approach to an <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>-ruled Angola, especially the
                            requirement that Zambia and Zaire be bolstered both economically and
                            militarily.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I do not see much hope that <persName

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I appreciate your having provided me, in your message of February

                        <p>I understand the considerations which have led you to this decision, but
                            I do not believe that the attitudes of the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> are likely to be affected in any manner by the
                            rapidity with which we take steps to recognize it. The failure of
                            resistance in Angola in the face of massive Soviet and Cuban
                            intervention is a geopolitical fact which cannot be ignored. Therefore,
                            the United States intends to move slowly and with careful deliberation.
                            In the meantime, we shall do our best to rally both U.S. and world
                            public opinion against what is taking place in Angola.</p>
                        <p>Again, Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of your advance

                            from the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. You are to seek an appointment with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> as soon as possible and drawing
                            upon the following talking points, explain the Secretary’s position on
                            Angola and assistance to Zaire.</p>
                        <p>2. You are to inform him of (A) the firmness of U.S. policy, (B) our
                            determination to continue to work for the withdrawal of the Cuban
                            expeditionary force from Angola and the diminution of Soviet influence
                            there, (C) our current efforts to delay Western European recognition of
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, (D) our concurrent efforts
                            to alert our friends in the European Community to the urgent need of
                            Zambia and Zaire for economic and security assistance and (E) our policy
                            to do everything feasible to increase our own level of assistance to
                            Zaire in both the economic and security fields.</p>
                        <p>3. Talking points:</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> still believes that the
                            common policy we pursued in Angola these past several months in an
                            effort to bolster the majority liberation movements in Angola was
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>B. The U.S. shares with President <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> the bitter disappointment we know he feels at the
                            failure of our joint efforts.</p>
                        <p>C. We sincerely regret that, in the end, we could not provide the support
                            which we believe was needed. But we trust that many have learned from
                            this experience lessons that will not be lost in the future.</p>
                        <p>D. For our part we are determined to continue to oppose further
                            Soviet/Cuban intervention in Africa wherever it may occur.</p>
                        <p>E. Currently the U.S. is endeavoring to persuade its friends in the
                            European Community to withhold recognition of <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> in order not to appear to “reward” so readily this
                            minority government imposed on Angola by Cuban troops and Soviet arms.
                            Realizing that recognition by the European Community is inevitable,
                            however, we are asking Community members to link their recognition to
                            the withdrawal of the Cubans and the minimizing of Soviet influence and
                            to an <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> policy of
                            reconciliation.</p>
                        <pb n="451" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_451"/>
                        <p>F. In our approaches to the Europeans we have taken special pains to
                            alert Community members to the serious economic and security problems
                            faced now by Zaire and to urge that they provide all possible help to
                            Zaire as it confronts potential threats by the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                                >MPLA</gloss> regime in Angola. We are stressing with them the need
                            for building up the strength of the Zairian economy at home to enable
                            Zaire to withstand attempts to undermine its security.</p>
                        <p>G. The United States has no early plans for the recognition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> regime; on the contrary it is
                            prepared, in consultation with Angola’s neighbors, to continue to
                            provide whatever assistance it can to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1"
                                >UNITA</gloss> as long as it is able to maintain a credible
                            resistance to the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>H. We would greatly value at this juncture the President’s assessment of
                            how Zaire expects to pursue its connections with Angola in the short and
                                mid-term.<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">In telegram 1512 from

                        <p>1. You are instructed to seek a meeting with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> at the earliest possible time.
                            You should make the following points:</p>
                        <p>—The United States not only shares with Zambia disappointment over the
                            outcome in Angola but also wishes to express to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> our appreciation for the concern
                            we know he feels over the prospect of an unfriendly Soviet-supported
                            government on his western frontier.</p>
                        <p>—The US remains firm in its policy to exert every possible effort toward
                            the withdrawal of the Cuban expeditionary force and the minimizing of
                            Soviet influence in Angola. It wishes to work with all other concerned
                            governments to this end.</p>
                        <p>—In recent days we have taken steps to communicate to all members of the
                            European Community our concern for the future stability of central and
                            southern Africa because of the existence in Angola of a sizable Cuban
                            expeditionary force and a large and potentially troublesome Soviet and
                            Soviet-bloc presence.</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is anxious to have President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>’s assessment of the
                            nature of Zambia’s short-term relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> regime. Does the President believe
                            Zambia will feel it necessary to extend recognition to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> government? If so, what would be the
                            timing?</p>
                        <p>—If and when Zambia recognizes the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1"
                            >MPLA</gloss>, what will be Zambia’s attitude toward <gloss
                                target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>? Will it actively help <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> continue his guerrilla
                            operations? Will it allow <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> to
                            use Zambian territory as a sanctuary?</p>
                        <p>—The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> still has resources that it can
                            make available to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss>, in the full
                            realization that the continuance of such aid will be increasingly
                            difficult as the weeks pass.</p>
                        <p>—We are asking our European friends to consider seriously at their
                            forthcoming meetings the urgent need for assistance to the economies and
                            to the security of both Zaire and Zambia.</p>
                        <p>—Officers in Washington benefited greatly from recent talks with Messrs.
                            Kuwani and Walusiku in gaining an appreciation of the scope of the
                            economic problems which confront Zambia. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> is concerned with the time factor in the light of the
                            urgency and magnitude of Zambia’s needs as well as the pressing need to
                            present requests for US assistance in the next few weeks to the Congress
                            which is about to begin consideration of next year’s foreign assistance
                            budget. We would appreciate any impetus President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> can give to his government in
                            formulating the requests it is likely to make of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. Senators <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CR_1"
                                >Clark</persName> feel encouraged about the chances of success our
                            aid requests on behalf of Zambia are likely to have in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>—We trust the President realizes that the US is not in a position to meet
                            all the possible needs of Zambia, but it wishes to play an appro<pb
                                n="453" facs="0492" xml:id="pg_453"/>priate part. Therefore, we
                            would welcome information on present Zambian assessment of reactions of
                            others (including <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> and other governments) to Zambian
                            approach. We also hope that Zambia will take steps as early as possible
                            to coordinate donor activities and contribution to avoid duplication and
                            to insure that each donor is called upon for the sort of aid that it can
                            provide best. We will continue to encourage other donors and to apprise
                            them of our perception of Zambia’s needs.<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If the Tunney

                            most moral—to a degree not rivaled by anyone in history, but to tell me
                            that the U.S. would declare in a bill of lading that we were delivering
                            arms to Zaire! Now really! What are we going to do when we really want
                            to ship arms to Zaire? And this is something that could come up in six
                            months or so. If we allow something like this to stop us then we are
                            going to have a monumental <pb n="457" facs="0496" xml:id="pg_457"
                            />problem. What can we tell Zaire—that we have these arms but we can’t
                            deliver them? Now are you trying to tell me that we can’t deliver
                            arms?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: There are really two
                            points here. First, if you are talking about using <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> aircraft to deliver arms to Zaire for
                            Angola, then because of the Tunney Amendment the answer is “no”. Two, if
                            you are asking could <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> charter an
                            aircraft and deliver the arms, the answer is a qualified “no.” They
                            propose to give them the money and let them go out and purchase arms
                            from wherever they can—Spain or somewhere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But how will <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> get the arms there? If the
                            great, powerful U.S. can’t deliver them, how can we expect <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName> to do it?</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">name not declassified</hi>]: They could go to an arms
                            broker.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think that this
                            negative approach might have an adverse impact on Zaire. I just can’t
                            accept that we are cowed by a small African nation like Liberia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ERF_1">Ellsworth</persName>: If we got the arms
                            over to Zaire, would <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> put
                            them on into Angola?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Probably not.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That would depend a
                            lot on what we told Zaire. It depends upon the general situation. Are we
                            trying to stop further erosion? I can understand writing off Angola, but
                            not Zaire and Zambia. We’ve got to do what we can to reassure them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>: Does <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName> need arms?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>: He needs money to buy arms
                            and food.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SBC_1">Scowcroft</persName>: He’d probably prefer
                            dollars to a shipment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName>: He wants dollars, but he
                            also wants ammunition and arms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If he gets money he
                            still has the problem of getting arms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RDH_1">Rumsfeld</persName>: It depends on what he
                            wants money for.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Whether Zaire
                            transships depends on what we tell <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> to a considerable extent. Zaire means something
                            to us. I don’t necessarily favor shipping arms to Angola, I think we’ve
                            had it with Angola, but I am concerned about <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName> and what we do with him. We
                            need to boost his morale. We must not permit things to slide any more in

                        <p>SUBJECT</p>
                        <p>Termination of the Angolan Covert Action Program—Key Briefings, Decisions
                            and Status of Funds</p>
                        <p>1. The total funds approved for the Angolan Covert Action Program are
                            $31,700,000. The final increment of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] was approved by two consecutive 40 Committee
                            Meetings—14 and 21 November 1975—by the President on 28 November 1975
                            and released by the Office of Management and Budget on 4 December 1975.
                            The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Comptroller allotted the
                            additional [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] to
                            the <gloss target="#t_DDO_1">DDO</gloss> on 10 December 1975.</p>
                        <p>2. Nine days later when the Tunney Amendment to the Defense
                            Appropriations Act of 1976 was passed by the Senate on 19 December 1975,
                            a total of an estimated [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] had been committed to specific planned purposes
                            leaving an estimated balance of uncommitted funds (or funds for which no
                            specific planned use had been as yet decided) of [<hi rend="italic"
                                >dollar amount not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>3. By 27 January 1976, the date the House concurred in the Senate
                            Amendment, the estimated total of the committed funds was [<hi
                                rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] leaving an
                            estimated balance of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] as uncommitted or not designated for a specific
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>4. On 9 February 1976, the President signed the Defense Appropriations
                            Act for 1976 (Public Law 94–212) into law. The total committed funds
                            (computed as of 3 February for the 40 Committee meeting of that date)
                            were still [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>]
                            leaving an estimated balance of [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>5. Subsequently, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was directed to
                            propose a course of action to the Operations Advisory Group, which was
                            designed to terminate the operation with a minimum amount of human
                            suffering.</p>
                        <p>6. This included cancelling all airlift of ordnance in the pipeline from
                            the United States, terminating all third country national recruitment,
                            cancelling plans under consideration for improved communications,
                            discontinuing all requisitions for military equipment, and terminating
                            all other planned logistical support facilities.</p>
                        <p>7. These funds have been redesignated to provide terminal financial
                            support to <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_FNLA_1">FNLA</gloss> to include for example purchase of
                            food, clothing, shelter and resettlement of their adherents. None of
                            this involved further supply of U.S. arms to Angola. The funds required
                            for direct termination purposes, total $3,849,964. This reformulation
                            resulted in identifying [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not
                                declassified</hi>] for return to the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> Reserve Fund.</p>

                        <p>8. The <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> General Counsel and the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> Comptroller found the proposed

                        <p>2. According to Soviets, <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> authorities

                            following:</p>

                                >SAG</gloss> are impossible as long as <gloss target="#t_SAG_1"

                        <p>B. Hydroelectric power station on the Cunene River is the property of the
                            people of Angola and it has no intention whatsoever of destroying

                        <p>D. The Government of the People’s Republic of Angola respects <gloss

                            22 of the Senate and House Defense and Appropriations Subcommittees, we
                            may shortly face renewed accusations of continuing a “covert war in

                            for the loss last week of an Air Zaire F–27 aircraft destroyed on the
                            airstrip of Gago Coutinho in southern Angola where the plane was
                            unloading food for <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> forces. A
                            Cuban-piloted MIG–21 caused the damage. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> lawyers were concerned about reimbursing Zaire without
                            first discussing it with the Congress since there had been no previous
                            agreement that money could be spent for damaged aircraft. <gloss

                                >Bush</persName> decided in consultation with the lawyers that
                            Congress should be consulted, and he is said to have received clearance
                            for Congressional consultation from the White House.</p>
                        <p>Only in the case of Congressman <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1"

                            reportedly go beyond the narrow question of reimbursing Air Zaire. It
                            would appear that <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> followed
                            up on the March 22 briefing and asked Director <persName

                            so, met with <persName corresp="#p_NW_1">William Nelson</persName> on
                            March 23. <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName>, flanked by
                            staff members Snodgrass and Preston, accused <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> of being “a law unto itself” and of failing to respect
                            the intent of Congress to cease all further contributions to the Angolan
                            war. Having been told in January that only [<hi rend="italic">dollar

                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> was in fact in the final phase
                            of its operations. In response to his detailed questioning, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> was made privy to virtually all
                            of the details regarding the disengagement program approved at the March
                            12 meeting of the Operations Advisory Group,<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d182">Document 182</ref>.</note> including the
                            fact that [<hi rend="italic">dollar amount not declassified</hi>] are to

                            forces. Mahon gave every indication of being furious and threatened to
                                <pb n="466" facs="0505" xml:id="pg_466"/>take the issue to the
                            public. He agreed not to do so until at least next week when Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> has been requested to
                            appear before the full Defense Subcommittee. A time for the meeting has
                            not yet been set pending the return of <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1"
                                >Bush</persName> to Washington on Friday, March 26, when he must
                            decide how to handle <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName>’s
                            challenge.</p>
                        <p>It seems to us we could, and should have avoided consulting with Congress
                            on this reimbursement question. It is difficult to imagine that the
                            details of this phasing out operation will not become public property,
                            particularly if <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> appears
                            before the full Defense Subcommittee. Not only has the Agency but also
                            the Administration left itself open to renewed sharp public criticism
                            and heightened suspicions regarding our clandestine support for
                            insurgency in Angola. Renewed debate in Congress risks complicating
                            approval of increased economic and military assistance for Zaire and
                            Zambia. Publicity will also embarrass <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1"
                                >Mobutu</persName> in his efforts to normalize relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>. And, finally, even if our
                            legal case is impeccable, as our lawyers have at least assured us, the
                            political reality of <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName>’s
                            reaction would make it very unwise for <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> to proceed to disburse the [<hi rend="italic">dollar
                                amount not declassified</hi>] either directly or indirectly to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Even if <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> and his aides could
                            be persuaded to keep what they know to themselves, it seems likely that
                            some members of the other three oversight committees will ask themselves
                            what the Air Zaire plane was doing in southern Angola. The argument that
                            we are merely providing <gloss target="#t_UNITA_1">UNITA</gloss> with
                            food and the possibility of resettlement will cut little ice, if
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName>’s reaction is any
                            criterion.</p>
                        <p>The only hope we have, and it is a slim one, is to have <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGHW_1">Bush</persName> persuade <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGH_1">Mahon</persName> that the Agency is indeed
                            phasing out its final operations in Angola and a full subcommittee
                            hearing could affect US national interests adversely.</p>

                        <p>A MIG–21 rocket attack destroyed an Air Zaire Fokker-27 at Gago Coutinho,

                            be currently in the area of Sessa.</p>
                        <p>The Zambian Government has released a previously impounded <gloss

                        <p>There are reports of pockets of guerrilla activity throughout Angola.

                        <p>One thousand five hundred (1,500) Cuban troops arrived in February
                            bringing their presence to 13,500. Flights from Cuba continued every

                        <p>An undetermined number of Cubans are serving in Mozambique as military
                            advisors; there is, however, no evidence of Cuban combat troops. The

                            assembling MIGs in Mozambique. Rhodesian air and group raids against
                            guerrilla camps in Mozambique might lead Mozambique to request Cuban
                            troops to aid in air defense, including both anti-aircraft weapons and
                            fighter aircraft.</p>

                            were being transferred from Angola to Somalia. (Efforts are being made

                                resettle themselves and their followers”). The total cost for

                            ANGOLA</p>
                        <p>As you know, this is a matter that I stepped into while it was in
                            mid-stream. I mention this only to explain that since I had no personal
                            knowledge of this covert action program as it originally developed, it
                            was necessary for me to be briefed on it and the developments leading up
                            to the enactment of the Tunney amendment after I was nominated to the
                            position of Director. We have, of course, taken some steps since I took
                            office, and I have been assured that the steps which we have taken
                            during my tenure were proper and not inconsistent with the Tunney
                            amendment or any other provision of law.</p>
                        <p>I think we are all generally familiar with the thrust of the Tunney
                            amendment, Mr. Chairman, but let me read the exact language since we are
                            being held to a strict interpretation of precisely what the Tunney
                            amendment stated or implied. As enacted, the amendment states:</p>
                        <p>“$205,600,000, none of which, nor any other funds appropriated in this
                            Act may be used for any activities involving Angola other than
                            intelligence gathering . . .”</p>
                        <p>I think it is clear from this wording that this amendment applies only to
                            funds appropriated under the Defense Appropriation Act for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1976, the bill to which it was a floor
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>Let me point out that eight Committees of Congress, including this
                            Subcommittee, were briefed (in accordance with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_HTL_1">Hughes</persName>/Ryan amendment to the Foreign
                            Assistance Act), on the President’s Finding with regard to Angola and
                            the fact that the Agency had committed funds in furtherance of that
                            authority and determination. It was stated in those briefings that the
                            funds involved included $31.7 million from the Agency Reserve which had
                            been approved for expenditure in furtherance of that Presidential
                            determination. Those funds were taken from the Reserve account prior to
                            the enactment of the Tunney amendment and therefore certainly were not
                            funds appropriated under the Department of Defense Appropriation for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1976.</p>
                        <pb n="473" facs="0512" xml:id="pg_473"/>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, I have reviewed the House and Senate debate on the
                            Tunney amendment and there were numerous references in that debate to
                            the fact that funds had already been committed, including the $31.7
                            million, to that program. I think it is clear from that debate that the
                            issue was whether any <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> funds should be
                            expended for that program. You will recall, it had been proposed that
                                [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>] for future
                            activities in Angola and this was a central issue in the debate on the
                            Tunney amendment. It became clear that the Congress wished to terminate
                            the program without those additional funds being reprogrammed and spent,
                            and, of course, that reprogramming action was never taken. However, I am
                            not aware of any suggestion, in the discussions in the floor debate or
                            in Director <persName corresp="#p_CWE_1">Colby</persName>’s meeting with
                            this Subcommittee on the 22nd of January of this year that enactment of
                            the Tunney amendment would require withdrawal of any of the $31.7
                            million. In fact, I believe those discussions made it clear that the
                            $31.7 million had been committed or designated for that program.</p>
                        <p>As I believe you know, we have spent no funds beyond the $31.7 million
                            that was under discussion at that time. In fact, we were able to divert
                            some of those funds from military support, for which they had originally
                            been designated, to pay for necessary expenses involved in the
                            termination of our covert action program. It is our opinion that our
                            actions have been within the letter and spirit of the Tunney amendment,
                            and I have been so advised by my General Counsel all along the way. As a
                            matter of fact, in diverting some of these funds from the purposes for
                            which they had been committed or designated, we have not only used them
                            for terminating the program in Angola, [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>We will be happy to review with the Subcommittee the precise expenditures
                            which have been made and committed from that $31.7 million, but my
                            greatest concern in this whole matter is the question of our credibility
                            with this Subcommittee. I don’t want any dispute or misunderstanding
                            between me and our oversight committees if it is humanly possible to
                            avoid it. I regret that such a situation has developed and I want to
                            resolve it as quickly as possible. We have issued instructions that no
                            further expenditures are to be made pending a determination on the
                            matter with the Subcommittee. As you know your Investigations Staff is
                            reviewing this issue and our Reserve account generally. I am anxious to
                            know their findings. We will do everything we can to facilitate that
                            review.</p>

                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> given the continued presence of
                            Cuban troops there. We could, of course, give an affirmative vote while
                            at the same time calling for the departure of the Cubans. While this is
                            a theoretically feasible option, it would represent such a sharp
                            departure from our present posture that I strongly recommend against its
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Veto the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>
                                application</hi></p>
                        <p>A veto would dramatically emphasize our position of non-recognition of
                            the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and would be consistent with
                            our posture toward Cuban presence. Our act could be accompanied by a
                            statement that the continuing presence of Cuban forces makes Angola less
                            than <pb n="475" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_475"/>independent, thus
                            underscoring our opposition to that presence. A veto, however, would be
                            heavily criticized in the Council and in Africa, and would be considered
                            inconsistent with the positive achievements of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s recent trip to

                            up the Cuban role in Angola, it would highlight that all members of the
                            Security Council except the United States are willing to accord <gloss

                        <p>An abstention would be consistent with our position of non-recognition of

                            with the statement that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> made in Monrovia with regard to Angola: “We
                            are willing in principle to open discussion with the Angolan authorities
                            with a view toward normalizing our relations and seeking means of
                            cooperating—including on economic development. We wish Angola well as a
                            unified and independent state. But before we can go far down that road,
                            we want to know Angola’s intention with respect to the presence of
                            foreign forces on its soil.” An abstention would probably avoid a bitter
                            debate which a veto could provoke and in which the Cubans and Soviets
                            could gain propaganda advantage. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWW_1"
                                >Scranton</persName> could be instructed to make a tough statement
                            pointing out our continuing non-recognition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> and our insistence on the Cuban
                            withdrawal from Angola. An abstention, however, could be criticized as
                            being inconsistent with our strong position on Cuban presence in Angola.
                            We could be accused of shifting from pressing for military measures
                            against the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss> to allowing them to
                            enter the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, without any change in the
                            objective situation. The current estimate is that the only company we
                            might find in an abstention would be the Chinese communists, although
                            they have reportedly told the French <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Mission they have “no problems” with the application.</p>

                        <p>Message from President <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Angola is very interested in having relations with the United States.
                            They should be of the same character as relations with other countries,
                            i.e. be normal and be built on respect for each other’s national
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>2. Angola is no satellite to the Soviet Union. Angola has a cooperation
                            with Cuba which is motivated by the state of war within the country. The
                            Angolan Government is firmly resolved not to be subjected to foreign
                            influence of any kind.</p>
                        <p>3. The Cuban presence has no aggressive intention; there are no ulterior
                            motives. Angola needs the Cuban help, particularly in the areas of
                            technical assistance and military training. The Angolan army must learn
                            to use advanced weapons. The enemy has this knowledge and the border
                            areas near Zaire and Zambia are still very sensitive. In the area of
                            health the Cubans are making tremendous efforts to help. The language
                            similarities make it possible to help quickly and effectively. When the
                            Portuguese left Angola there were only 69 Angolan doctors.</p>
                        <p>4. Cuba’s presence is not directed against US interests. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> wants to give the US
                            Government his guarantee that the Cuban presence is solely motivated by
                            Angola’s wish to strengthen its national independence.</p>
                        <p>5. Angola has a great interest in becoming a member of the United
                            Nations. Unnecessary delay will cause irritation among the Angolan
                            people and within the <gloss target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="478" facs="0517" xml:id="pg_478"/>
                        <p>6. There is a great future for the bilateral relations between Angola and
                            the United States.</p>

                            some positive elements, and may provide an opening to further
                            discussions. We would appreciate it if the enclosed statement could be
                            transmitted directly to President <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> by secure means.</p>
                        <p>3. Meanwhile, we will be watching closely to see whether Angola reduces
                            substantially the number of foreign troops stationed on its soil and
                            whether Angola is prepared to play a constructive role during the
                            current delicate phase of our negotiations to bring majority rule and
                            independence to Namibia and Zimbabwe by peaceful means. In this
                            connection I note <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>’s

                            cooperation in pursuit of both of these objectives is both helpful and

                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Begin separate text to the Angolans:</hi> The United
                            States Government has read with interest the remarks of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> and shares his expressed
                            desire to improve the relations between our two countries. American
                            officials have repeatedly stated that the US has no quarrel with the
                            Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, and we have sought to
                            make this clear through our actions on certain commercial matters over
                            the past six months. We maintain good and cooperative relations with
                            many states whose ideology is different from ours.</p>
                        <p>6. Our concern since before independence has been that Angola should
                            emerge as an independent, sovereign state which would be spared
                            convulsions of civil warfare. We believed that only through some form of
                            national reconciliation between the liberation movements could
                            independence and peace emerge. The unfortunate history of Angola since
                            independence speaks for itself.</p>
                        <p>7. We think that it is in the interests of both our countries to promote
                            stability and peace in central and southern Africa. The presence of
                            large numbers of foreign military personnel in Angola does not
                            contribute to this goal.</p>
                        <p>8. The United States for its part wishes to make clear that it is neither
                            encouraging nor supporting dissidents within Angola.</p>
                        <p>9. The US can appreciate Angola’s interest in entering the United Nations
                            this fall. We hope, in turn, that President <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName> can comprehend our concern over the continued
                            presence in his country of a large army of a non-African power, which is
                            notable for its hostility to the US and its apparent belief that the
                            road to progress lies through armed confrontation rather than dialogue.
                            Our position on Angola’s future admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> will be considered in the context of the continued
                            withdrawal of Cuban forces and Angola’s attitude toward ongoing efforts
                            to promote a peaceful transition to genuine majority rule in southern
                                Africa.<note n="4" xml:id="d191fn4">Voting against U.N. admission
                                June 23, the United States emphasized the presence of Cuban troops
                                in support of the People’s Republic of Angola. When the issue came
                                before the Security Council on November 22, the vote was 13 in
                                favor, none against, with the United States abstaining. The General
                                Assembly voted to admit the People’s Republic of Angola to
                                membership in the United Nations December 1. (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>10. In this regard, we have been encouraged by the recent indications
                            given to US officials by the Angolan Representative to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> that the Cuban forces would confine
                            their activities within the boundaries <pb n="480" facs="0519"
                                xml:id="pg_480"/>of Angola itself. A policy of non-intervention in
                            the affairs of neighboring territories will contribute to the goal we
                            all seek of a peaceful transition to majority rule in southern Africa.
                            Angola is in a position to play constructive role in the delicate
                            process evolving in southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>11. The US Government would welcome President <persName corresp="#p_NA_1"
                                >Neto</persName>’s views about how we could best develop our
                            contacts in a constructive way and about the situation in southern
                            Africa. We look forward to the time when we can have amicable relations

                            calling you the past few days. You have been in my thoughts too,
                            particularly since Tuesday’s surprise.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">On

                            every possible success in the leadership sweepstakes. As you might
                            imagine, I have very ambivalent feelings about the possibility of your

                            have his report by now, including my agreement to associating us in

                        <p>I find myself basically in agreement with your analysis of the rest of

                            the pressure on you at home. Frankly, I think we diverge only slightly
                            in the tactical area. If I have been a bit hesitant regarding your
                            initiatives, for example, on Rhodesia, it is only because I think we
                            must not let continued Cuban presence serve as a form of blackmail which
                            stampedes us into hasty moves. Such action could be perceived by our
                            moderate African friends (and others around the world) as being a direct
                            result of Angola and the continued Cuban presence, which could <pb

                            Although there are indications of success on the latter, I am not as
                            optimistic from your reports about the possibilities for a settlement in
                            Rhodesia. Let’s do keep in close touch on all this.</p>
                        <p>I am planning, by the way, a wider European tour in May in connection

                            see the British Foreign Secretary across the table in Oslo, I look
                            forward very much to a talk with you in London, in either capacity. I
                            also wanted you to know that I have accepted Christoph Bertram’s

                            Message to the Secretary on Southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>1. Following is summary of long message from Foreign Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> to the Secretary on southern
                            Africa, received via British Embassy March 15:<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d193fn2">The letter from <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                    >Callaghan</persName> is attached but not printed.</note></p>
                        <pb n="483" facs="0522" xml:id="pg_483"/>
                        <p>2. The Foreign Secretary restated his belief that indigenous influences
                            would operate to reduce the internal consequences for Angola of
                            Soviet/Cuban intervention. This in no way meant that he did not feel as
                            strongly as we did about the wider effects of Soviet/Cuban intervention.
                            Although the success of their intervention in Angola may encourage them
                            elsewhere in southern Africa, <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> thought that given the differing circumstances
                            elsewhere, there was not necessarily any immediate danger of such
                            adventurism. The principal worry, however, is that African perceptions
                            of any efforts we might make that appear to prop up <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> or South Africa would be
                            colored by the black/white aspect of the problem to the complete
                            exclusion in the Africans’ view of any concern with Communist
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>3. The task then is to preempt the possibility of further Communist
                            involvement so that the problem is never faced. The three danger areas
                            are Angola, Rhodesia, and Namibia. In Angola, the continued presence of
                            South African troops and the ensuing possibility of action in the
                            Security Council against South Africa could leave <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> in the position of having to go along
                            with a resolution calling for South African withdrawal. The important
                            step is to remove the cause of the possible actions by pressing for
                            complete South African withdrawal, and <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> to this end is making it clear to <gloss
                                target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> that it would not have their support
                            in the <gloss target="#t_SC_1">SC</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_HMG_1"
                                >HMG</gloss> is also joining its EC partners in a forceful démarche
                            to the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> concerning withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>4. On Rhodesia, <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> was told in recent
                            discussions with Mozambique’s FonMin <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1"
                                >Chissano</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            believed the point was past where majority rule could be attained
                            through negotiations. While accepting material and technical aid from
                            the Communists for the guerillas, <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1"
                                >Chissano</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            would not permit the presence of foreign troops unless there was foreign
                            intervention on Smith’s side. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> thought this line of <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> thinking should be encouraged and mentioned <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>’s interest-free loan on pounds five
                            million to help offset sanctions losses in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Even though the odds are turning against it and Smith seems as cagey as
                            before, <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> thought it more
                            important than ever that something be done to reach a settlement based
                            on early majority rule. <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss> has made
                            clear to Smith that there is no possibility of British support for him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> is considering the
                            options available for further <gloss target="#t_HMG_1">HMG</gloss>
                            involvement in the search for a settlement. The four Presidents<note

                                <persName corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName>, the Foreign Secretary
                            told him he would be willing to visit <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> (their chairman) if he and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BR_1">Banda</persName> thought it worthwhile, to try and
                            devise a package of <pb n="484" facs="0523" xml:id="pg_484"/>proposals
                            based on early majority rule. To date, no reply had been received from
                            either.</p>
                        <p>5. Namibia is the third danger area. Even if South Africa is persuaded to
                            withdraw its troops from Angola, the larger problem of Namibia itself
                            remains. In <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>’s view, the
                            essential thing is to get the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> to
                            accept that the transfer of power to the Namibians must come sooner
                            rather than later—in his opinion, in six months rather than the three to
                            four years the <gloss target="#t_SAG_1">SAG</gloss> seems to be thinking
                            of.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> mentioned our recent

                                >HMG</gloss> had decided to give an additional pounds five million
                            to Zambia and pounds one million to Zaire. He also said <gloss

                        <p>7. The Foreign Secretary took the occasion to point out that <gloss

                            the traditional European position in Angola and serve to offset
                            Communist influences.</p>

                            to have this opportunity to meet you, because there are not many people
                            in this part of the world who can philosophically shape events. It is
                            easy to deal with the practical immediate issues. But without a
                            philosophical grasp, you only solve the immediate issues.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Fine.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m at your disposal.
                            But before you give me the benefit of your view, there are two things I
                            want to mention.</p>
                        <p>You have seen reports of my motives for coming here—to set up an
                            American-sponsored liberation movement, or to support the white
                            Rhodesian regime. With respect to the latter, I am prepared to put the
                            power of the United States behind the liberation of Rhodesia, in
                            unmistakeable terms, so Smith and <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> cannot possibly misunderstand. Second, we do not
                            want to see blocs in Africa. The Soviet Union and the United States
                            should not seek blocs in Africa because if we do it, Africa will be the
                            battleground of foreign conflicts.</p>
                        <p>I don’t like to come on goodwill trips, but I like to see results. I am
                            willing to admit the mistakes of the past. We have had Vietnam, the
                            Middle East, Watergate; it was not possible to do everything
                            simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>But I am here now to do something.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East, many Arab countries were extremely suspicious of U.S.
                            motives until ’73, when President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> saw that in confrontation with the United States,
                            it was not possible to do anything, and in cooperation with the United
                            States much was possible. Now we’re giving $1 billion to Egypt in aid
                            and he has got more territory back than any other Arab leader.</p>
                        <p>I like to think we can do the same with Africa on a cooperative basis,
                            and work with you. This is not to say you can’t work with others. You
                            have your own national interests.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Mr. Secretary, we are
                            very, very grateful to have this opportunity to meet with you. We will
                            meet again tonight and I will have an opportunity to say it formally
                            with my friends. We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss with
                            you privately our problems.</p>
                        <p>We have problems. Liberation on the continent. You are celebrating your
                            200th year; we are in the process of liberation. We are celebrating our
                            14th year—Tanzania and Zanzibar. It will be 15 years in October. So
                            really the continent is in the process of liberation.</p>
                        <p>The problem is classical colonialism as in Rhodesia, or with our friend
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>, racialism. It is
                            our big headache. We live with it. We try to solve it. We can’t do it
                            without the assistance or at least the under<pb n="486" facs="0525"
                                xml:id="pg_486"/>standing of the big powers. And for a continent
                            like Africa, liberation isn’t enough; we need economic development. I
                            think we in Tanzania are really the Fourth World when they put us into
                            categories!</p>
                        <p>We have sometimes our problems; sometimes the problems of work, and for a
                            country like Tanzania, it is sometimes very difficult for us to achieve
                            independence. And we need and we value the help and at least the
                            understanding of the great powers. So we really value this
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What help do you have
                            in mind?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: In Southern Africa. We
                            will explain our view. Things are changing. What was needed in ’75 might
                            not be needed now. We want pressure on the regime in Rhodesia; we want
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> regarding
                            Namibia, and ultimately for change in South Africa. We can’t live with
                            South Africa as it is.</p>
                        <p>As to what you can do, sometimes the things we ask are extravagant for
                            you within the limits of the old system. You might not be able to give
                            us arms, but what can you give us? We hope you will answer that
                            question, within the limits not of your power, but of your system.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are certainly
                            prepared to give the understanding, and we are prepared to do more than
                            this, to see what help can be given. It is my purpose to establish
                            contact with leaders like yourself so we can see it more naturally. I
                            don’t know the nuances. We have to see it from the point of view of the
                            Soviet Union; you have to see it in terms of independent Africa. But I’m
                            here to learn. We believe that without majority rule, there can’t be
                            peace and independent African development. Other countries can certainly
                            participate. Leaders like you know how to use the big powers for your
                            needs. But in cases like Angola where foreign armies actually appear, it
                            is a problem for us. But our aim should be to prevent situations like
                            that from arising.</p>
                        <p>The regime in Rhodesia can’t survive if we all behave with unity and
                            dedication. And Namibia too. Certainly, the problem of South Africa is
                            harder.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: This has always been my
                            view. Southern Africa has always been a whole—Portugal, South Africa—but
                            we can’t tackle the whole problem together. We can define it all
                            together—as we tried in 1969 in the Lusaka Manifesto.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d194fn2">See <ref target="#d9">Document 9</ref>.</note> We
                            were accused of being racialists in reverse; we were accused of wanting
                            violence for the sake of violence. Fighting had already started in
                            Angola.</p>
                        <p>So we had to define what it is we are trying to do—a group of countries
                            of whom my country was a part. We didn’t make a distinction. We gave
                            South Africa the fact that it was an independent state—but we didn’t
                            make a distinc<pb n="487" facs="0526" xml:id="pg_487"/>tion between
                            Namibia and the others.</p>
                        <p>Our priorities are Rhodesia and Namibia. South Africa is harder. The
                            cases of Rhodesia and Namibia are clearer. You and the Soviet Union and
                            China really all agree the South Africans should not be there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: So there is this clarity
                            at least in those cases. Those are the priorities, and in any case,
                            South Africa is harder. I am not sure personally that Africa has given
                            itself much thinking. Africa understands the colonial issue; but it has
                            not fully understood the problem of South Africa and fully thought about
                            how to solve it.</p>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> gives independence
                            to the Transkei and we have [Paramount Chief] Matanzima coming to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to seek membership, there will be
                            confusion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If Transkei becomes
                            independent, what would be the balance in Southern Africa? The blacks
                            still would be the majority.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Yes. But if we accept it,
                            we would be accepting that the solution is partition, not majority
                            rule.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have not decided
                            yet with respect to the Transkei. The present inclination is against
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Some say it is not the
                            same as Rhodesia, but it is. Smith may say to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: “You fortunately declared
                            your independence in 1905, and we did it in 1965. It is an accident that
                            your independence is recognized and ours isn’t.” Maybe he hasn’t said
                            it. But I’m sure Smith at least thinks of saying this to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing that South Africa is a tougher nut to crack, we would still
                            be saying the objective in South Africa, as in Rhodesia, is majority
                            rule.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I plan to say this in

                        <p>I read in some African papers that I need this trip—for domestic reasons.
                            That is not true. I am being attacked by the conservatives. We have to
                            do what is right.</p>

                        <p>We are coming out of it. But we have these two right-wing candidates. But
                            they will lose. What I can do is state certain principles that will
                            develop their own momentum, and implement certain policies that will
                            develop their own momentum.</p>
                        <p>You know revolutionary movements better than I do. But to me it has
                            always seemed partly a psychological problem—at some point the minority
                            gives up. Next Tuesday,<note n="4" xml:id="d194fn4">April 27.</note>
                            Smith will have no way to believe we will help. As long as no
                            non-African countries get involved. But you and your colleagues have

                            people—the President or whoever. They wouldn’t have to say they are
                            there to meet me.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I’m not sure I can get
                            their President, but I’m sure I can get their senior people. You have
                            mentioned three things, which are very important.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ll have given the
                            speech.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Right. But these three
                            things you said: The minority regimes can’t expect support from the US.
                            You have already said that. Second, that the US is not trying to build
                            its own “leadership group.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: That is very
                            important.</p>
                        <p>Quite frankly, for us and Zambia and Mozambique, this is the new fear.
                            Not so much that you will support the white regimes, but that you <pb
                                n="489" facs="0528" xml:id="pg_489"/>are trying to build up
                            something of your own—I said this to the British—to say “it’s ours.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> even met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> personally. We knew what the
                            African reaction would be. We knew what South Africa wanted—a friendly
                            buffer if a settlement is achieved. We knew this, but we wanted majority
                            rule. The objectives weren’t the same but we wanted majority rule. But
                            it failed because Smith isn’t ready. Now we support the liberation
                            fighters. But we are the same people. Don’t think now we are enemies of
                            the British. I said this to the British.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What I would
                            appreciate from you, Mr. President. I may not understand everything that
                            happens, or everything that you are told by others. So if anything
                            happens that you have a question about—we will set up a channel. The
                            sort of thing this <hi rend="italic">Observer</hi> correspondent says is
                            childish [See Tab A].<note n="5" xml:id="d194fn5">Tab A is not
                                attached.</note> We have no interest in backing one group against
                            others, or against you, and we won’t do this.</p>
                        <p>In Angola we got into a situation where, quite frankly, it seemed to us
                            that the Soviet Union . . . If the Soviet Union had given the freedom
                            fighters support, we would have done nothing. But when it came to
                            massive equipment and outside forces, we had to view it as big power
                            bases. I had the impression you weren’t happy. You don’t have to
                            answer.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Oh, I’ll answer. We don’t
                            want the big powers in Africa, entrenching themselves. When one does,
                            the other will.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Inevitably.</p>
                        <p>On Southern Africa, we will be influenced heavily by your thinking. We
                            will have to do it one step at a time. First, Rhodesia, then Namibia,
                            and only then can we take on South Africa. We need their help on
                            Rhodesia, and their toleration in Namibia. But in my speech I’ll say we
                            look to the end of discrimination in South Africa at a definite
                            date—even in South Africa.</p>
                        <p>You were summing up your three points.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Second was the United

                            look like my speech is yielding to you. It’s better if it’s our free
                            decision.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: First class. I
                            understand.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can say you’re
                            satisfied, or you’re hopeful, or whatever.</p>
                        <p>What about Mozambique?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: We helped build Frelimo.
                            It was us and China.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And you noticed we
                            never opposed it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Our relations are very
                            friendly. We don’t have the same system as they do. We didn’t fight a
                            guerrilla war. We agitated a little—it was very British. [Laughter] They
                            don’t fully understand what’s happening in Mozambique.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Nor do I.
                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: But we get on very well
                            with them. They very much respect the Chinese for building Frelimo.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We respect the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: But you see we disagreed
                            with the Chinese on Angola. The Chinese Ambassador was sitting right
                            here. I said we have to disagree. It is very painful for friendly
                            countries to disagree. We differed with Zambia too. It was very
                            painful.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, we agreed
                            more with Zambia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Yes, you agreed with my
                            friends more than I did! Can we still remain very friendly, even if we
                            disagree? We disagreed with Zambia and the Chinese, but we move on.</p>
                        <p>You spoke of my friend <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>.
                            Their system isn’t ours.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You said you’d send a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I’ll send a message, and
                            the message might be actually your statement in Lusaka. I’ll say they
                            should send someone—the Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It should be a

                        <p>Since Samora sent it to me, I call it “Samora.” [Laughter] I always say:
                            “Bring me Samora.” [Laughter]</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: How did it get started? I
                            used to go to the United Nations as a petitioner. This country was a
                            trust territory under the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>,
                            administered by the British. Twice I came to the United Nations. On one
                            trip I met Dr. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1">Mondlane</persName>. He had
                            been teaching in the United States, but was then working for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>. And we discussed liberation. I said:
                            “Why don’t you come to Dar es Salaam, instead of working for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and work for the liberation of your
                            country?”</p>
                        <p>So he came in 1962. There were several organizations. [The President’s
                            colleagues recite a number of names]. <persName corresp="#p_ME_1"
                                >Mondlane</persName> helped put them together into a front for the
                            liberation of Mozambique—<gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss>.
                            It was really a coalition of small parties. They started with agitation.
                            That was all we knew, from our experience. They tried it, but it wasn’t
                            enough. Then they started fighting—a year after the formation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But where did
                                <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName> come from?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName> was one of the freedom fighters.
                            When they came together, Machel was there. He was a hospital assistant—a
                            dispenser. He escaped and came here and was recruited and came into the
                            Army, and became the leader of the armed force. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_ME_1">Mondlane</persName> was assassinated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Oh, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ME_1">Mondlane</persName> was assassinated?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: He was assassinated here.
                            The same thing happened with Cabral.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you have any idea
                            who did it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: It was planned by the
                            Portuguese, with infiltrators.</p>
                        <p>When he was assassinated, they came together to find a new leader. They
                            were divided, as the politicians now fighting in Rhodesia. But at the
                            Congress, the fighters came, so they chose <persName corresp="#p_MS_2"
                                >Machel</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Senator <persName

                            impressed.</p>
                        <p>I’m seeing <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> in Lusaka, just
                            to show the symbolism of meeting with someone from the Liberation
                            Movement. I tried to meet the Bishop.<note n="8" xml:id="d194fn8"

                        <pb n="493" facs="0532" xml:id="pg_493"/>
                        <p>I’d be delighted to meet him, or <persName corresp="#p_SN_1"
                                >Sithole</persName>. We’re not interested in pitting one faction
                            against another.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: We have the same

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Bishop is in the

                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe he’ll recruit me
                            into his movement. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: That will be the first
                            sign that your statement was acceptable. Or he’ll reprimand you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What sometimes happens
                            is people meet me privately for a very friendly conversation and then
                            reprimand me publicly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Not only me!?
                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Latin America, one
                            leader told me very privately he was very concerned about Cuba. Then the
                            next day he said the opposite on television.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: They’re very democratic
                            in that hemisphere. They have to say different things in public and in
                            private. Here we’re not so democratic. We say the same thing publicly as
                            we say privately. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Actually, <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has it easier
                            than <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not really. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> has a problem this year, but
                            he’ll win. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1">Brezhnev</persName> has 15
                            colleagues he has to worry about, and maneuver. [Laughter] <persName

                            doesn’t know what he’s saying, but he says it effectively.
                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName>: He could be a very good

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So he’ll just read his
                            instructions. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Any Ambassador who wants to get even finds a cable—they’re all signed by
                            me—that they leak to the press.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Sometimes I read in the

                            message.” I don’t remember sending any message!</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KIM_1">Kaduma</persName>: At least
                            you have confidence in us. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: There is nothing that I
                            do that isn’t in the newspapers.</p>
                        <p>Now you will have dinner with the Foreign Minister. He’ll make a speech
                            at you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will it be very

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Tomorrow we’ll watch a

                            your President,<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">See <ref target="#d103"
                                    >Document 103</ref>.</note> I said that southern Africa was at a
                            turning point and that the situation was very worrisome <pb n="495"
                                facs="0534" xml:id="pg_495"/>indeed. We have been operating as a
                            team cooperating on two common programs, and I will explain in more
                            detail in our enlarged meeting. I will confine myself here to what I see
                            of the solutions your Government might wish to participate in.</p>
                        <p>As far as Rhodesia is concerned, we don’t see any solution to the problem
                            as long as Smith is there. His record shows that we have to get
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> involved because he
                            is Smith’s colonial master in the area, but still the only solution is
                            for Smith to get out. But how do we do this? We don’t know, but we have
                            to work together to find a way. We have to fight and the African
                            countries are backing the liberation groups to the hilt. Smith depends
                            very much on the white settlers, and we would like to believe that the
                            Western Governments can support moves to erode that support. If the
                            British, French, West Germans and others would help to underwrite the
                            certain financial losses that some of the settlers might suffer, this
                            would accomplish an outflow of the settlers if they would then see they
                            could go to places like Australia to begin a new life. We would also
                            like to believe that the United States could pressure <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> to be more cooperative now
                            that Mozambique has closed its borders. South Africa is the key to
                            Rhodesia. I know that your Government fears Russian and Cuban
                            interference in Rhodesia, but I also know of no African leader who has
                            spoken of this possibility. We do not want to see outside interference
                            at all, and we would not like to see outside support for factions in
                            Rhodesia. They should be left alone; that is the only way to avoid an
                            Angolan situation in Rhodesia. Once the United States Government
                            understands the problem clearly I see no chance of outside
                            interference.</p>
                        <p>On Namibia our stand is clear, and the role the U.S. should play is most
                            important. In defying the United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> is saying that Namibia is his. We do not want
                            Bantustans in Namibia but one government, nor do we want to see
                            interference from the outside there, but the delays in independence make
                            that possible. The role you can play is to put pressure on South Africa
                            to respect the decision of the United Nations. Your influence on South
                            Africa is important, and you could use it to make <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> see sense. If he does not,
                            there will be fighting and dying.</p>
                        <p>South Africa itself is an independent African state which is not a
                            colonial power, and we accept that fact. We do not, however, accept
                            apartheid, and we support those who are struggling to change apartheid.
                            Once again, the United States has a great deal to do with changing the
                            situation in South Africa. South Africa exists because of western
                            commerce and investment.</p>
                        <p>Whether in Rhodesia, Namibia or South Africa, African leaders have never
                            said they were chasing away anybody. We are all Africans, and the whites
                            in South Africa have their own right to live in their own <pb n="496"
                                facs="0535" xml:id="pg_496"/>country. But the issue of southern
                            Africa is a question of life and death. For you, Mr. Secretary, the
                            question for your decision is what you want to do to make life more
                            meaningful for all. Your decision to come here shows that you want to
                            find solutions to the southern African problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Thank you for your
                            kind remarks. The warmth and friendship that you and your delegation
                            have shown me has meant a great deal to me. You are admired in my
                            country for your courage and wisdom. We remember well your remarks in
                            Washington on the principles of equality and your call on us to live up
                            to these principles.</p>
                        <p>We have come through a difficult period in the United States, but we have
                            made our decision. I don’t make ceremonial visits, and I am here to
                            develop a program. A few years ago it was said that we have no Middle
                            East program, but events belie that statement. While it is true that
                            within the United States there will be resistance to my speech today, we
                            have made our decision. We are totally behind majority rule, and we will
                            work with the four presidents. You appreciate, of course, that we cannot
                            make public statements calling for armed struggle. In any case, I hope
                            you agree that any struggle must end in negotiation.</p>
                        <p>We will use our economic and diplomatic pressures on Rhodesia. My
                                speech<note n="3" xml:id="d195fn3">See <ref target="#d194fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 194</ref>.</note> appeals to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> to bring an end to apartheid
                            and set a timetable for the independence of Namibia. I hope that African
                            leaders will find an opportunity to emphasize the positive in our
                            position so that we will not be caught in a crossfire of criticism.</p>
                        <p>As for Zambia, we respect you as one of the intellectual and political
                            leaders, and we appreciate the cooperation we have received in certain
                            matters. We want to assist in your development, and after I return to
                            Washington we will look at new programs of assistance to Zambia.</p>
                        <p>If foreign intervention is kept out of southern Africa, the United States
                            can give you its maximum support. I appreciate your idea of the need to
                            help the settlers find new homes, and we are prepared to assist
                            economically in such a program. It is important for the four presidents
                            to refer to minority rights and for any constitution to protect those
                            rights. This will not keep many settlers from leaving, but it is
                            important for us psychologically. We have told the British, by the way,
                            that we will cooperate in any resettlement effort. There is no longer
                            any ambiguity. We support you.</p>
                        <p>We see it as a practical matter. The first problem to tackle is Rhodesia,
                            then Namibia and lastly South Africa. We need South Africa’s help in
                            solving the other two problems, although I have stated in <pb n="497"
                                facs="0536" xml:id="pg_497"/>my speech that apartheid must end. Of
                            course, we have no problems with you or your Government, Mr.
                            President.</p>
                        <p>We are prepared to have normal relations with Mozambique, and I hope to
                            see a representative of that country in Nairobi. There is no organized
                            hostility against Mozambique in the United States, although some see it
                            as a Soviet satellite.</p>
                        <p>Let me thank you once again, Mr. President, for receiving me and my
                            delegation and for your warm hospitality.</p>

                        <p>On South-West Africa, I have suggested to the Prime Minister that the

                            impression is this was a proposition the Prime Minister did not

                            the possibility of a later meeting this summer. There will have to be

                        <p>It will be helpful if we come to some conclusion on South-West Africa
                            before the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> debate. If we can reach
                            some conclusions which are reasonable, we can do our utmost to avoid a

                        <p>Is that a fair statement, Mr. Prime Minister?</p>

                            melancholy conclusion about what’s likely to happen. But that’s not our

                            they are now. The issue is international realities which have to be
                            faced. It’s an unwinnable situation: somewhere along the line it will be
                            lost. The question is not to lose it under pressure.</p>

                            the French, instead of having Zaire. It’s a series of historical

                            the German press whether I raised my views of South Africa. I’ll say
                            what I said to you: I may do it in three different forms, but I won’t go
                            further. I’ll be asked if we discussed Rhodesia; I’ll say yes. I’ll be
                            asked if we discussed South-West Africa and I’ll say yes. I’ll be asked
                            if we discussed South Africa and I’ll say yes.</p>

                        <p>May I say, Mr. Secretary, my colleagues and I are sincerely grateful for
                            these discussions, and we trust that good will come out of it, for
                            southern Africa and for the West.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Prime Minister, we
                            appreciate the openness of these discussions, and we too hope it will be
                            of benefit to southern Africa and the world.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: We hope it will not be
                            another thirty years before we meet again.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we succeed, there
                            will be a need for another meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: Because at 90 I won’t be
                            able to attend a conference. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But you’ll still be
                            the Prime Minister. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: God forbid.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll just say it
                            orally, not issue a statement. I’ll just say to the press that I can’t
                            go into detail. I will say I’ll send <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"

                            and a few of the others. Because I don’t want to do it in cables.
                            Because if we’re going to bring it off we’ll have to do it fast and with
                            discipline. Especially with this <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: As I’ve said many times,

                            your auspices or other auspices, I’m perfectly prepared.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It may be useful at

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: And the same applies to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Once we put the
                            package together, we have to talk to them in great detail. But in the

                            The trouble I have with this paper is I wish I could tear it apart and
                            prove how superior . . . Basically it’s what we have in mind. I have a
                            few practical points.</p>
                        <p>You seem to think Smith has to be replaced first, before negotiations. My
                            view is the longer he stays in place before things start unraveling,
                            until the blacks are organized, the better it is. Things could
                            unravel.</p>
                        <p>My impression is <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> would go
                            to Smith first and to David Smith only if it didn’t work. If this were
                            essential to your plan . . . But I don’t think it is.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Let’s go through the
                            timetable to see how the procedures are.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s do that.
                            Paragraph 13.</p>
                        <pb n="504" facs="0543" xml:id="pg_504"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Paragraph 14, really,
                            first. These are things we’ve got to decide ourselves over the next 3–4
                            weeks. First, we must agree on elements of a program and do some joint
                            planning so it’s not unilateral.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Then we’ll need broader
                            ministerial authorization. The Cabinet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can it be kept secret
                            in London?</p>
                        <p>Duff: At this stage, and with ministers if it’s a small group.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You seem to think this
                            program requires $1.5 billion over a 20–25 year period. £1.3 billion.
                            South Africa’s estimate is $1.3 billion. But I would assume it will last
                            over 25 years. There may be a stampede.</p>
                        <p>Duff: It may be irregularly phased, with peaks and troughs.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The larger the
                            appropriation in any one year, the bigger the domestic problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: There should be joint
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>Duff: We should get, in the next few days, the State Department, and some
                            economists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The man who is the
                            most ingenious at this is <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1"
                                >Robinson</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: I’m afraid he won’t have
                            the time to do it. Rogers will be back by the end of the week.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All right, Rogers. But
                            he’ll be very ingenious at coming up with financing schemes.</p>
                        <p>So, we authorize joint planning. We’ll give Rogers the responsibility but
                            see what <persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName> can come up
                            with.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Then, who else do we
                            talk to?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ve discussed it
                            generally with the Germans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We have too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are more willing

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: That is my impression
                            exactly. Then the Germans and French.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not until our plan is
                            ready.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: That’s what I wondered.
                            We have this European Council, and Jim and I could pull Schmidt and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: No. The Prime Minister
                            will do it. That’s number two.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So the British and we
                            will work out an inducement scheme, and they will talk to the Germans
                            and French.</p>
                        <p>I’ve promised to keep the South Africans informed. I’ll tell them a
                            little less than we’ve told the French and Germans—that we’re working
                            out an inducement scheme but it’s not ready yet.</p>
                        <pb n="505" facs="0544" xml:id="pg_505"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: When do we actually
                            unfold the scheme to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>?
                            Hopefully the end of July.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We can encourage them in
                            the meantime, but at the end of July you—in other words, an
                            American—would go to them and unfold the plan and hold him to the pledge
                            he gave you.</p>
                        <p>Duff: I’m told they have an Ambassador here . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He was present at all
                            the meetings.</p>
                        <p>Duff: So you could give your encouragement through him. The bigger scheme
                            . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are eager to get
                            me to go to South Africa. I’m willing to do it if they can assure me
                            he’ll accept. I won’t go there for a failure.</p>
                        <p>Duff: I heard that <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> didn’t
                            want to associate the next step in Namibia with your meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With the meeting in
                            Germany. On the next phase they do want to associate us. We do, as you
                            say, have to move with speed. Because the Soviets, <persName

                            will all have an incentive to destroy it.</p>
                        <p>Tony, should you and I do something jointly in putting a package together
                            to the blacks? I don’t want to be the one who deals with the whites
                            while you deal with the blacks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: That suits me fine!
                            [Laughter] It seems to me that talking to the blacks should be
                            immediately after putting it to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is something to
                            be said for doing it simultaneously. To go to the blacks first, then to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>, then to the
                            Africans again.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are just telling

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My idea is as close to
                            simultaneous as possible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: That is a point of
                            disagreement. We were considering approaching the blacks and <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> at the end of July, but not
                            have it completed until the end of September.</p>
                        <p>Duff: Tactics depend on how to approach the white Rhodesians. Our concept
                            was that it would be only the incoming Rhodesian government that would
                            get the goodies.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have to rely on what
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> told me. He felt
                            confident he could sell it to <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName>. And if it didn’t work he was sure he could get
                            David Smith to do it. I don’t have the sense that <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> is one who talks idly.</p>
                        <p>Duff: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be easier
                            domestically for us with Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: It would be easier for
                            us the other way.</p>
                        <p>Duff: The key is what will work best with the Europeans in Rhodesia. It
                            used to be the wisdom that only <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName> could do it. Lately, we’ve changed. The problem is
                            that anything associated with Ian Smith will stink in African
                            nostrils.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: The British weren’t sure
                            David Smith had the stomach for it.</p>
                        <p>Duff: Could our two services get together to work on it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To get information, or
                            to undermine Smith?</p>
                        <p>Duff: Both. I’m not sure we want to undermine Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If turmoil begins in
                            Rhodesia while we are putting this together, the black Africans will
                            have no incentive to settle it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: A new government will
                            come in only if there has been a change in opinion, which this package
                            is precisely designed to bring about.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why would it hurt
                            domestically if <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> turned
                            it over to you?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Our party will note that
                            the financial inducements going to a small group of whites are more than
                            to the rest of the world. There is deep mistrust and hatred of
                            Smith.</p>
                        <pb n="507" facs="0546" xml:id="pg_507"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It will be hard to
                            convince black Africa that Smith means it. No question about it.</p>
                        <p>Duff: Once the constitutional principles are agreed on and we come in,
                            the governor will form a mixed government in a transition period to
                            majority rule. Will <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> be
                            in it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no. Smith won’t be
                            in it. The only difference is the nuance of whether the agreement by
                            which he is replaced is signed by him or by someone else. If it is
                            someone else, it would look like a coup.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: The appearance of a coup
                            will have enormous advantages in Britain—and would change the political
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Smith is an obstacle
                            but is also a bargaining chip. If they think he’s hard to dislodge, they
                            have an incentive to agree. If he’s replaced by someone who has no
                            stomach for fighting, they may decide to keep the war going.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: It’s the problem of
                            deciding the fate of a country which one knows bugger all about.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. We’ll see. Maybe
                            when I see <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> he’ll say it
                            can’t be done with Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: The psychology of the white
                            Rhodesians is important.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In a way I’m a
                            prisoner of <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s judgment.
                            He says he’ll get <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> to
                            accept it and if not he’ll get David Smith to. With David Smith we will
                            need even more speed [to keep it from unraveling].</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We can decide these two
                            options at a later time.</p>
                        <p>At the moment, white Rhodesian opinion has no idea these inducements are
                            being offered. But the government is to be changed before these are
                            offered.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I personally think
                            getting an agreement signed is more important than who signs it. Because
                            in either case, he leaves. So the question is whether in order to get an
                            agreement, we have to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In which case, we will
                            need more time. It may be we have no option, and what you have here is
                            the only way to go.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I see the point. But it
                            may be the other way around. The next stage is the Prime Minister of
                            Rhodesia—Smith or whoever—goes to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nkomo</persName> and says, “I accept the terms I rejected last year
                            on that—whatever the name of that bridge.”<note n="5" xml:id="d197fn5">A

                                positioned to allow the Rhodesians to negotiate in Rhodesia and the

                        <p>Duff: But can he be trusted?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why do we care? If he
                            accepts all the terms. Once the agreement is signed, a new government is
                            constituted. It is that government which organizes the elections, not
                            Smith. To be plausible, it will be headed by a black.</p>
                        <p>Duff: But the agreement should lay out the principles on which majority
                            rule will be done—majority rule within two years, entrenched rights.
                            Would there be an intermediate stage, where Smith says he recognizes
                            what has to be done and urges his fellows to accept and then
                            resigns?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think it’s very
                            important to keep the threat of Smith’s resistance to get this done.
                            It’s the prospect of a five-year guerrilla war.</p>

                        <p>Duff: £50–60 million a year over 20 years. It depends on how much in fact
                            one has to pay out in pensions. For the people who stay, the Rhodesians
                            can pay the pensions. I think £2,000 million total.</p>

                        <p>If you can give us your best estimate of how that curve will run.</p>
                        <p>Duff: We don’t have to tie it to requests. We could limit it per

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: But wouldn’t it be

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: Then it is geared to certain

                            might contribute, certainly if resettlement became a problem. Certainly
                            at that point. Whether they would contribute to the initial fund, I

                        <p>Duff: Probably call it a different conference. I agreed with <persName

                        <p>Duff: We have an official in Windhoek who has been trying to soften them
                            up there. He’s in fact talking to <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName> today in Lusaka.</p>

                        <p>Duff: He reports cautious interest among the ethnic groups in Namibia.
                            There is one thing that does bother us—that this same official was told
                            that the South Africans are working on a statement for use in the <gloss

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. But I don’t
                            think <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> has told too many
                            of his people. Of course, Namibia and Rhodesia don’t have to be done

                            debate.</p>
                        <p>Duff: Probably you are right, sir. The South African Foreign Ministry
                            doesn’t know all that is in their Prime Minister’s mind.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On Namibia, I have

                        <p>Duff: Yes. This is where we got a number of different

                            well. So we discussed it only briefly. Perhaps because he wanted to talk
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1">Sauvagnargues</persName> first, or
                            because he wanted to discuss it without <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                                >Sauvagnargues</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President and <persName corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> had a
                            breakfast, and when the President raised it he pointedly steered it
                            away. We have not gone into it with the French in such detail.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has asked
                            that I pass on to you the following report of his meeting with Prime

                                received the report in a telegram from London, August 5. (Ibid., Box

                        <p>“I had a breakfast and meeting Thursday with <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> for almost two-and-a-half hours at Number Ten
                            Downing Street. We talked mainly about Southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> told me he praises you
                            to every American who comes through London, and he expressed confidence
                            you would win. He was confident also about his own domestic economic
                            situation. He will announce tomorrow that Britain has cut its inflation
                            down to 12.8 per cent (roughly in half). I told him his new economic
                            program was a courageous decision. He felt that with this program, with
                            the unions’ continued cooperation, and with the on-schedule development
                            of North Sea oil, they would be on their feet.</p>
                        <p>“We then turned to Rhodesia. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> thought we were up against heavy odds; Britain
                            had been living with the problem for over ten years. But he was ready to
                            cooperate. America’s active involvement and South Africa’s cooperation
                            were two big new factors on the positive side. He repeated the British
                            fear that <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> was a hard
                            man to crack, and quite skilled in maneuvering and evasion. I said that
                            for this reason we all had to move fast. <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>“We then worked out the following scenario:</p>
                        <p>—First, we will complete work on the economic package that U.S. and
                            British experts have been putting together, the guarantees to induce the
                            whites to stay in a majority-ruled Rhodesia. This should be finished
                            early next week.</p>
                        <pb n="512" facs="0551" xml:id="pg_512"/>
                        <p>—Secondly, the British will draft necessary legislation to assert British
                            authority over Rhodesia. The South Africans regard some transitional
                            period and some British presence as essential. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> is fearful of a formal
                            British authority that implicitly commits him to use British troops if
                            necessary to back it up; he is, however, willing to have Parliament
                            confer legal authority on a council of interested parties in Rhodesia to
                            negotiate the way to independence and majority rule, with a civilian
                            British presence to monitor the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>—Third, we will draft documents which will secure African, South African
                            and international agreement to the new political arrangements.</p>
                        <p>—When these are complete, which should be in about two weeks, I will send
                            Bill Rogers and <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Bill Schaufele</persName>
                            to give <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> a general idea and obtain their
                            overall agreement. The British will send a team of their own to Africa
                            with the same purpose, shortly afterward.</p>
                        <p>—With the Black Africans lined up, I will take it to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> early in September. With his
                            approval, we will then proceed to put the arrangements into effect
                            rapidly with the Black Africans.</p>
                        <p>“We reached general agreement also on Namibia, i.e., to move the
                            Constitutional Conference from Windhoek to Geneva, invite <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, and give a terminal date for
                            independence. The British, having no responsibility, would like to move
                            faster. But this is the maximum <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> will take now. The British have agreed to keep
                            at least silent on their preferences.</p>
                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> and I agreed our two
                            countries would proceed jointly on these issues from here on.”</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Two things. You
                            expressed some doubts about meeting in Europe.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: That’s correct, sir.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me express my
                            view. I agree with you the thing won’t be settled unless I talked to the
                            top people there. But it also won’t get settled if the blacks think they
                            can drive me crazy. If I go to Africa and go to Pretoria first, then
                            they’ve got me, because—if it fails—they’ll have me in the position of
                            having put myself at the mercy of the racist <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>. That’s what they’ll say. If I
                            meet you elsewhere, and then go to black Africa, and then Pretoria—that
                            way it is in the course of negotiations. And if it’s going to fail, I
                            can send <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>. You will
                            have put forward a good proposal.</p>
                        <p>As for where to meet. Maybe Switzerland, Berne. Geneva. Geneva doesn’t
                            have particularly good meeting places.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Zurich is very nice.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Some mountains.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The Matterhorn!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s a little high.
                            [Laughter.] Maybe Rio.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know what the Brazilians would think.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The climate is always warm
                            there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is winter. It
                            would be pleasant. It’s a little frivolous for Afrikaners.
                            [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Mr. Secretary, I think my
                            Prime Minister was a bit upset. The ball is starting to roll. He is
                            worried about the time. He thought you could go directly to the
                            Africans.</p>
                        <pb n="514" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_514"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t exclude it; it
                            depends on whether they are accommodating to Bill. If they say, “For
                            God’s sakes, let’s do it.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: That’s all the Prime
                            Minister wanted to know.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But it puts you at a
                            disadvantage. If they make demands you can’t meet, you are put in the
                            position of breaking up the negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: We wonder whether you are
                            putting too much stock in what the black Africans are saying. It’s a lot
                            of bluff with these fellows usually.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Just don’t lose your
                            cool. I can’t understand nervous Afrikaners. The meaner you are, the

                            to the British anything. It’s been done [answer conveyed to the
                            British], but in words that we have to study it first.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. Here [Tab B] is
                            the paper we are thinking of. They [the British] have the idea the white
                            minority should have a veto over constitutional changes. We shouldn’t
                            get so precise when we are in exploratory negotiations. We won’t show
                            this to the blacks, because they will start bargaining from it. I can’t
                            exclude that the British won’t. Bill will be instructed to say that if
                            there is a discrepancy between what the British say and what we say,
                            ours is governing.</p>

                            than we do.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: As for the possibility of

                            the answer is yes, we have leverage but it is a two-edged sword. If we

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF THE RHODESIAN PLAN</p>
                        <p>—The plan which has been developed for Rhodesia spells out a
                            comprehensive strategy to bring an end to the crisis and lead that
                            country to majority rule. It provides political and economic incentives
                            to the European minority sufficiently persuasive to encourage that
                            minority to stay in post-majority rule Rhodesia. The plan aims at
                            establishing under the most propitious conditions a moderate black
                            African government. It sets forth those steps necessary to launch an
                            independent Rhodesia on a course of political stability and economic
                            progress, thereby removing the causes of Soviet intervention.</p>
                        <p>—Although, in the interest of flexibility, some points of detail remain
                            to be worked out, the plan proceeds from the participation of and a
                            commitment to its success by the British government, the strong and
                            determined backing of the United States, most reasonable prospects for
                            generous international support in developed countries and the
                            understanding and likely acceptance of those of black Africa’s leaders
                            most directly involved as well as Rhodesia’s moderate nationalist
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>—In addition to the promise of independence under majority rule, the plan
                            provides Rhodesia’s black population a real economic stake in the future
                            and spells out mechanisms for bringing development assistance to
                            Rhodesia, which would be directed into ways most likely to rapidly
                            improve black incomes. The plan addresses those conditions which are
                            most likely to encourage Rhodesia’s white minority to stay. In this
                            regard:</p>
                        <p>(a) The plan addresses compensation for those who may wish to or be
                            forced to leave as well as economic incentives for those Europeans who
                            choose to remain.</p>
                        <p>(b) It calls for the formation of a Rhodesian Parliament in which the
                            European minority would have a sufficiently strong force [<hi
                                rend="italic">voice</hi>]<note n="5" xml:id="d199fn5">Bracketed
                                insertion by the editor.</note> to make sure unacceptable
                            constitutional changes do not occur.</p>
                        <p>(c) It foresees the organization of a moderate black government,
                            preferably with <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Joshua Nkomo</persName> as
                            the Chief Minister, which could hold European support and
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>(d) It predicates an orderly transfer of power so that the discipline of
                            Rhodesia’s security forces and civil service is maintained.</p>
                        <p>(e) British political representation in Salisbury is provided for in
                            order to add stability to the process of transition. Britain’s political
                            presence would remain long enough—eighteen months to two years—<pb
                                n="517" facs="0556" xml:id="pg_517"/>to give white Rhodesians a
                            chance to make a reasonable estimate of their future and prospects.</p>
                        <p>(f) Finally, the plan foresees the lifting of economic sanctions and the
                            active encouragement of private foreign investment.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Scenario</p>
                        <p>—The plan for bringing Rhodesia to majority rule spells out those steps
                            which will lead up to independence. In summary, these steps include:</p>
                        <p>(a) The present regime would accept the principle of majority rule and
                            give way to a caretaker government. The Rhodesian Legislative Assembly
                            would be dissolved.</p>
                        <p>(b) The caretaker government would begin negotiations with black
                            Rhodesians and the governments of African states would declare their
                            support for the process.</p>
                        <p>(c) The Parliament of the United Kingdom would pass enabling legislation
                            and appoint representation.</p>
                        <p>(d) The caretaker government would give way to an interim administration
                            in which <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Joshua Nkomo</persName> would serve
                            as Chief Minister. At this point, economic sanctions would be raised and
                            the insurgency brought to an end.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Political Understandings</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Political Assurances.</hi> The assurances contained in
                            the plan are general and are designed to provide the basis for further
                            negotiations. Once a caretaker government and Rhodesia’s black
                            nationalists, with British representatives present, sit down at the
                            bargaining table, the details will be negotiated in a manner which meets
                            the realities of the present situation.</p>
                        <p>—Whatever the precise outcome, the political understandings would be
                            based on a constitutional declaration of rights protecting every
                            individual regardless of color, race or tribe.</p>
                        <p>—Loss of property without compensation would be prohibited.</p>
                        <p>—An independent judiciary would be established; its authorities would be
                            protected under the constitution.</p>
                        <p>—An independent electoral commission would draw electoral boundaries but
                            the precise form of the franchise would have to be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>—In organizing the legislature, it is understood that European Rhodesians
                            would have a sufficiently strong voice to make sure that unacceptable
                            constitutional changes do not occur.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Interim Government.</hi> The transitional
                            administration would be legalized by Britain and would be formed with
                            British cooperation.</p>
                        <pb n="518" facs="0557" xml:id="pg_518"/>
                        <p>—Britain would appoint a representative in Salisbury and Parliament would
                            pass a new act which would give the British government the powers it
                            needs to carry out its responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>—The act would contain provisions to protect officers of the present
                            government from prosecution or civil suit for acts retrospectively
                            determined illegal.</p>
                        <p>—The precise form of interim government remains to be worked out; to an
                            important degree it will have to be negotiated between the present
                            regime and the African nationalists. However, it is understood that
                            Britain will play a role in the government; the interim regime would
                            include both blacks and Europeans.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Economic Incentives and Assurances</p>
                        <p>The economic section of the plan defines the undertakings of the
                            international community as well as those of the future Rhodesian
                            government. The plan, moreover, addresses the country’s future economic
                            development, public and private investment, and the economic security of
                            the European community.</p>
                        <p>—It is understood that no third country contributing resources to the
                            Rhodesian economic program would do so until those resources had been
                            approved under normal constitutional processes.</p>
                        <p>—The system of economic assurances as it relates to the future of
                            European community is designed to maximize incentives for white
                            Rhodesians to stay rather than leave, to improve prospects that the new
                            government will honor its commitments, and to guarantee the security of
                            new investments, both foreign and domestic. The assurances are based on
                            the fundamental principle that the new government will be committed to
                            the respect of private property or fair value compensation, should
                            property be nationalized.</p>
                        <p>—The plan spells out a program of special arrangements for the European
                            community in four important areas:</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Pensions.</hi> The existing terms of public service
                            with respect to pensions and severance pay would be maintained for all
                            pensionable officials, police and members of the armed forces.</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Household Property.</hi> To maintain the value of
                            household property, stand-by purchase arrangements would be made which
                            would provide 30 percent of the 1975 value of a house if it were sold in
                            the first year of Rhodesian independence and 75 percent if it were sold
                            in the fifth. To guard against inflation, house values would be
                            index-linked. Transactions could be carried out under a special
                            residential property holding corporation.</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Farm Lands.</hi> A new agricultural land commission
                            would be established to repurchase agricultural properties being vacated
                            by Euro<pb n="519" facs="0558" xml:id="pg_519"/>peans. Compensation
                            would take place along the lines similar to that designed for the
                            repurchase of houses. However, payments would be spread over a longer
                            period of time.</p>
                        <p>(d) <hi rend="italic">Transfer of Assets.</hi> The new government would
                            permit a reasonable flow of remittances. A European deciding to leave
                            immediately could convert and remit 10 percent of his liquid assets or a
                            lump sum of, for example, <gloss target="#t_RH_1">RH</gloss> $5000 in
                            the first year and an additional 10 percent in each year thereafter.
                            Incentives would be designed to encourage Europeans to keep earnings,
                            savings and profits within Rhodesia by providing for larger remittances
                            in future years.</p>
                        <p>—The international community would be organized to underwrite the special
                            assurances of the new government to its European community and a
                            mechanism in the form of an internationally managed trust fund would be
                            set up. While acquisition of lands, homes and pension payments would be
                            financed from internal Rhodesian sources, the trust fund would back up
                            government commitments and provide seed capital. The fund would also
                            provide the Rhodesian government with the foreign exchange necessary to
                            enable it to maintain remittances.</p>
                        <p>—The British Government would assume responsibility for bringing together
                            the international trust fund. The United States Government would assist
                            the British Government in this regard. The size of the fund is yet to be
                            decided.</p>
                        <p>—Special attention is given in the plan to the generation of foreign
                            investment resources for Rhodesia’s development—particularly in the most
                            promising sectors of the nation’s economic activity, national [<hi

                            Development could be a cooperative, international, public and private
                            sector undertaking. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD_1">IBRD</gloss> would be
                            asked to sponsor an international consortium of private resources firms
                            which would encourage and guide the flow of investment.</p>
                        <p>—The independent government would be eligible to adhere to the Lome
                                Convention<note n="7" xml:id="d199fn7">The Lome Convention, signed
                                on February 28, 1975, was an agreement between the African,
                                Caribbean, and Pacific Countries (ACP) group and the European
                                Community that aimed at supporting the ACP states’ development
                                efforts.</note> and benefit from the European Development Fund.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, the plan addresses the question of foreign economic assistance
                            to improve the situation of Rhodesia’s black majority. International
                            consultative arrangements would be made under World Bank supervision to
                            coordinate government to government aid. In the first instance, aid
                            would be directed on a priority basis to the development of black skills
                            and agriculture.</p>

                                    >Schaufele</persName>, August 17, summarizing British
                                reservations about a summary (Tab B to <ref target="#d199">Document
                                    199</ref>) that <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                                    >Botha</persName> on August 16. The British reservations were
                                that the summary implied the British would assume responsibility for
                                Rhodesia during the interim period; that the summary did not
                                emphasize that majority rule had to be reached within one and
                                one-half to two years; and that the summary did not stipulate that
                                the plan had the full financial and political support of the British
                                Government. The British wanted <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1"
                                    >Botha</persName> to have the full text, not just the
                                summary.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [Reads it:] I didn’t
                            know Sir Anthony Duff was going to <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: We just found out
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The British perception
                            is 100% the opposite of ours. They want to tie up the South Africans
                            totally before any other move.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: And they want more
                            traditional negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: Two out of three of their
                            gripes are hogwash. Obviously the time frame has to be short, and
                            obviously they’re not bound unless the others are.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Their method will lead
                            to a stalemate. <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> will say
                            no; that immediately stalemates their efforts in black Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: The Duff mission was
                            first meant to backstop yours, and to show it has British full faith and
                            credit.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Bullshit. It’s our
                            full faith and credit that’s important to South Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: If you give the South
                            Africans the full text, they’ll nitpick.</p>
                        <pb n="521" facs="0560" xml:id="pg_521"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I gave them only
                            the summary because the full text was too favorable to the whites. I’m
                            afraid we won’t be able to deliver it all.</p>
                        <p>Get <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Samuel</persName> in and tell him: We’ll
                            make absolutely sure the South Africans understand it’s a summary.
                            Second, we agree it should be under two years; in fact we think it
                            should be one year.</p>
                        <p>Third, we urgently disagree with passing the full document because once
                            that’s accepted, it deprives us of all flexibility in the negotiation.
                            Once we get off it, it’ll lead to massive difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In addition, their method won’t work. Support [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Suppose</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> says
                            fine; Duff will run up to Dar and give the document there. It will
                            explode.</p>
                        <p>Maybe they think they’ll conduct the negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: They know the South
                            Africans don’t trust them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They may think that
                            with the South Africans signed up, they can do it.</p>
                        <p>My objection was that the document was too favorable to the Rhodesians
                            and deprived us of flexibility. We want their general agreement so we
                            can wrap it up in one final assault. Instead of this stately
                            process.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Is there any difference
                            between the summary and final document?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I don’t think so. The
                            qualifiers aren’t there, though.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The inconsistency is
                            between what we want and what they want. They want to topple Smith; we
                            want a solution. They think they can conduct the negotiation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: Did they accept the
                            text?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s their text.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: They have a domestic
                            problem with overextending their responsibilities. They can say to
                            Parliament this is as far as they can go.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They misread the South
                            Africans. And if they go to the blacks and say it’s accepted by the
                            South Africans, they certainly won’t accept a South African plan. We’ll
                            give the blacks even less.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: That’s their assumption.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRC_1">Samuel</persName> knows that.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> pushes Smith on the
                            issue of accepting black-white parity in a future Rhodesian
                            parliament.</p>
                        <p>3. Among the more notable points of interest [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>—Smith’s first priority is to clearly establish authority in the security
                            field as this is vital and basic to successful negotiations. In this
                            regard, Rhodesian security depends a great deal on the concept of the
                                <pb n="524" facs="0563" xml:id="pg_524"/>“Fire Force” which utilizes
                            helicopters both to track terrorists to their camps and to direct ground
                            forces to seek out and destroy these camps.</p>
                        <p>—According to Smith, <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss> has
                            been firing 122mm rockets against Rhodesian targets for some time,
                            necessitating a Rhodesian offensive which knocked out the positions and
                            destroyed ammunition in Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss> has so many internal and
                            factional problems that they are killing one another “by the day, by the
                            dozen”, according to Rhodesian estimates.</p>
                        <p>—Smith believes that Zambian President <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kenneth Kaunda</persName> and nationalist leader <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Joshua Nkomo</persName> are still Rhodesia’s best
                            bet, not necessarily a good bet but the best bet. Nonetheless, Smith
                            alleges that <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> has been
                            acting “irresponsibly” and Smith is under pressure within his party to
                            remove him. If there are <gloss target="#t_ZAPU_1">ZAPU</gloss>
                            guerrilla attacks from Zambia, Smith will have no option but to
                            “neutralize him”. In response to Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s objections to such a course
                            of action, Smith said he has withstood these pressures thus far, but
                            with <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> consorting with the
                            terrorists it is difficult to argue against the proponents of
                            “neutralization”.</p>
                        <p>—Speaking of <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>’s standing with
                            the blacks in Rhodesia, Smith said he is in the minority. Bishop
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName>, although out of the
                            country, still has a surprising amount of support within Rhodesia.
                            According to Smith, <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName>’s
                            faction has indicated that if there are going to be more talks, they
                            would like to be in, and not out, this time. Smith attributes this to
                            the government’s efforts to convince the tribal chiefs and, through
                            them, their followers that the best thing to do is to cooperate and work
                            with the Rhodesian Government.</p>
                        <p>—Smith’s political objective is gradually to mobilize more support from
                            the blacks, particularly urban blacks, in order to be in a position to
                            say that he has the support of blacks, as well as whites. In response to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s query regarding
                            Smith’s conception of ultimate majority rule, Smith said his aim is the
                            best possible government, “irrespective of color”. “What we aim to do is
                            to have certain standards”, but he did not “believe that the path to
                            majority rule was something that could be measured in terms of the clock
                            or the calendar”.</p>
                        <p>—In response to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s comment
                            that American interest has introduced a new dimension into the Rhodesian
                            situation, Smith said he believes this is an advantage—the more that
                            countries like America, France and West Germany can be implicated, the
                            better. “It can only strengthen our hands”. The Organization of African
                            Unity (<gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>) will oppose any solution to
                            the situation, even a reasonable one, and the support of these Western
                            countries will be valuable.</p>
                        <p>—Smith said communist terrorism in Rhodesia must be stopped and, in this
                            regard, he sees a chance for a breakthrough in what he un<pb n="525"
                                facs="0564" xml:id="pg_525"/>derstood to be the American decision to
                            suspend support for Mozambique as long as terrorists continue to operate
                            from Mozambique.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> noted that the West was
                            frightened by the possibility of a communist or Marxist takeover in
                            Rhodesia similar to that in Angola, but at the same time the West
                            believed that to prevent such a takeover, the non-Marxist and even
                            non-militant blacks must be advanced politically. The West, <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> said, is wedded to the idea of
                            one man, one vote—they don’t look upon Rhodesians as black and white;
                            they look upon them as people.</p>
                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> feels certain that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> will not be
                            reelected, and that <persName corresp="#p_CJ_2">Jimmy Carter</persName>
                            is the next man with whom the South Africans will be dealing. Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName> said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> was believed to be
                            on his way out as well, but that if he could be given something (some
                            evidence of progress), he might make a special final effort to be of
                            assistance, not only to improve his image but to give the <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> administration something to show
                            to the public before the election.</p>
                        <p>—In Smith’s view, the compelling argument to be used in discussions with
                            the Americans or other Westerners should be that they do not want a
                            repeat of Angola and Mozambique, that is, a communist takeover of
                            Rhodesia. In <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s view,
                            should the Soviets and Cubans move into Rhodesia tomorrow in full force,
                            apart from shouting to high heaven, nobody is going to lift a finger to
                            stop them. Before the West will listen, Smith must offer some concrete
                            evidence that he is prepared to move toward majority rule.</p>
                        <p>—In talking to the West, <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            said South Africa has a similar weakness in the South West Africa
                            issue—“you can’t talk [<hi rend="italic">take</hi>?] the timetable
                            question out of their heads, yet the question of a timetable is entirely
                            in the hands of the South West African peoples. South Africa is not
                            prepared to specify a schedule and will not allow the United Nations or
                            anybody else to lay down a schedule.”</p>
                        <p>—Smith told <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> that in
                            pressing him for a firm statement about ultimate intentions, the South
                            Africans are asking the Rhodesians to “sign our death warrant and to put
                            a certain time limit on it. We are going to try to get the maximum time
                            and we want to leave ourselves in the best possible position to maneuver
                            and to negotiate. Smith would have to discuss any such statements with
                            his colleagues in Salisbury, as he had during the negotiations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>. When the talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> broke down, his
                            colleagues in the Rhodesian Front heaved a sigh of relief and said well
                            thank God, we worked through that one and we are now back to where we
                            were.”</p>
                        <p>—Smith would make no promises regarding parity in Parliament, and said it
                            would be a very difficult concept for him to persuade his colleagues to
                            accept. Moreover, there is a hardening attitude in the Rhode<pb n="526"
                                facs="0565" xml:id="pg_526"/>sian Front Party against settlement,
                            against compromise—many have told Smith that he has already gone too far
                            in bringing so many blacks into the government.</p>
                        <p>—Then, all we can tell Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> now, said <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>, is that you are more determined than ever to
                            face the escalating terrorism; you are prepared to face the economic
                            problems which are ahead; and you are no longer sure that you can agree
                            even to parity. In response Smith said, “We must go on for majority rule
                            but this must be evolutionary as opposed to revolution; I believe I’ve
                            the majority of black support in this—not only white support.”</p>
                        <p>4. The overall impression is that Smith is dodging and hedging and shows
                            little inclination to accept <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>’s recommendations.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Most of what came out

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: More than <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Because his experiences
                            are more recent. And he is pragmatic. Because he fears an armed struggle
                            on his territory.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Fears?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Yes. He fears
                            internationalization of the struggle. He is perceptive about the
                            transition period. He feared an undefeated white army, and a police
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>Duff: <gloss target="#t_FRELIMO_1">FRELIMO</gloss> history is that they
                            defeated Portugal.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But what are the

                                >FRELIMO</gloss> nor the Angolan groups were gaining much until
                            Portugal collapsed. But it’s irrelevant, because it’s the myth.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: He feared a divided
                            security situation with the Rhodesian army and his forces intact. So he
                            felt it should be telescoped. He thinks he can win by peaceful means
                            anyway: If the guerrillas participate in the negotiations, he feels his
                            people can win.</p>
                        <p>He was also extremely suspicious about our approach—thinking we’re trying
                            to put in a Western-based government, a puppet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He’s right!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: He’s afraid we’re trying
                            to perpetuate a colonial system. He’ll be more critical of the guarantee
                            scheme.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You didn’t give him
                            the scheme.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: No. We said something
                            like this might be important for the economic development of
                            Zimbabwe.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Their impressions were,
                            number one, personal—his intelligence—and number two, that he doesn’t
                            want an internationalization of the war. And number three, he is
                            genuinely sympathetic to our proceeding on these lines.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: He was extremely shaken
                            by these attacks from Rhodesia. He hadn’t expected that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That impression
                            coincides with ours. He approached us after the attack, and expressed a
                            real interest in what we were doing.</p>
                        <pb n="529" facs="0568" xml:id="pg_529"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: He was the only one who
                            had a brief, and had read into it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: (gesturing at the
                            Secretary’s lack of a briefing book:) That’s not a terribly tactful
                            thing to say. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We briefed you, as you
                            did us, on a daily basis. Our impression substantially coincides with
                            yours.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Rhodesia, the various leaders including <persName
                                corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName> wish us well in the effort, but
                            have confused and slightly disagreeing notions of how to bring it to a
                            conclusion.</p>
                        <p>All of them distrust Smith. All of them give you credit for rejecting our
                            proposal for colonial rule. (Laughter) All of them agree the government
                            won’t be headed by <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> but must
                            be more broadly based.</p>
                        <p>But the question is what they mean by these general formulations. They’re
                            all, except <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>, totally
                            mystified by how they’ll unify the Zimbabwe nationalists. It is easier
                            to blame the white governments than themselves.</p>
                        <p>I have the impression, which may be wrong, that they are scarcely less
                            terrified we won’t deliver Smith than that we will deliver Smith.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, these leaders—again except for Machel—are uncertain what they
                            can deliver. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>, if alone, would be
                            fairly responsive to the kind of plan we have, and willing to take two
                            risks—that Smith will not accept, or that Smith will accept and they
                            will be accused by Machel of selling out the others. So they are torn
                            between fear of failure and fear of success.</p>
                        <p>Machel knows what he is doing. He wants a Rhodesian government as
                            analogous to his as he can get, and achieved by methods as analogous to
                            his as he can get.</p>
                        <p>The formula they have all hit on as a way out of this is to put in a
                            transitional government now, with a black majority, and after that they
                            will unify the Zimbabwean nationalists.</p>
                        <p>Rogers: It’s <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>’s view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And <persName
                                corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>’s.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: What <persName
                                corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName> wants overridingly is a peaceful
                            settlement. The other is secondary.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The problem we have—I
                            don’t know about the U.K.—I don’t see how we can put in a black
                            government unconditionally without any prior assurances of what it will
                            be like.</p>
                        <p>Duff: We haven’t seen that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we haven’t any
                            proposals like this. They say it orally: if the transitional government
                            is put in, their fear of Smith’s duplicity disappears.</p>
                        <pb n="530" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_530"/>
                        <p>Duff: With us, they all accepted the interim stage to negotiate a new
                            government. He said to us: who is going to be the negotiator with the
                            Zimbabwean nationalists?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There are two
                            possibilities: A white government different from <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> negotiates majority rule
                            with British non-colonial assistance. The second situation is they
                            insist a black majority government is put in immediately, with some
                            white participation, and that negotiates a constitution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Nowhere did we have
                            difficulty with the idea of a white caretaker government to negotiate
                            with the blacks. <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName> kept
                            asking who will be the “new force” the Zimbabweans would negotiate with?
                            We said the caretaker government. <persName corresp="#p_MS_2"
                                >Machel</persName> didn’t demur at that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: For how long would it
                            be?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: A very short time.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our people say 10 days
                            to two weeks.</p>
                        <p>Duff: “A matter of weeks.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can see a white
                            government without Smith negotiating. It’s not for us to say how long,
                            but ten days to two weeks means in effect immediately. A serious
                            negotiation for guarantees wouldn’t be years but at least months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: I think without Smith,
                            they would be more flexible—ten days or three months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We don’t mind if they
                            settle. But is it a serious negotiation, or an immediate handover?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: We weren’t sure how far
                            we could go in our initial soundings. We both fudged it because we
                            didn’t want to unveil the package.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The experience of the
                            two Bills was that whenever they discussed the package, the Presidents
                            said: “This is mechanics.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Yes. They said: “Smith
                            must go.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Your conclusion is:
                            Number one, Smith must go. Number two, there must be a negotiation
                            between a successor white government and a black negotiating team. They
                            will then agree on a provisional government. Independence comes into
                            being some stated period thereafter. Full independence, Bill?</p>
                        <p>Rogers: You have come away with a clearer impression than we did of a
                            serious negotiation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our impression is they
                            are really saying to us: “Hand over power first, and we will sort out
                            the unity of the Zimbabwean nationalists.” <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> is saying: “Let’s first sort out the unity of
                            the Zimbabwean nationalists and then hand over power.”</p>
                        <p>Frankly, this would greatly affect my discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="531" facs="0570" xml:id="pg_531"/>
                        <p>Duff: <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> didn’t want to get
                            into the mechanics, but he said: “Maybe with a new white government,
                            that in itself would be a catalyst for the blacks to get together.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Caretaker means a
                            white government?</p>
                        <p>Rogers: Yes. “Caretaker” means a non-Smith white government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Not <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ian</hi> Smith.</p>
                        <p>Rogers: Non-Ian.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PM_1">Palliser</persName>: One element is the very
                            deep suspicion of these Africans of Smith, <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>, and your relationship with them. We think if it
                            is clear Smith is for the birds, the other difficulties will go.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They ask us to use our
                            influence with the South Africans; then when we do it, they are
                            suspicious.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Their suspicions would
                            grow if they see no results, if Smith hangs around. If they see results,
                            I think the problems will disappear.</p>
                        <p>To summarize: <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> is not
                            willing to talk about beyond stage one, but I think if Smith is
                            delivered, he’ll go along.</p>
                        <p>With <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>, we went over the
                            caretaker government. He didn’t demur; he said it’s mechanics which we
                            could talk about. His concern is he couldn’t organize the blacks. The
                            blacks would come in; we would legalize it; and he would be left holding
                            the “hot baby,” as he put it.</p>
                        <p>With <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>, I went over the
                            caretaker idea. Then the interim government I said would be responsible
                            for the security situation. Then he said it would be short.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What about
                            guarantees?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: He’s against it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Implicitly against
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So he’s for expulsion
                            of the whites.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: The other two will
                            accept it and influence him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So it will all depend
                            on who controls the interim government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Your fear is we may end
                            up with a black government that may drive out the whites. If we proceed
                            down this road, this is one risk we have to take. This looms larger than
                            five weeks ago. The question is, do we proceed?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To describe the worst
                            thing that can happen: A white government that comes in under massive
                            American pressure. The blacks then break apart, and war breaks out, and
                            you have an Angola in Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: But they are all against
                            it.</p>
                        <pb n="532" facs="0571" xml:id="pg_532"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the question then
                            is, why did it have to be us? Americans would rather, I think, see the
                            blacks overthrow the whites than see us do it.</p>

                            that. The blacks would not have the power to drive them out.</p>

                            23 of which supported it. After months of public education, I have
                            received 120 letters of which 36 support it. So I have moved from 99%
                            against to 66% against.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: My experience is the
                            same. My constituency in Grimsby is restrained by illiteracy, and most
                            of the mail concerns whether I wear white tie with the Queen.</p>
                        <p>But there will be a military confrontation in Rhodesia, because the
                            whites will fight.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would David Smith be

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would he fight, as the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PM_1">Palliser</persName>: There would be a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would David Smith
                            fight?</p>
                        <p>Duff: No. But he would be replaced by those who could.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: The four Presidents would
                            be eager for a political settlement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will they remain
                            united?</p>
                        <p>Rogers: I don’t think so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Nor I.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can any black
                            President take a position less radical than any other?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Only if the end is in
                            view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So we’re back at the
                            position of before: The British view is that the removal of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> unlocks everything. My view
                            has been no, but I’m open minded.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: We couldn’t tell them
                            how Smith would be got to yield. Neither I nor Bill could tell them how.
                            So they weren’t focusing on beyond that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are they saying this
                            because the problems are so overwhelming on their side that they want to
                            blame it on the whites, or is it what they really believe? Really the
                            reason I ask is that they send us imploring letters not to move “on the
                            ground” because they’re not <pb n="533" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_533"
                            />ready. From this I conclude they think we’re ready to deliver and
                            they’re not.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: They’re ambivalent. If
                            we take your main fear—that the outcome of this initiative may not be
                            our peaceful plan but a black takeover—if we do nothing, won’t we be
                            worse off?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But are we better
                            off?</p>
                        <p>Now to my problem with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>.
                            Basically the only way we can proceed, on your analysis, is for the
                            United States to ask <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> to
                            overthrow Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And we can’t tell him
                            anything that will happen. We can’t tell him guarantees, we can’t tell
                            him anything. Is his domestic situation strong enough? Especially
                            because some in his country can plausibly say his getting into this
                            negotiation has weakened his situation in South Africa. In June my
                            argument to him was that this would buy him time for his own
                                problems.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">See <ref target="#d196"
                                    >Document 196</ref>.</note> I can’t tell him this now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: He’ll say he can’t agree
                            until he knows whether the blacks will sign on to the guarantee
                            program.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: We think you can get it
                            from the black Presidents if you can promise them Smith’s head.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Yes, because we could
                            never put the whole package to them. The guarantees are part of the
                            whole package.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’re now at your
                            first question: What can I say to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>? If I ask him only to deliver Smith’s head, can
                            I say we will support his successor in the request for guarantees?
                            [Assent from the British side.] The successor to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> says he will agree to
                            majority rule under conditions of guarantees.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then the blacks have
                            lost their excuse, or the reality, of their suspicions. Will the blacks
                            agree to guarantees?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Yes. But which comes
                            first?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m willing to say
                            Smith’s head goes first.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> has never said he’ll
                            deliver Smith’s head. Can we tell him we will support the guarantee
                            package?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: The purpose of your
                            visit to black Africa was to say: If you can agree to a guarantee
                            package, then the British and the US will give their backing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, exactly right.
                            That hasn’t changed.</p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="0573" xml:id="pg_534"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Smith has to go, and
                            guarantees. You would also say to him that neither we nor he will agree
                            unless the blacks agree to guarantees in a more definite way. It depends
                            on the four Presidents.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do they have a veto?
                            Will we be driven to accept anything they ask? Or there is a point where
                            we say: “From here on you get it for yourselves.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: For the British it is a
                            precondition of going forward that the four Presidents accept.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s reality. Without
                            the four Presidents, it’s not possible. The only differences between
                            what we said before our two missions and now are: We are saying now that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> has to go before
                            the negotiations, and secondly, guarantees will have to be worked out in
                            the negotiations between his successor and the blacks.</p>
                        <p>Duff: No. In the first place, the incoming caretaker government will have
                            to have knowledge of, and make public knowledge of, the guarantee
                            schemes, if it’s going to get public support. We’ll have to back it.
                            This in turn means we’ll have to discuss guarantees, both political and
                            economic, with the African side up to a point, so they don’t reject them
                            out of hand. The escape route for us is if they fail to agree, the whole
                            thing is off.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The second one is that
                            the Zimbabwean national team is a less attractive one than we thought a
                            few months ago.</p>
                        <p>I don’t think the American national interest, or yours, is served by
                            another Angola in Rhodesia. I’d rather have it come from the logic of
                            events.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Presumably something
                            will come out of this meeting [in Dar es Salaam] this weekend.<note

                                and the Front Line Presidents met in Dar es Salaam September 5–7.
                                The meeting led to continued support for the Rhodesian African
                                nationalists; there was no resolution of the conflict among the
                                rival groups. (<hi rend="italic">Keesing’s Contempory Archives,
                                    1976</hi>, p. 28041)</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On the one hand, I
                            welcome the meeting. It is the statesmanlike way of proceeding. Because
                            of the missions we sent, which saw them all separately, there is no
                            other way for them to give [<hi rend="italic">get</hi>?] a
                            consensus.</p>
                        <p>The danger is when they start blowing smoke at each other, no one will
                            dare to be realistic. They’ll get into fight talk and state unrealistic
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>When our people discussed Namibia, we heard the maximum position and we
                            were told that modifications were possible. If we were negotiating with
                            Lusaka, the negotiations could get started and it <pb n="535"
                                facs="0574" xml:id="pg_535"/>would fall together. Once eight parties
                            get together, there is no way to tell what will come out of it.</p>
                        <p>This is why I’m going back. Is this what you would have recommended?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And none of us knows
                            what <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> will do.</p>
                        <p>We briefed you as soon as we decided. Our problem is if we didn’t tell
                            the press then, it would look like <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> wasn’t cooperative. That would be disastrous in
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Your problem with
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> is you need to tell
                            him the Africans will accept this package. Our problem in Africa was we
                            couldn’t make this offer to them—we couldn’t say we would deliver Smith
                            if they accept the guarantees.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can handle it this
                            way. I can ask <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: If he is
                            willing to remove Smith, I’ll put it conditionally to the Africans. Then
                            when I go to Africa, I can tell the four Presidents that I can deliver
                            Smith if they’ll accept the guarantees. Then I will tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>, “You now deliver Smith.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: From our domestic
                            point of view, it would be better if the caretaker government in
                            Salisbury initiates the negotiation, rather than Dar. That isn’t more
                            difficult. Whether <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> will
                            agree, I can’t imagine.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: The advantage of this is
                            you can say to the blacks: “This is what <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"

                            along with it firmly, we’re in business.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have given the
                            South Africans the summary paper.<note n="5" xml:id="d202fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d199">Document 199</ref>, Tab B.</note> They have
                            accepted it in principle, or nearly. Then on Friday I gave them the
                            whole package. I didn’t want a formal presentation because it almost
                            certainly will be modified in the negotiations, and we would be accused
                            of duplicity.</p>
                        <p>All right, I understand the problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I suppose there is
                            nothing to be said for your sending telegrams to the five in the course
                            of this meeting, saying it would be helpful to have a more collective
                            negotiation, assuming your meeting with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> goes all right. It would be better than meeting
                            separately.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I had concluded that
                            it would be better if I didn’t communicate with them while they are
                            meeting. They think—erroneously—that we need this for electoral reasons.
                            The blacks will vote Democratic anyway; the whites in favor of it are
                            liberal Democrats. It <pb n="536" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_536"/>will
                            alienate those who fought the President before. So it will be a net
                            loss; if we break even, we will do all right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> told us—I think you
                            know—“If we give you Namibia, is that enough?” [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Most Americans think Namibia is a soft drink. [Laughter] So I don’t want
                            to be importuning them.</p>
                        <p>The problem is if this fails, nothing can be done for six months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So this is the only
                            way it is affected by the elections. If there is a change of
                            Administration on November 2, nothing could be organized until March.
                            That’s too late for Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>Do we want to let it drift?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: But you can’t change
                            horses in midstream.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I could screw up my
                            negotiation with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: There is no way to turn
                            the tap off once the next round of warfare begins. It’s the rainy
                            season. We know they’re planning kidnapping and killing of white women.
                            The South Africans will see their first television war. There will be
                            volunteers going up there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’re saying we have
                            to move now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: We have to move now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have felt this
                            meeting of theirs would last until Tuesday.<note n="6" xml:id="d202fn6"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Bill can brief your

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Just a word about this
                            meeting of the five. Who took the initiative?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Why?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He reflected on his
                            dilemma: I would come down and ask him for commitments, and he couldn’t
                            deliver. And the others would be in the same position. So it was
                            actually the wise way to proceed.</p>

                        <p>The first we heard was Thursday night.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: He had already decided
                            when we were there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The question is:
                            Should we write him a letter and ask him to form a five-power
                            negotiating team? Or leave it to them how to handle it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Their instinct is to
                            leave it to the Zimbabweans to negotiate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My instinct is to
                            leave it alone.</p>
                        <p>Bill?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: That’s my

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’ve got a brilliant
                            career ahead of you. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: The problem is that they
                            not come up with a new list of demands.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no objection if
                            your Ambassador did this. Anything they get from me, from today on,
                            they’re liable to think was affected by my meeting with <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I agree. They’re likely
                            to think that.</p>
                        <p>As for our Ambassador, I don’t think it’s a good idea. They’re not
                            novices; they know what the problem is.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: We’ll just have to take
                            a chance.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We’ll just have to take
                            a chance. One is whether they will add public demands. Second is they
                            will just leave it to the Zimbabweans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: The whole purpose of the
                            meeting is to put together a credible Zimbabwean nationalist team.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My nightmare is
                            they’ll publish a program we can’t accept.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: I would be surprised if
                            they did that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If they did?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: If they did. I don’t
                            think they see unity in those terms. They want operational unity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I see the meeting as
                            positive. If they can find unity or not. If not, it’s better to find out
                            now.</p>
                        <p>On getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName>, I’m
                            willing to take that up with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>. And I’ll tell him if he agrees, we will put it
                            to the four Presidents that if they agree to the guarantees, he will do
                            it.</p>
                        <p>It will be a pleasant meeting. The Dutch Reformed don’t have confession,
                            do they? [Laughter]</p>

                            as a government. If the omens are good on Monday . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m, of course,
                            assuming you’re prepared to proceed on a jointly prepared paper.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: It is virtually certain.
                            But I can’t tell what the Prime Minister will do.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The paper is the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can you give us Annex
                            C? If we agree with it, we can give it to the South Africans.</p>
                        <p>Duff: Yes. (He gives the Secretary Tab A)<note n="10" xml:id="d202fn10"
                                >Tab A is an undated British discussion paper entitled “Rhodesia:

                                Transition.”</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we talk about
                            Namibia?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I see no essential
                            differences between the two positions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate that our
                            two delegations spoke to the Africans in practically identical
                            terms.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate it. On
                            both Rhodesia and Namibia.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, the issue is to have the Windhoek Conference moved to
                            Geneva, and have <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> participate,
                            and some <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> involvement. And maybe get
                            some prisoners released. What may not be possible is to turn the Geneva
                            Conference immediately into a <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                            >SWAPO</gloss>–South African negotiation.</p>
                        <p>We get two signals. One is that one side can call it one thing and the
                            other will call it another. That doesn’t bother me. The other signal is
                            that we will get more demands—that South Africa immediately withdraw its
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>My feeling is that once the Conference is assembled, it will be the
                            outcome of independence. But I think there is a limit to how far
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> can go in the first
                            round. So this is the area of uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>We can probably figure out some way for South African participation. We
                            need some way to get this Conference going. Once it gets going, it will
                            develop its own logic. If it were just one, we could say this. But when
                            they’re all together, what <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>
                            advises them no one knows.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: I don’t think there will
                            be problems on these others, but the basic precondition was
                            unstated—that South Africa participates. I don’t see how <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> can participate in the Conference,
                            call it what you will, if South Africa demonstrably refuses to
                            participate.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll see. The problem
                            is what we got is what <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>
                            asked for in June. And we got a date for independence, which he didn’t
                            ask for.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Probably <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> got it wrong and assumed the
                            South Africans were there, at the Windhoek Conference. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> said it didn’t make any
                            difference if the tribal groups, the “racist puppets,” were
                            there—because the South Africans were. The other preconditions would
                            drop away.</p>
                        <pb n="540" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_540"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I feel that too,
                            unless these guys lock themselves into something in Dar.</p>
                        <p>What will <persName corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> do? The Soviet
                            Ambassador made an attack on us—he lumped us together.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RSP_1">Ramsbotham</persName>: I wonder if it is
                            worth considering whether a British message to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>, urging them not to tie
                            themselves to something . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m more worried about
                            what they say publicly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I’m more worried about
                            what they say publicly on Namibia than on Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We could say that after
                            the visits of Duff and <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>,
                            it would be useful if they don’t make any public statements. We are
                            keeping the door open and we think they should.</p>
                        <p>(To <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>:) You still oppose
                            it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He was against our
                            doing it. If you told him it was your judgment, based on your
                            conversations, or your impression of our attitude, that they shouldn’t
                            commit themselves to anything . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Not to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIM_1">Kaduma</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lord</persName>: There’s some advantage in
                            doing it today, before you see <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They know we’re

                            me your darlings are going to kick me in the teeth. Have you seen the
                            Dar newspapers? They are debating whether to “invite me” to Africa to
                            continue the negotiations. They are saying the blacks will never be
                            party to anything that “perpetuates imperialism in Africa.”</p>
                        <p>It’s the Soviet line. It is what the Soviet Ambassador in Zambia was
                            saying. They are determined not to allow what happened in the Middle
                            East to happen again. Especially because in Africa we have no cards.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To me, the amazing
                            thing in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations is that both sides are nearly
                            identical in their approach to negotiating. Yet each one thinks it is
                            morally superior to the other.</p>
                        <p>I got a massage in the hotel in Jerusalem. The masseur said he prayed for
                            me every night. I said “How many kilometers are you willing to give up?”
                            He said: “Kilometers? None!” [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, Mr. Prime Minister, we have to discuss two things: the
                            substance of where we are going, and the contingencies that may arise
                            and the procedures we would follow.</p>
                        <p>On substance, we have three papers.</p>
                        <p>—One, the paper Britain handed us on Rhodesia [“Annex C” at Tab A].<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d203fn2">Tab A, “Annex C,” is attached but not
                                printed. The document is entitled “Rhodesia: Possible Constitutional
                                Arrangements for the Period of Transition.” See <ref
                                    target="#d202fn10">footnote 10, Document 202</ref>.</note> My
                            estimate is it is substantially agreed, allowing for the margin of
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>—Second, the document on economic and political guarantees for Rhodesia
                            as agreed between Rogers and <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1"
                                >Fourie</persName> [Tab B].<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">Attached at
                                Tab B is a paper entitled “International Economic Support for a
                                Rhodesia Settlement,” drafted by Rogers on September 5 and
                                designated “Rev[ision]—2.”</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: And the period.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is in the
                            document.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: The period for this
                            interim government. That, gentlemen, you must just accept from me: It’s
                            in the interest of both blacks and whites that it be as long as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But as we agreed
                            privately—I will state it as my view—what will determine the outcome of
                            the negotiation is not what is in the interest of whites and blacks but
                            the power relationship.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: The blacks will have
                            their view, but they will want it as long as possible. I don’t mean the
                            Dar blacks but <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE_1">Gabella</persName>. I am sure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We won’t oppose a
                            longer period, but we can’t be for more than 18 to 24 months. If the
                            Rhodesian blacks want it, in a manner that can express itself, we won’t
                            oppose it. In the formal plan, it will be 18–24 months unless both
                            parties agree to extend it.</p>
                        <pb n="543" facs="0582" xml:id="pg_543"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: Who is “both

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Whoever negotiates for
                            the whites and blacks.</p>
                        <p>—Then we have the document on South-West Africa [Tab C.]<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d203fn4">Attached at Tab C is an undated paper on Namibia
                                entitled “Basis for a Proposal.”</note></p>
                        <p>On Rhodesia: The first one [Tab A], the British already have, since they
                            wrote it. We will also give the economic one to the British.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, Duff is visiting you in Pretoria this week. My strong
                            recommendation is to say these papers were indeed worked out here; they
                            are under serious consideration, but there can be no final decision
                            until I have come. Because if you say you’ve accepted it, he will
                            immediately run to Dar. And on the political paper too. Say you are
                            sympathetically considering it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: Agreed. There is one
                            thing: [Reads from Tab A:] “Appointment of a Council of State by the
                            Queen on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Foreign and
                            Commonwealth Affairs . . .” Will the British be the sole judge of this?
                            So there is no misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: According to this
                            paper, yes. We can modify it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: Suppose they appoint
                            someone totally unacceptable to the whites? Like former Prime Minister
                            Todd, who is in disgrace.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Shall we say “in
                            consultations with both communities”?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: All right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBG_1">Van den Bergh</persName>: “In consultations”
                            still leaves them the final say.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It gives us something
                            to talk about [with the British] this afternoon.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d203fn5">No memorandum of conversation from this meeting has

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: If it’s not acceptable
                            to the whites, it will fall down immediately.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The British will say
                            “in consultation” anyway.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: As long as they realize
                            there is a reservation here that they must take into account.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Ambassador will
                            honor us Wednesday?<note n="6" xml:id="d203fn6">September 8.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will give you the
                            results Wednesday. You don’t need it before then.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName>: As soon as possible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Wednesday. Because I
                            want it in as little cable traffic as possible.</p>
                        <p>Any other problems with that paper?</p>
                        <pb n="544" facs="0583" xml:id="pg_544"/>
                        <p>Shall we go through the rest of it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: [Reads over Tab A:] In
                            this paper, what will be the position of the civil service, the army,
                            and police? Because that is a clue to the whole thing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In the interim
                            government?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Also, let’s put down
                            what you said: Although the time is 18–24 months, it can be extended by
                            agreement of both parties.</p>
                        <p>The army, police and civil service are under the interim government,
                            correct?</p>
                        <p>Rogers: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: And the independent
                            judiciary also.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All these things we
                            will confirm with your Ambassador Wednesday morning.</p>
                        <p>So much for the political paper. I am not trying to rush you, just to
                            find out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: I’ve said to you there
                            is merit in this but it is not binding on the Rhodesians.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand. It will
                            be urged on the Rhodesians.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName>: Whether there are three or
                            two, that will make it easier.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The question is, one,
                            whether the whites have a voice in the selection of the people appointed
                            by the Queen. Second, what happens to the army, police, and judiciary in
                            the period of the interim government. And three, whether the period can
                            be extended by the agreement of both parties.</p>
                        <p>Rogers: And the civil service.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p>Then there are two contingencies to consider.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: I must warn that the
                            composition of the Council will be shot down by Dar es Salaam and
                            Lusaka.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: It will be shot down in
                            flames immediately.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Therefore we should
                            leave some room for flexibility.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBG_1">Van den Bergh</persName>: And the local
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: That can be left for the
                            interim government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The whites have a
                            majority on the Council and the blacks have a majority in the Cabinet.
                            Since it is a British proposal, why not let them try it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: This ought to be
                            acceptable to them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName>: Especially if they are
                            consulted in the selection of the three.</p>
                        <pb n="545" facs="0584" xml:id="pg_545"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the
                            Council?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: It is the dictator. It is
                            the government, the executive authority.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName>: The British will argue:
                            You get the power later.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: The Cabinet is the
                            legislative power and the Council is the executive.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: But the Council has
                            legislative power too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: The British must not
                            change this for the worse; they can change it for the better.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If the British
                            judgment of what they can sell were correct, they would still be
                            governing in East Africa.</p>
                        <p>Rogers: And North America. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: I am willing to urge
                            this on Rhodesia. If the British keep their side of the bargain, and if
                            they don’t go wild on 8(i). And the five is better than the three.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: A man like <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> might accept it if he can make
                            the selection.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName>: We must assume their
                            Minister of State has been to Africa and sounded them out. <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no, no. One rule I
                            have learned in eight years is never underestimate the incompetence of
                            bureaucrats.</p>
                        <p>Once I read a long report of a Russian-American conversation on strategic
                            arms, of a complexity and subtlety I’d never seen a Russian use. I asked
                            the Soviet Ambassador. He looked into it and he found out it was our
                            fellow who proposed all of it and the Russian said he would consider
                            it!</p>
                        <p>Will the blacks accept this?</p>
                        <p>Rogers: If there is a time limit.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBG_1">Van den Bergh</persName>: They might agree
                            to it if there is an 18-month to two-year time limit.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: Eighteen months to two

                            If it is three years, it will be so much better.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I doubt it. We must be

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now let us take the
                            two contingencies—that Dar will tell me to go ahead, and that Dar tells
                            me not to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>If Dar tells me to go ahead, you should keep your agreement private until
                            I arrive in South Africa. I will meet with Smith and his Cabinet in
                            Pretoria, to add our weight to what has been said. Then it will be
                            announced—two weeks after I return to the United States, so I can manage
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>I would not give all this to the blacks. I would give the general outline
                            that I would work with you and Smith. I wouldn’t ask their approval of
                            any detail, because if they say no, we are in an endless
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>If—which I consider to be a 50–50 chance—the Dar meeting makes
                            intransigent demands, I think it is an even more important reason to put
                            this forward. Because the only way to resist enormous African pressures
                            is to say that the substance of the problem has been solved and the only
                            question is the method. It has to be done in a timeframe close to what
                            is in effect a declaration of war. The only way to avoid panic is for
                            Smith to announce this fairly rapidly. Then we will take position in the
                            U.S.—we can’t take a position in support of Smith but a position that
                            the negotiation was on the point of succeeding and the total program was
                            accepted, but the radical blacks, urged on by the Soviet Union, insisted
                            on a violent solution.</p>
                        <p>What we can’t have is that the blacks turn us down, and there is a
                            five-week debate on whose fault it is, and no one will remember who
                            proposed what.</p>
                        <p>We can say it was rejected by the radicals and the Communists and we will
                            go no further.</p>
                        <p>Larry, you are the expert. Will this be understood?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ELS_1">Eagleburger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we can get answers
                            to the three questions you asked, these are the two papers on the basis
                            of which we will proceed.</p>
                        <p>If I go to black Africa, I will keep it confused. If I go to Pretoria, I
                            will meet with Smith and his Cabinet. Two-three weeks after, he will
                            announce it as his program. Then we’re in a negotiation, and it will
                            have to be a matter of goodwill.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They will raise one and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will try to drag
                            out the debate, but this has to appear as early as possible to avoid
                            appearing to yield under pressure.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, I regret it.</p>
                        <p>I would not worry about Dar if it weren’t for the Soviets. They are
                            unhappy and remember the experience of the Middle East.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My worry about Dar was
                            not to be in the air for 15 hours while they are beating up on the
                            United States. I wanted to know where I was going. Because in America,
                            if there is any difference between the Secretary of State and a black
                            leader, I am wrong. Not just a black leader, but the Democratic
                            leadership. But if this comes off, it will have wide support.</p>
                        <p>When is the Security Council debate?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: 21–22 September.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I am not so worried
                            about the spillover on Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will tell you what
                            we will say: It’s now clear that a peaceful solution existed—majority
                            rule in short period of time. It failed only because the radical
                            elements, assisted by the Soviet Union, insisted on violence. The most
                            they ever asked for, had been achieved.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Can we delay it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It depends entirely on
                            what they decide in Dar.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: If Dar turns it down,
                            Smith has nothing to lose.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If Smith can be
                            induced to put this forward, he can’t put in 800 escape clauses. The
                            simpler the better.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: I understand. That is my
                            business.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He shouldn’t put in a
                            Council of State, etc. He should say: I am prepared immediately to have
                            an interim government with a black majority, and negotiate immediately.
                            It shouldn’t be in detail.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: We haven’t told the
                            Africans such detail, and they will resent it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: He will have to put in
                            the Council of State because he needs that to get European support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But this is after a
                            breakdown.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>: If you are on the trip,
                            you will see him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If it fails, the
                            necessity is to get on the table as soon as possible terms as favorable
                            as possible. If the people surprisingly say <pb n="548" facs="0587"
                                xml:id="pg_548"/>yes, he can then put forward the details—as long as
                            the general proposal was not misleading.</p>
                        <p>I would put forward the Council of State in the context of success; not
                            in the context of failure.</p>
                        <p>The interim government should be described in ambiguous terms but leaving
                            the implication of majority participation by the blacks.</p>

                            formula: “The interim government will be set up with the blacks, the

                            I can go myself to the Security Council and say we worked for five
                            months and achieved all we said we were for. I can cite the announcement
                            on Namibia and the Smith announcement on Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>The only thing we were against was violence. “This body can’t be for
                            violence.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName>: This final statement if
                            Smith should be cooperative—is this the final push for a solution?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What I will suggest to
                            the President, and my colleagues, is that we generate some resolution
                            that supports a peaceful solution in terms of the proposals that have
                            been made. If it fails, we will veto sanctions and probably veto a
                            contrary resolution.</p>
                        <p>I will have to discuss it with the President, because it will probably be
                            a major event in the election. It will probably help him to take a
                            strong stand, but I am not sure. In any event, you will know by
                            Thursday. The chances will be nine out of ten he will go along with the
                            strategy I have outlined. I personally think it will help him. I am
                            practically certain it will be accepted. But I do want to get the

                            has the advantage of suggesting that any side can raise any issue it
                            wishes. It’s tactically very important.</p>

                            tactically much better. We can tell the Africans: “Anything you want to
                            raise you can raise. It may not be agreed, but it will be discussed.” If
                            it has to be agreed, you have a veto over what is discussed.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think “may wish to

                            even if in fact they have already been done, the more impressive it will
                            be to world public opinion. It is better to say “the date for
                            independence will be . . .” than to say “the Constituent Assembly has
                            already announced the date will be . . . ” Because millions of people
                            don’t know it has already announced it.</p>

                            go to Dar and Lusaka prior to coming to Pretoria, sticking to the three
                            points they gave us but receiving some of their ideas which will include
                            some of these. You will take it to the Conference before I go. Then we
                            will take it back and say “Take it or leave it.”</p>
                        <p>If I don’t go to Dar, you will publish it as soon as possible—the middle
                            of next week—so we can be ready before the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>On Rhodesia, we will operate on the basis of the two papers you have, the
                            political and economic. In fairness we have to say the British made a
                            mistake in that Council, because it will have to be adjusted in a
                            negotiation. We showed our good faith by presenting it to you without
                            examining it carefully.</p>
                        <p>If I go to Dar, I won’t give it to the Africans but I will go to Pretoria
                            to get you to get Smith to propose it. You will get Smith to agree 99%,
                            and I will tell him, to explain our moral position—that I, who don’t
                            want to do it and who resisted doing it for seven and a half years, now

                        <p>Smith will have to put it forward anyway. In this situation, he will put

                            And we will veto sanctions.</p>
                        <p>All this is subject to my confirming by Friday the position of the
                            President. I am 90 percent certain—the only uncertainty is the
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>On Namibia, this proposal is for independence and a unitary state. If it
                            is rejected, it can only be because of the radicals and the Soviets. The
                            same on Rhodesia. We cannot be in the position of supporting the white
                            minority governments, but we can be in the position of opposing
                            violence.</p>
                        <p>In South Africa, I will say there is not a South African-U.S. program. I
                            will say I was asked by the African leaders to open contact with you; I
                            was asked to present some ideas. After two missions to Africa, I can say
                            we made considerable progress at this meeting.</p>

                            may be to you—that it appears there is a quid pro quo we gave to South
                            Africa. And in fact there is no quid pro quo; none was asked for.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I will say that if I

                            the Rhodesians. If you ignore them, they will take it amiss. Can you
                            say: “It is not impossible”?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. You can tell

                            to meet him. If they ask: “Do you absolutely rule it out?” I will say I

                        <p>If I leave any indication I will meet Smith, all hell will break loose in

                            there are programs and the question isn’t about buying people to leave

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me talk briefly on
                            Namibia. Since you attach great importance to South Africa being at the
                            Conference and South Africa attaches great importance to not being
                            there. So intellectually there are two types of problems. The problems
                            about the internal organization of Namibia—these can be taken care of by
                            a South African statement that they will accept the results of the
                            Conference. There is a second class of problems which involve South
                            Africa—withdrawal of the police, the army. I wonder if it can be
                            satisfied by having a South African representative there who can be the
                            point of contact for the first class of problems and a negotiator for
                            the second type of problems.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: It is a matter of the
                            definition of a conference. Say to the South Africans: “President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> said the conference
                            is you, <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, and the United
                            Nations.” If they say no, we rule them out. So what is this conference?
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> and the Chiefs. Who would
                            call this a Constitutional Conference? How can I call this a
                            Constitutional Conference? How can I say it to my fellow Presidents?
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is saying “Pull out your
                            troops.” And I say no, this is for negotiation. What else is there to
                            negotiate with the South Africans? They are not serious.</p>
                        <p>We ask them to be there because although legally they are not there, in
                            fact they are the colonial power. We must talk to the de facto
                            authority. If not, we will have to ask the legal authority to take over,
                            which is the United Nations. Then we have to take <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>’s position and ask them to
                            leave.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am trying to deal
                            with the internal arrangements where the South African acts as an
                            advisory person. With respect to the second class, South Africa has a
                            person there to participate—I’m trying to save face for them. They are
                            locked into this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I understand. They are
                            saying those are matters for Namibians to discuss and they accept
                            whatever is the outcome. But other matters—Walvis Bay, troops—this I
                            accept.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You accept?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Yes, I accept.</p>
                        <pb n="557" facs="0596" xml:id="pg_557"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m not certain I can
                            do it but at least to have a defined aim.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: The key is whether South
                            Africa is a participant in that conference. They are an essential
                            participant. The specific issues they discuss, and what issues they
                            leave to Namibians . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You see, I have the
                            impression it is easier for <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> to put Namibia aside so he doesn’t have a
                            decision to make every day.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Then isn’t it better to
                            leave it to <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> and the United
                            Nations? Wouldn’t <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> then insist
                            they pull out before they go? And we turn it over to Geneva.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If we can get the
                            South Africans to designate a point of contact, to maintain a figleaf,
                            is that acceptable?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: No. South Africa is the
                            real power. They should go whole hog and leave it to the United Nations
                            and <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. They can’t have it both
                            ways, and be in but not in.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But they haven’t said
                            that yet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I know.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Based on that
                            misunderstanding, I have been working on getting them to agree to move
                            the Windhoek Conference to Geneva, and invite <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss>. It was not easy to get done. But it was, with great
                            pressure. And to set a firm date for independence. They have done those
                            three things.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: How does <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> accept a conference which is not
                            clearly a conference between South Africa and the people of Namibia? I
                            know one can argue about who is in South Africa’s delegation. But South
                            Africa must be there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Supposing South Africa
                            said ahead of time it will accept whatever is decided by this group?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Then why are they in
                            there?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They can say,
                            presumably, that if the group asks them to withdraw, they will
                            withdraw.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: But that is why we are
                            doing this, because South Africa won’t get out.</p>
                        <p>This is a very difficult matter for us too, because a Constitutional
                            Conference is between the colonial power and the people of Namibia. I
                            assumed the argument would be who are the people of Namibia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would assume members
                            of the Windhoek Conference plus <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                            >SWAPO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: We would say <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> plus . . . [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Did I understand
                            correctly this morning? You said if South Africa is there, there is no
                            need for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> to be there?</p>
                        <pb n="558" facs="0597" xml:id="pg_558"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I said the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> presence could be symbolic, provided the
                            Secretary-General accepts this and comes. He can say, “I’m glad you’re
                            getting together.” And he can leave. He could leave someone there, for
                            all I care. We could agree beforehand on a neutral chairman.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Zurich, <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> would hear nothing of South
                            African participation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Then he doesn’t want to
                            settle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Germany [June
                            23–24] I had urged him to accept moving the conference to Geneva, so we
                            didn’t put great weight on it.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d196">Document 196</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: He might have said
                            no.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But I added it only
                            when I became aware of the feeling of the black Africans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: A Constitutional
                            Conference must involve the colonial power. If they don’t come, leave it
                            to the United Nations. I think they would like this less than the first.
                            It is we who should be embarrassed by this. If they are embarrassed, we
                            can say “Get out—the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> can take
                            over.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My understanding is
                            they are not participating in Windhoek right now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: No. It is my
                            misunderstanding too; I thought they were. I discovered later the South
                            Africans say they are not in there. So both of us were misled. I’m
                            sorry.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s not the point.
                            In a serious negotiation no one can mislead anybody because it will come
                            out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: We assumed all the time
                            the South Africans were there. It turns out they were not.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. I
                            understand the problem. I don’t know what I can achieve. We will have to
                            see when I come back.</p>
                        <p>Now on Rhodesia, just to clarify my thinking:</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding, when we talk about these various guarantee
                            schemes, this is not an issue in black Africa.</p>
                        <p>It is a little more complicated than buying out the whites. It is a fund
                            to put money into the economy, and also for the whites. I have got
                            confirmation from Britain, Germany, France—and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> is in Canada.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: This idea is my child! I
                            told Mr. Wilson they would only be deciding where they go.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s easier for us
                            domestically if we say it is to make them stay.</p>
                        <pb n="559" facs="0598" xml:id="pg_559"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I understand
                            completely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is better if they
                            don’t all go at once. You personally have no problem with it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: No problem whatsoever. No
                            problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The third issue is:
                            You said a <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Chissano</persName> Government
                            is all right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Yes. What I précis as a
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1">Chissano</persName> Government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That was a white High
                            Commissioner.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is instead of one
                            white governor; it’s a body that has three whites but some black
                            participation. We can leave it to the British.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I’d go easy on that one.
                            Let’s leave it to the British. What they want is a formula that restores
                                <hi rend="italic">their</hi> authority, <hi rend="italic">their</hi>
                            presence, before independence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They could do it with
                            the Governor; it makes no difference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: In Maputo, the High
                            Commissioner had his own staff and <persName corresp="#p_CJA_1"
                                >Chissano</persName> had his own staff.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And it avoids a white
                            panic.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I understand completely.
                            The British can do it how they want.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So there is a
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: During the
                            transition.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: During the transition
                            we need a white presence that gives confidence to the white community
                            and we don’t have to decide how to do it—one man, or one man with
                            advisers, or a body. The Constitutional Conference can do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: The British have lots of
                            experience with it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.</p>
                        <p>Let me see if I have any other questions. [Looks at folder and
                            checklists.]</p>
                        <p>Okay, I think that’s all the substantive issues.</p>
                        <p>Let’s decide what we say to the press. I’ll say we had good talks. I’ll
                            be asked “Was progress made?” I’ll say “This isn’t the place to make
                            progress. I came here to get ideas to take to the other side. But the
                            attitude was constructive and in this sense, the talks were useful.”</p>
                        <p>I’ll be asked if President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>
                            approves the guarantee plan. Can I say this is between the outside
                            powers and the settlers? Or can I say there is no objection?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I have no objection on my
                            part. You can say that.</p>
                        <pb n="560" facs="0599" xml:id="pg_560"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is the
                            easiest.</p>
                        <p>What are the procedures?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: It depends on whether
                            Rhodesia will accept majority rule.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: On Namibia, if we can
                            avoid going into too much detail. I can say I understand what President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> considers the
                            essential requirements, and we have to see what Pretoria considers its
                            essential requirements.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: No problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can say the United
                            States believes <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> has to be
                            represented.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: No one will ask me about
                            the presence of South Africa because the press assumes they will be
                            there. If they ask me, I’ll say so. But I think I’m going to be quite
                            safe.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To follow you is no
                            easy task. You’re a master!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: If I have no answer, I
                            just smile. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Muganda: You said you wanted our press to ask a question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: About <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> participation. I’ll say our
                            position is it should include all significant groups and <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is one. I can’t say now that
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is the only one. But you
                            can.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I will. But I really
                            won’t. Because I don’t want to prejudice the South Africans’
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Muganda: What excuse does <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            give for not talking with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Because he thinks they
                            are a bunch of gangsters. [Laughter] But he says there was a time when
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> didn’t want to talk to
                            him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: But they changed! South
                            Africa will change.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The question is
                            whether we can organize the conference before South Africa changes.
                            Because I think once the conference begins, world public opinion will be
                            on the side of <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. The outcome is
                            inevitable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So I see the convening
                            of the assembly as the decisive step.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I take your point. I
                            agree.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Because South Africa
                            probably won’t agree right away. South Africa will say it is Windhoek
                            plus <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. You will say it is <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> plus Windhoek. But reality will
                            take over. Why should Namibia be the only state in Africa organized by
                            tribes and not by national movements? The U.S. has no interest. This,
                            incidentally, is a better as<pb n="561" facs="0600" xml:id="pg_561"
                            />surance than anything I can give. Because a new Secretary of State
                            could change his mind.</p>
                        <p>In Zurich he said no, he wouldn’t come in any capacity, so it may be
                            theoretical. In Zurich, he said he wouldn’t pay for the conference. That
                            is what he said.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: The United Nations can
                            pay for it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I told him not to
                            worry about it; someone would pay. Maybe Nelson Rockefeller would pay
                            for it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: Or Lonrho. The uranium
                            companies.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Who gets the
                            uranium?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: The British and the
                            Germans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_GEV_1">Giscard</persName> said: When you ask Schmidt, he
                            will say Provision 114 (b) of the Constitution prohibits it. I asked
                            Schmidt. He said “Provision 114 (b) of our Constitution prohibits it.” I
                            asked him about Namibia, and he said that there it was possible.</p>
                        <p>I’ll tell <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> on the 22nd. He
                            told me he would come back. Can you be there?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I’ll talk to him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Probably <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> will agree to all your
                                points—<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> participation, <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> participation, South African
                            participation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: South Africa is the
                            colonial power. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> can be
                            symbolic.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I appreciate my talks
                            with you, Mr. President.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I hope you will get these
                            two conferences going.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I received a message
                            from President Asad: He thinks the South Africans must be advising the
                            Lebanese because they are so stubborn. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>: I wish you luck.</p>
                        <p>I’ll see the press.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Rhodesia, there is
                            one issue: Will Smith agree? If he doesn’t, we fail. In Namibia, the
                            issues are more complicated. We will know when I come back.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I want to thank you,
                            Mr. President, for a truly warm welcome and your gracious words. The
                            general atmosphere which you have set is particularly helpful after the
                            events of yesterday in Tanzania. You know that the press has reported
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> is hostile to
                            our undertaking. Press reports of that sort encourage all of the wrong
                            forces in the United States. You will recall after my speech in Lusaka
                            all hell broke loose in the southern states. I really appreciate the
                            friendly reception. Mr. President, this entire initiative started here
                            in Lusaka. It was based, in fact, on your visit to the United States
                            when you brought to our attention the problems of your region.<note

                            courageous efforts to achieve peace. We are now learning how difficult
                            peace can be. We are beginning to understand the cast of characters with
                            which you are so familiar. Your advice and assistance has been
                            invaluable. Which of the two problems we need to discuss would you like

                            With regard to Zimbabwe, it is my observation that the procedure is
                            quite easy, but substantively the problem is difficult. If the Salisbury
                            authorities accept majority rule, we can organize a conference which
                            will work out the steps leading to in<pb n="563" facs="0602"
                                xml:id="pg_563"/>dependence. In Namibia, there are procedural
                            problems, but the substance is rather less difficult.</p>
                        <p>I have made clear to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> that
                            if he wants African nations to accept his country, he must separate
                            himself from Rhodesia. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            must show cooperation and make concrete steps which will bring Rhodesia
                            to majority rule. He has not fully committed himself and has only said
                            he wanted to talk to Smith. In general, he has made a commitment to
                            majority rule but has not given us a final word on how that will be
                            accomplished. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> knows that
                            if I go to Pretoria, I must have results. He has to choose between
                            taking those steps which will lead to a settlement of the Rhodesian
                            problem or letting the situation deteriorate. If he decides to pursue a
                            positive course, we can move forward. You know <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>’s proposal for a constitutional
                            conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: No, he has not worked that

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Basically, he suggests
                            that Britain call a constitutional conference which would include the
                            black nationalists as well as those members of the Salisbury regime
                            prepared to work out an arrangement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: At which stage would such
                            a conference be called?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName

                            constitutional conference should take place before our initiative has
                            produced results, there could be endless delays. When he wrote the
                            British, he suggested that a constitutional conference could be called
                            before or after majority rule is an accepted fact. I believe that the
                            white Rhodesians should accept the principle of majority rule first and
                            then a constitutional conference could be held. Do you agree with this
                            approach?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I did not know about it
                            earlier, but I am not opposed to the idea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will not know until
                            next week if it is possible to persuade the white Rhodesians to accept
                            majority rule. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> has
                            suggested that I meet Smith. If you hear that I have met Smith, you can
                            be optimistic about the chance of reaching a settlement. I will only
                            meet him if I have assurance that there will be majority rule in two
                            years. Otherwise, there will be no meeting. Perhaps Smith will resign
                            which is another possibility.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Let me warn you to be most
                            careful with Smith. He is slippery and extremely dangerous. If you
                            should meet him and nothing happens, it would be very bad.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I meet him and
                            nothing happens, we will attack him publicly. I have no intention to
                            meet him for general conversation or a <pb n="564" facs="0603"
                                xml:id="pg_564"/>general review of the conditions of a settlement. I
                            have told <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> that I will
                            only meet Smith on condition that Smith is prepared to make a
                            commitment. Will I be able to reach you here in Lusaka?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: No, I will be away at my
                            party meetings, but you can always contact me through my colleagues
                            here.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s too bad I can’t
                            be here. You know how much I like to come to your party congresses.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Please be careful with
                            Smith. If you meet him and do not get a commitment, the man will emerge
                            in Rhodesia even stronger politically.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no firm plan to
                            meet him now. If <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> tells
                            me that Smith accepts our program in its entirety and all Smith needs is
                            to tell his own people the Americans—in addition to the South
                            Africans—demand he comply with the program, then I will meet him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I hope you can rely on
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s assurance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Mark Chona</persName> met Smith at South
                            African urging and nothing happened. There must be no question of
                            recognizing him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Recognizing him?
                            That’s out of the question. The only purpose of my meeting with Smith
                            would be to facilitate a transfer of power. The announcement of that
                            transfer would have to come in a short period—say two weeks. I will not
                            explore possibilities with him or engage in general discussion. Either
                            he agrees to accept majority rule or I won’t meet him.</p>
                        <p>Smith must accept basic principles—a commitment to majority rule in two
                            years, a provisional government which has a black prime minister and a
                            black-dominated cabinet with only a few white members—then we can
                            talk.</p>
                        <p>In this regard I can foresee a government structure during the period of
                            transition which would include a Council of State. The Council would
                            serve the same capacity as a governor or a high commissioner would in
                            colonial territories. In Rhodesia the Council would have more whites
                            than blacks. The Council would disappear with full independence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: How long would that
                            take?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: From 18 months to 2
                            years. The United Kingdom, perhaps the United States and maybe the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> ought to guarantee the
                            execution of the program. Let me reassure you the Council of State would
                            have the same functions as a high commissioner or a governor general.
                            Administrative authority and executive control would be in the hands of
                            a cabinet which will have a black prime minister.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I am concerned by the
                            powers of the Council of State. If the Council of State controls the
                            armed forces, the police and the civil service, it may not be possible
                            for the guaranteeing powers to keep the <pb n="565" facs="0604"
                                xml:id="pg_565"/>Council under control. After all, the guaranteeing
                            powers are outsiders and far away. Their very distance could lead to a
                            dangerous situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How do you think we
                            should proceed? I have an open mind.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: If you have United States,
                            British and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> guarantees, how could
                            we be sure that these guarantees would be effective?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If the Council of
                            State ever violated its authority, we would demand that South Africa
                            apply total sanctions. South Africa can bring Rhodesia to heel in a
                            matter of weeks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: What would happen if South
                            Africa refused to cooperate?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would have to
                            consider sanctions against South Africa. The situation really is quite
                            different from that which existed when you tried to negotiate a
                            settlement for Zimbabwe. You were most courageous and took a chance. We
                            have real leverage and can bring it to bear.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: You must understand me,
                            Mr. Secretary of State. I am trying to think of all possibilities. If
                            the conditions were presented the way you described them, we must be
                            sure we have looked for all the flaws. Interfering in another nation’s
                            internal situation is difficult. We would not interfere in your
                            country’s internal affairs. Moreover, what if all of us accepted your
                            scheme and President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> lost
                            the election?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I wish you could give
                            us technical advice on how to run an election campaign. A few of your
                            party workers would be most effective. I understand you, however.</p>
                        <p>What I am going to tell you I will not say in the larger meeting. I have
                            been in touch with Governor Carter via Dean Rusk. Carter has let me know
                            that he supports my undertaking on the condition that the African
                            Presidents support it. Of course, he cannot say this publicly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSG_1">Mwale</persName>: This is tricky.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What would you
                            recommend?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSG_1">Mwale</persName>: Coming back to the
                            President’s point. If <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> is
                            elected, that’s fine. But another President may have his own advisers
                            and his own policies. They may be more radical.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Or the other way
                            around.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t see the
                            practical difference. If white Rhodesians agree to majority rule, what
                            difference would it make who is in office in the United States?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSG_1">Mwale</persName>: Mr. Secretary of State,
                            that depends when majority rule comes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s say in two
                            years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSG_1">Mwale</persName>: It really depends on how
                            the liberation movements see it.</p>
                        <pb n="566" facs="0605" xml:id="pg_566"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would they accept a
                            proposal like the one I have described, Mr. President?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Given their past
                            experience, the program you propose would have to be very tight. This is
                            why we must continue to fight and at the same time support the
                            liberation struggle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We haven’t asked you
                            to stop your support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: What I am trying to say is
                            that the liberation movements must have a very tight offer. Otherwise,
                            if they stop fighting and are betrayed, there will be no end of
                            difficulty. The United States Government is making the third, or is it
                            the fourth, try at securing majority rule in Rhodesia. All previous
                            efforts have failed. Before we try to put pressure on the liberation
                            movements, we must have a solid guarantee of success.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our idea is quite
                            simple and it springs from the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"

                            which you have criticized. We are simply not prepared to set out such a
                            bold plan if we were ready to see it violated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> asked me whether we were
                            ready to support the freedom fighters if the current process of
                            negotiations broke down. In the abstract, we can’t give an answer to
                            that question. If the understanding was violated, our word would be
                            called into question.</p>
                        <p>You realize that the issue is not a political one at home. I briefed 47
                            senators—some Republicans and many more Democrats—and I got their full
                            backing. I even obtained the support of Southern Democrats. Look . . . I
                            am prepared to consider other guarantees. Do you have any to
                            suggest?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Not for the moment. But
                            let’s turn to Namibia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good. In June before
                            my first meeting with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> in
                            Germany, <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> sent me a letter
                            in which he said that the Africans wanted two things. First, a transfer
                            of the Windhoek conference to Lusaka and, second, the inclusion of
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. I put these two points to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>. He did not agree.
                            Under additional pressure, he concurred in the conference moving to
                            Geneva. I will have to reconfirm these points when I visit Pretoria.
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is not exactly his favorite
                            institution, but he has now come around to agreeing that <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> should participate. Then we
                            obtained a firm date for independence. In addition, based on <pb n="567"
                                facs="0606" xml:id="pg_567"/>your last letter,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d205fn5"><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>’s
                                letter was transmitted in telegram 2277 from Lusaka, September 3.
                                (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1">RG</gloss> 59, Central
                                Foreign Policy Files, P840083–0072)</note> we succeeded in
                            convincing the South Africans to take into consideration the problems of
                            their own relationship to the Geneva talks, the political prisoner
                            issue, United Nations responsibilities, military forces, and so forth.
                            These are extra considerations, many of which can be settled in Geneva.
                            There are three basic points and your objectives in each of the three
                            cases have already been realized. First, there is a date; second, a
                            mechanism; and third, <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is
                            participating.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is in a good
                            position. It enjoys international recognition. Both the United Nations
                            and the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> have made that point clear.
                            Since it has international backing, <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss>’s position at the Constitutional Conference will be
                            strong. There is no other Namibian group which has the support of the
                            African states. Must every condition be met before the Conference begins
                            or can we negotiate the other points?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: What is the date for
                            Namibia independence you mentioned?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: December 1978.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: Isn’t that the date that
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> has rejected?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Even if <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> fights, they can’t possibly
                            achieve independence before 1978. They simply do not have the means.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: Is it possible to advance
                            that date?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is only with the
                            greatest difficulty I obtained a date. Last June I thought I would get
                            nothing. I have succeeded in including <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> in the process. We have a date and the Conference may
                            take place in Geneva. How many more conditions must I negotiate before
                            the Conference can begin?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: First, a correction on
                            what happened. When William Rogers and <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >William Schaufele</persName> came here, I told them that I had
                            reviewed the question with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> and
                            that <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> felt there were additional
                            features which they required.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: At the time it was not
                            clear that Geneva was in play.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, no. I agree you
                            have added no new conditions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: What would be the level of
                            South African participation?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am glad you raised
                            this because I wanted to discuss it. Frankly, this is a difficult
                            question to answer. I am not sure South Africa is prepared to send a
                            representative.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: What you say cuts two
                            ways. Suppose <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> joins conference
                            in Geneva. What assurance do we have that South Africa will accept the
                            results of the conference?</p>
                        <pb n="568" facs="0607" xml:id="pg_568"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Either South Africa
                            attends the Conference or it agrees in advance that all conclusions of
                            the Conference will be accepted. In my view—I must emphasize not in the
                            South African view—South Africa will have to be present to negotiate or
                            it will have to agree to the decisions of the conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: This would make the whole
                            process a lot easier. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            maintains that Namibia is an internal affair.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose I got
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> to write me a letter
                            in which he obligates himself to accept the results of the
                            Constitutional Conference?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: That’s interesting. I must
                            make clear, though, that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> has to
                            have authority.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We agree with you. I
                            have said that repeatedly in my speeches. I intend to approach the South
                            Africans saying that the conference should take place in Geneva. If they
                            agree I will offer them two alternatives. On the one hand they can
                            participate directly or the South Africans can agree to accept the
                            results of the conference. It would be one or the other, in my view and
                            I would be prepared to support either outcome.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: It would be most
                            unfortunate if the conference met, came to a decision and then the South
                            Africans rejected the decisions and demanded renegotiation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. We have to
                            take up the three basic conditions of a settlement with <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>. We will also discuss the
                            political prisoner question. As to the issue of a South African
                            association, I am prepared to recommend one solution or the other but we
                            will not support a constitutional conference if two years later the
                            South Africans refuse to accept the results of the conference. That
                            outcome would not be acceptable from our point of view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: What about a relationship
                            with the United Nations?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well . . . you know
                            how the South Africans regard the United Nations. How important would it
                            be to have a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> connection?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: It seems to me that the
                            United Nations must be associated. The world community has agreed that
                            Namibia is a United Nations’ responsibility. The <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> cannot be left out. You, like we, are members of the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If you think it is
                            important, I will try to negotiate it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Yes, I believe it is
                            important. The United States should also be present at the Geneva
                            conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No. No . . . I hear
                            there is a tribe in Namibia called the Bastards. We can supply from the
                            United States several tribes to join them. The United States can give
                            advice and it can even help in the event of a deadlock. But if we attend
                            the Soviet Union would also want to be there.</p>
                        <pb n="569" facs="0608" xml:id="pg_569"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I understand. However,
                            there must be some guarantee against breakdown.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Conceivably we could
                            write you a letter spelling out the conditions or we could write a
                            letter to all the front line presidents. Not to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName>, of course, but to the others. In
                            the letter we would state our views of the understanding. Alternatively,
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> could write us a
                            letter and we could transmit it to you. How do you believe we should
                            proceed?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I am not sure. I would
                            like to think about that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I am not sure who
                            would call the constitutional conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: You could call it.</p>
                        <p>Mwali: Namibia is coming up for debate in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is not certain that
                            the question will be fully settled by then. Maybe you have a point. The
                            Security Council could issue a resolution calling for the conference. It
                            is also possible the United Nations could offer its facilities without
                            actually taking charge of the conference.</p>
                        <p>Mwali: Yes, but this would be difficult. In the case of Namibia the
                            United Nations has recognized authority. The Council of Namibia . .

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: The United Nations
                            could provide facilities. But the Foreign Minister’s question is of a
                            different nature. The United Nations cannot step in and replace the
                            Namibians who must determine themselves how to organize an independent
                            government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is going to be a
                            big step for South Africa to agree to shift the conference from Windhoek
                            to Geneva and include <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> plus Geneva plus some sort of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> relationship is a lot to expect.
                            I think it would be desirable to convene the conference quickly. That is
                            the most rapid path to independence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> has leaders under sentence of death in South
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They have? Please give
                            me a list of their names. I will ask <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> that the sentences not be carried out. If you
                            don’t have the <pb n="570" facs="0609" xml:id="pg_570"/>names, it is not
                            important. The South Africans probably know them. We have already
                            mentioned the prisoner issue to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> but it would be helpful if you could give us a
                            list. There is one the South Africans don’t want to release.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Who is that?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Herman Toyvo Ya
                            Toyvo.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Who is he?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: He is quite important to
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. For that reason he may
                            also be important to the South Africans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: There is another point I
                            would like to make. We have gone along with you and have accepted most
                            of the conditions which will result in the opening of a conference. But
                            if South Africa is not there that will be difficult. Moreover, your
                            approach and that of President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> will run into difficulties if the death
                            sentences are carried out before the conference is convened.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t have the
                            names. You must tell me what you want. If I understand you, we need to
                            get prisoners released and the death sentences lifted. Concerning the
                            conference itself, you also want a <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            relationship. You also wish to have South African participation. I am
                            prepared to back either South African participation or an agreement that
                            South Africa will accept the conclusions of the conference.</p>
                        <p>You also want <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> to be included. We
                            agree with you and I have said so publicly. Indeed, I am prepared to
                            meet with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> leaders. Are those
                            the principals involved? Is that a fair summary?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Yes it is. The troop
                            withdrawal issue can be part of the Geneva conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think the
                            United States should take part in the Geneva conference but we could
                            write you our understanding of the conditions. Alternatively, we could
                            ask <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> to write you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: It would be better if
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> wrote you and you
                            sent us the letter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We could give his
                            letter of understanding to you or to <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName>. I may not be able to achieve everything you
                            ask. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> is in a difficult
                            position, but I will raise these subjects with him when we meet in
                            Pretoria. When I return here I hope to have more concrete results. I
                            plan to arrive in Lusaka on Sunday night or Monday morning.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d205fn6">September 19 or 20.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: We all know <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s dislike of the United
                            Nations. Let’s accept that. There is even an advantage in their
                            position. Why not let the Namibians go to Geneva and whatever happens in
                            Geneva would be the responsibility of the United Nations. In that
                            fashion South Africa <pb n="571" facs="0610" xml:id="pg_571"/>would not
                            have to associate itself with the Geneva discussions. <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> participation will lend the conclusions
                            respectability.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have learned since I
                            began dealing with Africa that the most logical approach is not always
                            the most successful. What Mark says is reasonable. Since the South
                            African Government won’t go to Geneva, why not let the United Nations
                            take charge.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: Why was Geneva
                            selected?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I suggested Geneva
                            since there is no other place outside of New York where the United
                            Nations has an equivalent presence.</p>
                        <p>These are the principal items. How do we go forward? When I return from
                            Pretoria, I will know what is possible in Rhodesia. If nothing is
                            possible, then we have a problem. We should discuss future steps. If, on
                            the other hand, I obtain satisfaction in Pretoria, the United Kingdom
                            could call a constitutional conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Yes. I go along with that
                            approach.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your view
                            about the Nationalist movements?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Essentially the problem
                            lies in their disunity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I remember vividly
                            what you told President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and
                            me about factionalization. You were talking about Angola. Remember, you
                            referred to <persName corresp="#p_SJ_2">Jonas Savimbi</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: If you are successful in
                            Pretoria that will help us unify the nationalists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We will accept
                            whatever advice the front line Presidents give us about dealing with the
                            nationalists. We will be influenced by your decision.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I hope you meet with
                            success but really I don’t know.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When I got involved in
                            the dispute between Israel and Syria I said that I would never be so
                            involved again. But look, here I am and we have the same sorts of
                            intractable problems. If you sit in Washington and look at the situation
                            here the basic principles are clear but in their application the process
                            becomes complicated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I really appreciate your
                            policy. It is an important breakthrough for Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Would you be willing
                            to meet our press? It would be very useful. If you could mention the
                            thought you just had—our undertaking is in Africa’s interest . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: All right . . . I agree .
                            . . We will do it here at State House. I may also use <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s own words. Do you remember
                            that he said, “The alternative to success is too ghastly to
                            contemplate”?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If there is no
                            settlement, what will happen?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: The liberation struggle
                            will go on and we will give it our full support.</p>
                        <pb n="572" facs="0611" xml:id="pg_572"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me be clear. We
                            are asking for nothing from you until a provisional government is
                            formed. We are not asking you to stop your support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: As I warned you when we
                            met in Washington, we have had to turn to the Soviet Union and China for
                            arms. This was essential. Our boys could not fight without arms. You are
                            kind to remember what I said during my visit to your country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have had many
                            visitors visit Washington since you came but I remember your visit
                            particularly. You predicted the future and few are able to do that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: I can’t take much credit
                            for my vision. We live here and must know how to analyze our situation.
                            The evolution has been painful and the future will be worse. Your
                            bombing of Southeast Asia—we criticized you—one doesn’t know if the
                            destruction won’t be worse here.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You don’t mean
                            American bombing here?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: No. I mean the general
                            destruction in the area could be worse than what happened in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I greatly appreciated
                            your courtesies to my wife. You know I visited Victoria Falls during my
                            last stay but the boat I was on almost went over the Falls. I would have
                            never given my speech. Victoria Falls was one of the most awe-inspiring
                            sights of my life.</p>
                        <p>(Tea is served.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I could make a
                            personal observation. There have been special moments in my life. One
                            was the first time I shook hands with Chou En Lai. Another was when you
                            stood up after my speech in Lusaka. This gesture came so much from the
                            heart. You could not have planned it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: That was indeed a special
                            moment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Were the same trees in
                            flower when I was here in April?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: No. These come out during
                            the dry season.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They are perfectly
                            lovely. If we get the two conferences underway, I will only have to
                            visit you on ceremonial occasions . . . or attend your party congresses.
                            We should have asked your advice before our primaries. Does your party
                            meet every year?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: The seminars for top
                            leaders which are presently in progress are the first since
                            independence. These seminars last three to four days and in addition to
                            senior party leaders they include representatives of state and private
                            enterprise.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do they talk about
                            Zambia?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: Yes, primarily about
                            developments since independence. I have had to spend two and a half

                            opportunity to find out what people have on their minds. I love the sky
                            here. The difference between Lusaka and Dar es Salaam is striking. Here
                            the air is so clear.</p>
                        <p>Let me ask you a procedural question. If I came here on Monday and then
                            went to Dar—I have to be back in the United States on the 24th. You know
                            we are the “host” country for the United Nations. Foreign Ministers from
                            all over the world visit. If I am not there we will have problems. What
                            is your thought? Will you require consultations with the other
                            Presidents before or after I leave Africa? After I see you on Sunday or
                            Monday I will visit <persName corresp="#p_MSS_1">Mobutu</persName>. I
                            could come back here on the 22nd. You said you might be in Lusaka if
                            that proved to be necessary. Let me leave it up to you to consult with
                            the other Presidents. If you think you should seek the opinions of the
                            Nationalist leaders, that too would be all right. You could bring them
                            here and I would be happy to meet them separately or together. We will
                            take no initiative but you think about it. I will wait for your
                            signal.</p>
                        <p>What should I discuss in the larger meeting which you have called? You
                            should take the lead.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: All right.</p>

                            detail do you want to get into? I prefer to let you take the lead and I
                            will reply.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>: The press will be there for
                            the preliminary remarks. Once those are over they will leave.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>: We will not begin our

                                was held at the Prime Minister’s residence, 5:55–8:46 p.m. Memoranda

                            accepted our proposals. They have agreed to:</p>
                        <p>—Majority rule within two years (i.e., the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> plan);</p>
                        <p>—Immediate negotiations with black representatives to create an interim
                            government for the two-year transition;</p>
                        <p>—A structure for the interim government that shares power, giving blacks
                            a majority of the Cabinet but giving whites the safeguard of a 50–50
                            split on a key executive body, the Council of State. The Council of
                            State will supervise the drafting of the new constitution.</p>
                        <p>—The British Parliment will enact enabling legislation, reasserting their
                            authority, and the Rhodesians will then pass necessary legislation
                            effecting the changes.</p>
                        <p>—The Rhodesians will insist that when the interim government is formed,
                                <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> sanctions and guerrilla warfare
                            will end. The US and <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> will support
                            this position diplomatically.</p>
                        <p>3. Smith is returning to Salisbury, to push this through his Cabinet on
                                Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">September 21.</note> and his
                            party caucus on Wednesday and Thursday. If all goes well, he pledged to
                            me to announce the program, as a Rhodesian offer to the blacks, in a
                            radio-television speech on Friday.</p>
                        <p>4. In the meantime, I will show it to the blacks and insist upon their
                            acceptance. The delicacy of the next phase makes it vital that we
                            prevent leaks until it is finished. If it comes out in an uncontrolled
                            way, we could be beaten to death, particularly by the radicals and
                            Soviets who now have definite interest in derailing it.</p>
                        <p>5. The Rhodesians have also accepted in outline the economic guarantee
                            scheme drawn up by us and the British. This is now for negotiation with
                            the blacks, but the blacks have all told us they have no objection to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>6. Smith and <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> are fully
                            aware of the disastrous consequences—to them above all—if Smith fails to
                            fulfill his commitment. The international pressures will become
                            massive—on both of them—and the United States, appearing to have been
                            double-crossed, will <pb n="575" facs="0614" xml:id="pg_575"/>have no
                            choice but to join the pressures or at best let nature take its course,
                            as they are both engulfed by widening violence.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> understands this
                            completely, and I must say both he and Smith have behaved honorably with
                            me thus far. Smith and his colleagues asked many questions, groped for
                            alternatives, but came around inevitably to understand the necessity of
                            what we proposed. Smith, too, wants a rapid solution (A) which boosts
                            the chances for moderates like <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nkomo</persName> to take charge of the black government, and (B)
                            which insures conditions that will give the 270,000 whites decent future
                            and incentive to stay. He and his colleagues acted with dignity and
                            intelligence—contrary to all the predictions given to me.</p>
                        <p>8. This outcome gives me no pleasure. It is extremely painful for me to
                            be the instrument of their fate—which could turn out to be disastrous.
                            That they have accepted with good grace only makes it harder. I believe
                            we must do all we can to see it through with care and make it work, for
                            the sake of both communities.</p>
                        <p>9. After my seven hours with Smith (four hours in mid-morning and three
                            hours in the afternoon), I spent two hours with <persName

                            obtained from the South Africans what I would think is enough to
                            conclude this issue too. A Geneva conference including <gloss

                            off the international agenda. But this is Africa, and one can never

                            three-hour private meeting the Rhodesia program that Smith had
                            accepted—the five points I reported to you yesterday, for majority rule
                            in two years and an immediate provisional government. I told him this is
                            what they had been seeking for eleven years and now was the time to
                            move.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> was speechless, and I
                            think it took him a while to absorb what I was saying. After a long
                            pause, the first question he asked was what guarantee we had that this
                            would be carried out. I told him that Smith could have no illusion about
                            what it would mean to doublecross the U.S. and South Africa. He brought
                            some of his ministerial and party colleagues into the room and I went
                            over it again.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> expressed gratitude. As
                            I expected, he said that of course he would have to consult his fellow
                            presidents. He sent three of his closest advisers to make an immediate
                            tour of neighboring capitals. We agreed that after I saw <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> on Tuesday, I would come back
                            to either Dar or Lusaka to talk with them again.</p>
                        <p>6. Then I went over the Namibia concessions I had obtained from <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>—moving the Windhoek conference
                            to Geneva, inviting <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> to
                            participate, allowing <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> involvement,
                            and pledging South Africa to accept the results. On this <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> was even more positive. He
                            expressed satisfaction and believed this procedure would succeed. “We
                            can see light here.” If we could arrange that <persName
                                corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> would simultaneously call a
                            Geneva conference, so the blacks could call it a new conference, <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> would probably go along. <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is based in Lusaka, so <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> is attuned to <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>’s thinking.</p>
                        <p>7. I came back for a small dinner with the President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>. We went over the Pretoria
                            meetings, the opportunity presented to Africa if Smith indeed announces
                            on Friday his support for the plan, and the <pb n="577" facs="0616"
                                xml:id="pg_577"/>need for strong support from the African presidents
                            for the peace initiative in that event. He gives every appearance of
                            having decided to push it, and is turning his attention most seriously
                            now to lining up his fellow heads of state. Evidently he shares my sense
                            that <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> is the question
                            mark; if he will go along, the others will, too.</p>
                        <p>8. I will be in Dar es Salaam today, and we will know the answer.<note

                                concerns with arrangements for both conferences, and argued that (a)
                                the British should convene a constitutional conference for Rhodesia
                                before choosing an interim government and (b) the Namibian
                                constitutional conference could not be an extension of the Windhoek
                                conference. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> was
                                adamant that conference participants include South Africa (the de

                            fresh after your trip. I don’t know how you do it. I do thank you very

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I told Tony it was a
                            combination of arrogance and ignorance that got me into this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: No, it is because you
                            saw the necessity. I told Elwyn it was a fateful meeting. He said, yes,
                            I have seen it before, on the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> and the <hi

                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Tony, how do you think we should proceed?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I think we should ask
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> to sum it up, and
                            to tell us what role he sees for Britain in the weeks ahead.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are familiar with
                            my talks with Smith. All we have heard indicates he will put forward the
                            five points that I put to him.</p>
                        <p>I told him he had three choices: acept the five points as I put them to
                            him; put forward new ones—in which case he would be on his own; or to
                            reject them—in which case he would also be on his own. The one thing he
                            could not do was accept them in principle and then haggle.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> and our Ambassadors there
                            tell us he is in fact putting them forward.</p>
                        <p>He will also say that studies are going forward on the economic side—not
                            sums, because there are none, but the categories.</p>
                        <p>Assuming he does this . . . I have briefed <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> about this, and about the two white ministers.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> made mild noises for
                            about two minutes; <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>
                            listened and said “Fine, we have a basis for a conference.”</p>
                        <pb n="579" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_579"/>
                        <p>Now, there are differences between <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>
                            wants the scheme we have worked on, an interim government that then
                            draws up a constitution. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>
                            seems to think the five points are the basis for a Constitutional
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>My fear is this will play into the hands of both Smith and the radicals.
                            Because one of the things Smith suggested was—for which we told him he
                            was on his own—was just to call a conference, without any of the
                            safeguards of this Constitutional Conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Your approach is the
                            right one. Smith should sit down with them and set up an interim
                            government. They then should get on with a constitution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Everyone there
                            agreed—indeed volunteered—that the British had to be there in some form.
                            Even <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Kenyatta</persName>. They all agreed
                            there had to be a British role—to answer your question, Tony.</p>
                        <p>The British role is to provide the intellectual and legal framework for
                            the negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> said
                            that when Smith speaks, <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Jim

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Would Smith himself,
                            having made his declaration, call the Africans in to discuss the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think they
                            will come to a conference he calls. This is where you may have to play a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: But <persName

                            coach six months ago; earlier he met with <persName corresp="#p_GE_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName

                            you immediately after Smith speaks—about a constitutional conference.
                            All the blacks asked us. First, we have no legal responsibility; second,
                            the constitutional forms in which this is couched are foreign to us. For
                            an American diplomat to be doing it would be strange.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: You are doing all

                            You have a legal responsibility to create a framework for an interim

                        <p>There are differences among the black Presidents regarding where it

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> prefer to have it in
                            Livingstone. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> wants a
                            Constitutional Conference in London.</p>
                        <p>I told him I tried it on Smith and it is inconceivable Smith would go to
                            London. He said, “Then any other place they agree on.”</p>
                        <pb n="580" facs="0619" xml:id="pg_580"/>
                        <p>There seems to be some jockeying among the nationalist groups.</p>
                        <p>I think if you called <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>, or just <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>, and told him it is up to
                            them—not you—to field a black team and that when they notify you of the
                            team, you could supply a diplomat to facilitate the negotiations. This
                            is the most helpful thing you could do. Otherwise, there will be a host
                            of black rivalries and super power problems.</p>
                        <p>We would back you up.</p>
                        <p>This is what is needed, as soon as possible after Smith speaks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I see no reason for us
                            to be far apart on this. There is no reason for us to be involved with a
                            Governor or whatever. They don’t want it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no
                            disagreement.</p>
                        <p>Smith tried with me the idea that they just go back to the 1961
                            Constitution. I said: “You can try it on the British, but the British
                            would just get rid of it and you could be back in the same
                            position.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We could send out a
                            British diplomat once there is a black negotiating team. [To <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: I said we would be
                            prepared to play a helpful role. You see it as a two-stage thing? You
                            think, once the blacks field a team and Smith fields his team, then we
                            say “you get together and form your government.” Then when the second
                            stage is completed, there is a formal Constitutional Conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is what I think
                            would work effectively.</p>
                        <p>I think the radicals want to prolong the process; the moderates want a
                            conclusion fairly rapidly. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> can be brought to that point.</p>
                        <p>They want you in as soon as possible after Smith speaks because that
                            marks the formal end to Rhodesia’s independence, and it’s the way all of
                            them achieved formal independence.</p>
                        <p>You could call <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and say you are ready
                            to facilitate the process and they should tell you who are the black
                            negotiators. You could then call a conference for wherever they can
                            agree on.</p>
                        <p>It is not reticence on our part. We will help you wherever we can. But if
                            the United States starts putting it together, it has a completely
                            different cast in African eyes, in Soviet eyes. It is perfectly natural
                            for the British to do it. You have done it in several places. All the
                            Africans take it for granted.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: It is important that
                            you say you will put full weight behind it.</p>
                        <pb n="581" facs="0620" xml:id="pg_581"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can count on
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: We have some
                            skepticism, perhaps because, as you say, we are prejudiced.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: With respect to the
                            Europeans [in Rhodesia], we will use the mechanism of <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> and hold him responsible for
                            European performance. We have been fairly brutal with him. We can also
                            work with the blacks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: You can work with
                            Kenneth and also <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But it is a lot easier
                            for them to work with the British, and it avoids problems. Because for
                            us to get actively involved would work against all our theories that
                            superpowers shouldn’t be in Africa. It’s not an attempt to evade.</p>
                        <p>As we discussed, the objective should be to create as close to a Kenya
                            situation as possible. You are in the best position to do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: I hope to speak with
                            you in all candor. Henry. In our Cabinet, there is marked reluctance to
                            get involved, because we have been caught before. For us, the Rhodesian
                            problem is a debt of honor. There is no interest for us except to settle
                            the issue.</p>
                        <p>You can imagine, in our present economic situation and lots of other
                            problems, there is no great rush in the Cabinet to get into the process
                            again. The great difference now is Smith will have made a declaration,
                            and you will be willing to help. On that basis I will be glad to
                            recommend to the Cabinet to go along.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There is no
                            overwhelming demand in America either. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>I told Tony that after my Lusaka speech, I received 1,800 letters, of
                            which only 23 were favorable. Then I gave my Philadelphia speech and the
                            favorable letters went up to 30%.</p>
                        <p>We did this because we foresaw an increasing prospect of foreign
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>Callahan: This is where we started.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Callahan: May I ask about the guerrillas? Last time, they called it off,
                            and they complain that Smith took advantage of it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have not asked them
                            to call off anything until an interim government is formed. They have
                            not agreed to call off anything. Once there is a black Prime Minister,
                            the whites—even the white Ministers—have no white structure to defend.
                            There is nothing Smith can take advantage of.</p>
                        <p>When I talked to Smith, he understood that their interest is in rapid
                            creation of a moderate government.</p>
                        <pb n="582" facs="0621" xml:id="pg_582"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: The moment to ask
                            formally that the guerrilla war be called off is when the interim
                            government is formed. It would be an irritant certainly if whites were
                            being killed on the TV screens. So some de-escalation perhaps.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We—and you—were asked
                            by the Rhodesians. But we should work together on this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: There are reports that
                            Smith asked for more than two years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He asked, but we
                            rejected it. When the press asked, I didn’t answer. So they concluded .
                            . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: The Africans never

                            raised was about the two ministries. But <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nkomo</persName> rather liked the idea that a black Prime Minister
                            would have these resources at his disposal. He didn’t object on moral
                            grounds but on how he could sell <persName corresp="#p_MS_2"
                                >Machel</persName> on these aspects.</p>

                        <p>Until I saw today his Vice President said something in Lusaka.</p>

                        <p>Does it start from Smith’s speech, or when an interim government is
                            formed?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: A good question. I
                            haven’t thought about it. One could make a good case either way. An
                            interim government might be set up in four to six weeks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have the impression
                            Smith’s ministers want to do it fast.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: Because the war ends.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And sanctions are
                            lifted.</p>
                        <p>Elwyn-Jones: You see the setting up of an interim government is the key
                            moment. When Smith was on <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Fearless</hi>, he talked about a Constitutional
                            Conference but absolutely refused to deal with the active fact of
                            talking with the Africans. So I notice in your five statements, the
                            initial point—which I very much agree with—is the active participation,
                            indeed the initiative, of the black Africans.</p>
                        <pb n="583" facs="0622" xml:id="pg_583"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The moment when it
                            becomes irreversible is when an interim government is formed. The
                            constitution is suspended and the white structure is dismantled.</p>
                        <p>My worry about a protracted negotiation on a Constitutional Conference
                            before an interim government is that it plays into the hands of both
                            Smith and the black radicals.</p>
                        <p>Elwyn-Jones: I agree completely.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, if just for his

                            could follow it up, and the Government could make a formal declaration
                                Monday,<note n="4" xml:id="d208fn4">September 27.</note> just so
                            they know what the terms of reference are.</p>
                        <p>I repeat, we are in a more awkward position than you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: I agree. The Soviets
                            would be unhappy, and some of the people in Dar es Salaam.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And some of the people
                            in Dar es Salaam. This would be clearer that we were trying to install
                            our government in an area where we have no traditional
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Elwyn-Jones: One of the problems is we have a legal responsibility but no
                            political power. This has been our agony.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Insofar as we have
                            political power, we will back you up. It would be a defeat for us if
                            either Smith used it or it became chaos.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: What if there is a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would like to talk

                            precautions. But if there are further disquisitions on sexual habits . .

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Are there any other

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Many of them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: If Smith announces this .
                            . . Incidentally, is the matter of the brackets cleared up [i.e., the
                            bracketed phrase about a white chairman with no special vote, on the
                            Council of State]?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we told them they
                            could include it because no one raised the slightest objection.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: We would send a
                            representative to help structure the negotiations toward an interim
                            government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Exactly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: Then—you are right—there
                            is a whole different ball game, and you get into a dicey situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Definitely.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: Then the inducements to
                            the white community could become crucial. It could take a long time,
                            especially in your country, even two years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think a new
                            President, if he put himself behind it, could do it in his honeymoon
                            period, perhaps in the first months. I know President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> would do it immediately when
                            Congress reassembles.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: Would you give it
                            priority over the support fund?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I haven’t thought
                            about it in those terms. We could perhaps do both. We got our Middle
                            East money in a few months when we could demonstrate that peace there
                            depended on it. And I have some assurance from the Democrats so I am not
                            just speculating.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: You might get an even
                            more irresponsible Congress.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can’t get
                            assurances from the Congress, but from the candidates. We have had a
                            very chaotic situation in the last 18 months.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: But it could be the same
                            result as before.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But an elected
                            President would have, first of all, a more disciplined Administration,
                            unlike the recent time when the President had to worry about the
                            Republican structure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: But this is an area
                            where you have no responsibility.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We can’t afford to let
                            it happen. Paradoxically it is easier for us if you are in charge, than
                            if we have to explain why we are butting in in an area . . .</p>
                        <p>We have suffered setbacks before.</p>
                        <p>I briefed forty-seven Senators before I left. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMJ_1">Mike Mansfield</persName> announced, on the day
                            before Congress left, that I would be available. He expected ten to show
                            up; 47 came and I received the most unanimous backing I have received
                            since 1974.</p>
                        <pb n="585" facs="0624" xml:id="pg_585"/>
                        <p>I didn’t give magnitudes but I told them exactly what they would be
                            expected to do. No one said: “Wait a minute; this won’t fly here.” Bill
                            was there.</p>
                        <p>Rogers: And your breakfast too.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Of course, I also told
                            them the odds were against it then. So it was easier to approve.
                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: My concern is should we
                            accept some form of responsibility—that the position between <gloss
                                target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss> and independence is a British
                            responsibility—and it goes sour in that period. Either the money isn’t
                            available, or the blacks break up, or radicals challenge it. Then it is
                            the hardest time. I must say it is most imaginative attempt to break the
                            deadlock yet, but if it breaks down, we need some assurance we are not
                            just landed high and dry. And we have other commitments in Northern
                            Ireland.</p>
                        <p>The money to the whites is to persuade them to stay; before, when we
                            thought about money it was to get them to go. As you know, half of them
                            came there since <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>—and most are
                            Southern Europeans, South Africans.</p>
                        <p>But the rationale is perfectly sensible. But we must have your absolute
                            firm backing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The rationale is the
                            trust fund produces funds for investment, and the increase is available
                            for the whites. If it works perfectly, there is no problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: If it breaks down . . .
                            it looks like an incentive for the black government to nationalize.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Except then they won’t
                            get the investment.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: But they don’t always
                            think like economic men.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> will make this a high
                            priority and we can get the Democratic candidate to take the same
                            position. And Congress I can’t believe will take on a new President on a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: We have other things we
                            have cut.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: I shall resign and seek
                            refuge in Washington if the contingency reserve is cut.</p>
                        <p>If there is any shortfall anywhere else, we would go down pro tanto; we
                            wouldn’t make it up.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand that any
                            figure you give is your total contribution, that you can’t make it
                            up.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: I spoke to Trudeau, and
                            he said he would recommend it favorably to his Cabinet. But again I have
                            no idea how much.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Smith said he wasn’t
                            too anxious for too much money to be available in the first two years,
                            because he was interested in keeping people there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Did he feel
                            confident?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He said it would
                            depend on whether he could retain those two ministries.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: In full
                            independence?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, he recognizes that
                            in full independence most ministries—in fact all the ministries—would be
                            black.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Did you discuss the
                            integration of the security forces and black forces?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We didn’t discuss
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: What do you think made
                            Smith make this quantum jump? South African pressure, the guerrilla
                            warfare?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All of those factors.
                            I think the guerrilla war is pinching more than I had thought; economic
                            sanctions are biting, especially the port of Maputo. And I told him he
                            could not count on any contingency where he could count on American
                            support. And the morale problem among his young people, who wonder why
                            they should die indefinitely . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: How did he strike
                            you?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I had heard all your
                            accounts, but frankly he behaved with dignity. They had to convince
                            themselves they had no alternative—but frankly they behaved like
                            men.</p>
                        <p>Elwyn-Jones: That is our experience—until the point of final agreement. I
                            remember on HMS <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi>, we had him agreed to sign
                            a document, and we were all about to dine together with the Admiral. We
                            waited for him to come and we asked: Any news from Smith? The answer
                            was: He’s taking a tour of the boat; he has decided not to sign.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Any explanation?</p>
                        <p>Elwyn-Jones: He had to go back to the Cabinet and caucus.</p>
                        <pb n="587" facs="0626" xml:id="pg_587"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We had the same
                            situation on Sunday: We had told him we wouldn’t negotiate—and we had
                            the presence of the South African Prime Minister, who we said we would
                            hold responsible.</p>
                        <p>Lord: Plus his Cabinet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You had only
                            Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We had three other
                            Cabinet members.</p>
                        <p>Elwyn-Jones: Plus you gave a new framework.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That is a big
                            difference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: What future is there for
                            him?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Maybe he could ask for
                            a ministry, but I doubt the Rhodesians would put him forward. But I
                            deliberately stayed away from personalities.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: Yes. When they agree on
                            formation of an interim government, could they also agree on a date for
                            majority rule?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We wouldn’t object to
                            that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: It would look different
                            if it’s the 25th of December 19 . . . whatever.</p>
                        <p>What about <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We would be glad to
                            get in touch with him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I think you should.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>: There should be some
                            coordination of what should be said.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We won’t drop out of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HDW_1">Healey</persName>: Is Smith going to tell

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We are on the same
                            communication channel as you. We sort of assumed he would tell the South
                            Africans, who would tell us. For all we know he might go on television
                            and read the weather report. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Having come this far, I think it is irreversible. We hear he’s already
                            briefed his military people. If he reversed himself, he would have to

                        <p>As you are all aware, I have recently had a series of meetings in
                            Pretoria, firstly with the South African Prime Minister, then with Dr
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and finally with
                            Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and Mr <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> together.<note n="3"

                        <p>At these meetings the position of Rhodesia in relation to the rest of
                            southern Africa, and indeed to the Western nations, was discussed in <pb
                                n="589" facs="0628" xml:id="pg_589"/>great detail. It was made
                            abundantly clear to me, and to my colleagues who accompanied me, that as
                            long as the present circumstances in Rhodesia prevailed, we could expect
                            no help or support of any kind from the free world. On the contrary, the
                            pressures on us from the free world would continue to mount. Dr
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has been working
                            in close consultation with the British Government and he has the full
                            support of the other major Western powers.</p>
                        <p>Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> assured me that we
                            share a common aim and a common purpose, namely to keep Rhodesia in the
                            free world and to keep it free from Communist penetration. In this
                            regard, of course, Rhodesia is in a key position in southern Africa.
                            What happens here will inevitably affect the entire sub-continent.
                            Although we and the Western powers have a common purpose, we differ from
                            them in how best to achieve this. I would be dishonest if I did not
                            state quite clearly that the proposals which were put to us in Pretoria
                            do not represent what in our view would be the best solution for
                            Rhodesia’s problems. Regrettably, however, we were not able to make our
                            views prevail, although we were able to achieve some modifications in
                            the proposals. The American and British Governments, together with the
                            major Western powers, have made up their minds as to the kind of
                            solution they wish to see in Rhodesia and they are determined to bring
                            it about. The alternative to acceptance of the proposals was explained
                            to us in the clearest of terms, which left no room for misunderstanding.
                            Since our return Cabinet have examined in great detail and in all its
                            aspects the choice which faces us and we have done this in full
                            knowledge of the heavy responsibility which we carry for the welfare and
                            the safety of all Rhodesians, white and black. In the light of this
                            assessment, Cabinet had decided to accept the proposals put to us in
                            Pretoria and the Parliamentary caucus of my party, which met all day
                            yesterday, has endorsed our decision.</p>
                        <p>Before I spell out these proposals in detail there are some general
                            comments I should make. The proposals represent what, in negotiating
                            parlance, is usually called a “package deal”, which means that some
                            aspects are more readily acceptable than others. Firstly, on the
                            positive side, as soon as the necessary preliminaries have been carried
                            out, sanctions will be lifted and there will be a cessation of
                            terrorism. Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> has
                            given me a categorical assurance to this effect and my acceptance of the
                            proposals is conditional upon the implementation of both of these
                            undertakings.</p>
                        <p>In the light of previous experience there will be some understandable
                            scepticism regarding the undertaking that terrorism will cease, but on
                            this occasion the assurance is given, not only on the authority of the
                            United States Government, but of the British Government as well.</p>
                        <pb n="590" facs="0629" xml:id="pg_590"/>
                        <p>Since the weekend meetings we have reiterated to Dr <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and those who are working
                            with him our concern over their ability to fulfill their undertaking to
                            halt terrorism, and we stressed the responsibility which they carry in
                            this regard. They have reaffirmed to us their conviction that they will
                            be able to ensure the implementation of this condition. Nevertheless, if
                            we are realistic we must accept that terrorism cannot be halted at the
                            drop of a hat and it will therefore be incumbent on the security forces
                            and all those living in the affected areas to act accordingly. Indeed,
                            it is likely that there might be an immediate and temporary increase in
                            terrorist activity.</p>
                        <p>It is also necessary for me to issue a warning with regard to sanctions.
                            It is essential that the security of commercial information should be
                            strictly preserved in the coming months and all those concerned are
                            urged to be particularly careful not to reveal any information bearing
                            on the breaking of sanctions.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, together with the lifting of sanctions in all their forms there
                            will be an injection of development capital which will provide an
                            immediate stimulus to the economy. Thirdly, because the Western powers
                            are mindful of the need to retain the confidence of the whites, there
                            will be other far reaching financial provisions. I shall deal with these
                            more fully later in my statement.</p>
                        <p>Turning now to the constitutional aspects, the proposals provide for the
                            setting up of an interim government comprising a Council of State and a
                            Council of Ministers. The Council of State will be the supreme body and
                            it will have equal numbers of white and black members with a white
                            chairman. As is customary in the Cabinet system, decisions will normally
                            be reached by consensus, but where a vote is necessary, a two-thirds
                            majority will be required. Its first duty will be to appoint the Council
                            of Ministers. However, the most important function of the Council of
                            State will be to draw up a new constitution. Its deliberations will
                            therefore be of vital significance for the future of our country and all
                            of its people. Its decisions will determine whether Rhodesia remains a
                            stable, democratic and progressive country. It is important to note that
                            this constitution will be drawn up in Rhodesia, by Rhodesians, and will
                            not be imposed from outside. I am confident that in these circumstances
                            and, given good will and realism on both sides, the right decisions will
                            be taken. It will be a majority rule constitution and this is expressly
                            laid down in the proposals. My own position on majority rule is well
                            known. I have stated in public many times, that I believe I echo the
                            views of the majority of both black and white Rhodesians, when I say
                            that we support majority rule, provided that it is responsible rule.</p>
                        <p>The Council of State will be given two years to complete its task of
                            producing a constitution and undertaking all the detailed work neces<pb
                                n="591" facs="0630" xml:id="pg_591"/>sary for elections on the basis
                            of that constitution. Some may regard this as too short a period, but I
                            believe there are advantages in aiming at reaching finality as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Having given you the general background, I shall now read the actual
                            terms of the proposals put to me by Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. Paragraph six relating to economic aid is an
                            agreed summary of a longer paper: Quote</p>
                        <p>1. Rhodesia agrees to majority rule within two years.</p>
                        <p>2. Representatives of the Rhodesian Government will meet immediately at a
                            mutually agreed place with African leaders to organize an interim
                            government to function until majority rule is implemented.</p>
                        <p>3. The interim government should consist of a Council of State, half of
                            whose members will be black and half white with a white chairman without
                            a special vote. The European and African sides would nominate their
                            representatives. Its function should include: legislation; general
                            supervisory responsibilities; and supervision of the process of drafting
                            the constitution. The interim government should also have a Council of
                            Ministers with a majority of Africans and an African First Minister. For
                            the period of the interim government the Ministers of Defence and of Law
                            and Order would be white. Decisions of the Council of Ministers to be
                            taken by two-thirds majority. Its functions should include: delegated
                            legislative authority; and executive responsibility.</p>
                        <p>4. The United Kingdom will enact enabling legislation for this process to
                            majority rule. Upon enactment of that legislation, Rhodesia will also
                            enact such legislation as may be necessary to the process.</p>
                        <p>5. Upon the establishment of the interim government sanctions will be
                            lifted and all acts of war, including guerilla warfare, will cease.</p>
                        <p>6. Substantial economic support will be made available by the
                            international community to provide assurance to Rhodesians about the
                            economic future of the country. A trust fund will be established outside
                            Rhodesia which will organize and finance a major international effort to
                            respond to the economic opportunities of this country and to the effects
                            of the changes taking place. The fund will, inter alia, support the
                            internal and external economic circumstances of the country and provide
                            development assistance, guarantees and investment incentives to a wide
                            variety of projects. The aim will be to expand the industrial and
                            mineral production of the country, to enhance agricultural potential by
                            suitable land utilization and development programmes and to provide the
                            necessary training and educational facilities to provide the essential
                            flow of skills.</p>
                        <p>Pension rights, the investment of the individual in his own home and/or
                            farm and the remittances overseas of an individual’s liquid resources
                            within levels yet to be stipulated will be guaranteed by the interim and
                            subsequent governments. These particular measures will be <pb n="592"
                                facs="0631" xml:id="pg_592"/>underwritten by the trust fund thereby
                            giving a firm international base to the government guarantee.
                            Unquote.</p>
                        <p>That was a brief outline of the proposed support measures which have now
                            to be worked out in detail. As I have said, the measures, in particular
                            the trust fund, are aimed at giving both the European and the African
                            certainty as to his future in a multi-racial socity and to demonstrate
                            not only that the economic and social stability of the country will be
                            maintained but that every individual can look forward to continued
                            rising standards of living.</p>
                        <p>In our discussion in Pretoria, my colleagues and I made it clear that
                            Rhodesians were not enamoured of schemes to buy them out—they were
                            looking for a solution which would mean that they could go on living in
                            their homeland. We were assured that the other parties to the proposal
                            strongly supported this contention. Accordingly, whatever plan is
                            produced to assist those who decide to leave, the incentive should be
                            aimed at making it worthwhile for Rhodesians to stay.</p>
                        <p>Those are the proposals which were put to us in Pretoria. With the
                            agreement of Cabinet and with the support of caucus I have sent a
                            message to Dr <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                            indicating my acceptance of the proposals, subject to their being
                            accepted by the other parties involved, and as I stated earlier, subject
                            to the lifting of sanctions and the cessation of terrorism.</p>
                        <p>The next stage will be the meeting between government representatives and
                            African leaders to set up the Council of State, as the first stage of
                            establishing the interim government. This, I hope, will take place as
                            soon as possible, because once the decision is taken it will be in the
                            best interests of Rhodesia to proceed without delay.</p>
                        <p>I have given you the more important parts of what transpired during these
                            negotiations. Were I to continue talking for the next two hours, I would
                            not be able to tell you everything, and unfortunately there is much
                            which cannot be disclosed in public. I hope you will derive some
                            reassurance from the fact that my Cabinet, and my caucus, came to the
                            clear and positive conclusion that, on the evidence before us, this is
                            our best choice.</p>
                        <p>What I have said this evening will be the cause of deep concern to you
                            all, and understandably so. But we live in a world of rapid change and
                            if we are to survive in such a world we must be prepared to adapt
                            ourselves to change. We have the satisfaction of knowing that, in spite
                            of the odds against us, we Rhodesians of all races have built up a
                            magnificent country where the prospects are second to none in Africa. I
                            hope and believe we shall be able to keep it so.</p>
                        <p>Despite the stresses and strains imposed by terrorism the relations
                            between the races in our country remain friendly and relaxed. We are
                            moving steadily towards the removal of racial discrimination and this
                            will be seen to an increasing extent as the recommendations of the <pb
                                n="593" facs="0632" xml:id="pg_593"/>Quenet Commission are
                            implemented in the coming months. I believe that it is incumbent on all
                            of us, white and black alike, to act with dignity and restraint in the
                            testing time which lies before us, and to create the right atmosphere to
                            enable those charged with the drawing up of our new constitution to
                            proceed expeditiously with their important task.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, this agreement doesn’t give us the answer which we would have
                            liked. However, it does present us with an opportunity which we have
                            never had before—an offer to Rhodesians to work out amongst themselves,
                            without interference from outside, our future constitution. The Council
                            of State has been charged to do this within two years, which should be
                            more than ample time. As I have already indicated, the Council of State
                            will be composed of equal numbers of white and black Rhodesians. They
                            will be chosen by Rhodesians. I hope they will be the best, the most
                            responsible we can find. It will only be at the conclusion of this
                            exercise that we will know whether this whole operation has succeeded or
                            failed. I hope all Rhodesians will join with me in dedicating themselves
                            to ensure that there can only be one answer—success.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, I believe it is important that we maintain our morale and our
                            confidence. It would be unworthy of us, after all we have been through,
                            after all the sacrifices which have been made, to allow ourselves to
                            fall into any premature despondency. There is no doubt in my mind, that
                            the great fighting spirit of Rhodesians over the last decade has earned
                            great respect from the rest of the world, and had it not been for this,
                            the proposals which are now before us would not have been so
                            favourable.</p>
                        <p>For myself, I hope to share the privilege of continuing to play a part in
                            helping to guide the destiny of Rhodesia. I remain dedicated to the
                            ideal of doing all I can to ensure that Rhodesia remains a country in

                            prosper together in peace, harmony and stability. I have been
                            tremendously gratified and encouraged by the messages of support which
                            so many Rhodesians have sent me in the last week. I am confident that
                            the spirit and determination of Rhodesians remain undaunted and that we
                            shall go forward together towards our goal.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I have just received the news of <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName>’s announcement in Salisbury and want to let you
                            know how pleased I am with the progress we have made. The plan which you
                            designed and your advice throughout the negotiations made it possible
                            for us to do our part.</p>
                        <p>If the process we have launched is to lead to the conclusion we seek, it
                            is essential that the negotiations which will produce an interim
                            government for Rhodesia take place without delay. You may be assured of
                            our support during the negotiations and you have my resolve that the
                            United States will make its contribution to a final setlement, and,
                            consistent with our constitutional process, participate in the economic
                            program which our governments are discussing.</p>
                        <p>The settlement which has been advanced and the accomplishments of the
                            past six months are a tribute to the vitality of our long standing and
                            close friendship and alliance. I am glad that we have been able to work
                            together, profit from your wisdom and experience and contribute to the
                            settlement of an issue of such importance to Britain and the world at
                            large. You have my best wishes in the decisive weeks ahead.<note n="2"

                        <p>1. Please pass the following message to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. “Dear Mr. President: I understand that you and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> will be meeting very shortly to
                            discuss the Rhodesian situation, <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName>’s statement<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d209">Document 209</ref>.</note> and the next steps in
                            a settlement. I also understand that Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> has been in touch with
                            you.</p>
                        <p>3. “There are several points, in my judgment, that all of us must keep in
                            mind as we consider what <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName> said. First, Smith’s remarks were addressed to an
                            audience which could only receive the news with the deepest sense of
                            shock. He therefore used language we would not have recommended but
                            which has to be understood. Second, the Salisbury authorities are now
                            irrevocably committed to majority rule within a two-year period. Third,
                            they are also committed to the principle of a black majority interim
                            government. Fourth, the sixth point in Smith’s announcement—the economic
                            program—is a matter for discussion with the members of an international
                            consortium and not a subject on which the front line presidents need
                            take a position. Fifth, the specificity of Smith’s proposals is due in
                            large part to our pressure. We feared that a general proposal would only
                            encourage him to procrastinate later.</p>
                        <p>4. “There are aspects of Smith’s announcement which will have to be
                            developed in greater detail. I would like to share with you my thoughts
                            on the principal subjects:</p>
                        <p>—I do not believe that a meeting to negotiate the formation of an interim
                            government need take place in Salisbury or anywhere else in Rhodesia.
                            Nor do I believe that it would be advisable to hold such a meeting in
                            London. We are prepared as you and I discussed to back the convening of
                            the negotiations in any other place mutually convenient to all the
                            parties involved.</p>
                        <p>—There is no possibility that, under the proposals, Smith can run the
                            show. Indeed, once the interim government is formed, the present
                            structure in Salisbury would disappear.</p>
                        <p>—It should be understood that each side in the negotiations will be free
                            to nominate its community’s members to the Council of State. Even <pb
                                n="596" facs="0635" xml:id="pg_596"/>though the Chairman of the
                            Council of State would be European, it is our understanding that he
                            would have to be selected with the approval of the other members. In
                            short, his selection could only be based on a consensus of the members
                            at large.</p>
                        <p>—The United States will promote no individual or faction on the African
                            side. That responsibility falls to the Rhodesian nationalists and in
                            this matter you and President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> have an important role to play.</p>
                        <p>5. “I believe that the other questions raised by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName>’s statement are subject to
                            negotiation. It is my judgment, however, that an ungenerous response to
                            Smith’s statement at this point will give him the chance, which he may
                            wish, to back away from his commitment. We must avoid such an
                            eventuality at all costs. The proposals which we advanced to Smith are a
                            distillation of the consultations we had with you and the other front
                            line presidents and the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>6. “We have done everything possible to bring matters this far and cannot
                            be expected to continue our efforts if the framework which the Smith
                            announcement offers does not lead to negotiations. A breakdown in the
                            settlement at this point could only lead to continued and escalating
                            violence, so a decision not to accept the opportunity now offered would
                            be a serious one. What is needed now, in short, is a positive response
                            which will maintain momentum. A positive response is needed from the
                            African leaders now because we recognize that continued US pressure may
                            be necessary to keep the Rhodesians to the execution of the conditions
                            in the proposals. This we pledge, if the African response enables
                            negotiations to go forward.</p>
                        <p>7. “Your wisdom and foresight has been vital in bringing the process thus
                            far and I completely share the views you so eloquently expressed that
                            there may not be another opportunity and matters may take their
                            inexorable course. It is my earnest hope that the momentum towards a
                            settlement and peace can be maintained and that the parties to the
                            negotiations will meet without delay.</p>
                        <p>8. “I look forward to having yours and President <persName

                            opportune time as it reached me in the midst of our summit. It clarified
                            a number of points which have been a source of worry to us and helped in
                            facilitating the discussions. Our conclusions were reached in the light

                            gained and success appears so near.</p>
                        <p>As Ambassador Low will have reported to you, the summit was unanimous in
                            its conclusions that a breakthrough has been made. We were, of course,
                            concerned, as we believe you were, about the manner in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName> presented the proposals
                            which raised some doubts as to whether or not he could not once again
                            upset the apple cart. With our knowledge of him and his colleagues, it
                            is necessary to proceed in this exercise with caution while maintaining
                            the momentum in the implementation of the Anglo-American programme. Our
                            tactics must, therefore, be correct.</p>
                        <p>To this end, it is essential that <persName corresp="#p_SID_1"
                                >Smith</persName> should not himself call the meeting since he has
                            earned such a bad reputation. In order to speed and maintain credibility
                            right from the beginning, it should be clear to everybody that it is not
                                <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> who has the power to
                            organise and manage the meeting of the representatives of the
                            nationalists and the whites. I need not mention that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName>’s performance in this respect in
                            the past left a good deal to be desired.</p>
                        <p>We, therefore, resolved to call upon Britain to organise and chair the
                            meeting. The purpose of the meeting should be:—</p>
                        <pb n="598" facs="0637" xml:id="pg_598"/>
                        <p>(A) to discuss the structure and functions of the transitional
                            government;</p>
                        <p>(B) to establish an African majority transitional government;</p>
                        <p>(C) to discuss the modalities for convening a full constitutional
                            conference to work out the independence constitution;</p>
                        <p>(D) to establish the basis upon which peace and normalcy can be restored
                            in the territory.</p>
                        <p>We believe that these requirements are within the general framework of
                            the Anglo-American proposals and that there is no contradiction between
                            what you put forward and our stand in this connection.</p>
                        <p>During our meeting we found some problems in the emphasis given by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> to the Council of
                            State. We were happy though to note that the selection of the Chairman
                            would be based on the consensus of all those involved. This would remove
                            Smith from the scene; and this is important to the nationalists. It
                            would certainly remove the possibilities of a break-down in the
                            negotiations to establish the transitional government.</p>
                        <p>The Council of State will certainly cause some anxieties. British
                            presence in the Council of State would be a source of confidence to the
                            nationalists and I believe to the whites as well. You should, therefore,
                            consider the possibility of parity between nationalists and the
                            Rhodesian Front in the Council of State, but the Chairman being a Briton
                            appointed by the British Government. In this case, the smaller the size
                            of the Council of State, the better.</p>
                        <p>Another problem is the allocation of portfolios. At the moment, all the
                            military commanders and police are white and will presumably remain so
                            throughout the period of transition. The political head does not appear
                            to be an over-riding factor in a situation like this one. It should,
                            therefore, not come as a surprise if the nationalist side demands a more
                            realistic approach in this matter and asks for slight adjustments to
                            reflect the situation which will exist after the transitional period. We
                            believe that after confidence has been built up between whites and
                            blacks and there is an acceptance of the transitional government, the
                            whites could possibly be made to realise that there would be greater
                            security in making this readjustment at this time.</p>
                        <p>When the details are being worked out, it is problems like these that are
                            bound to arise, and it is in this context that you should read our
                            penultimate paragraph in the statement issued by the five heads of state
                            at the end of their summit in Lusaka on 26th September, 1976.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d212fn3">For the text of the statement, see <hi
                                    rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, September 27, 1976, p.

                        <p>Against this background, I therefore urge you to put maximum pressure on
                            the British to organise the meeting to establish a transitional
                            government very quickly indeed. I also urge you to pressure the <pb
                                n="599" facs="0638" xml:id="pg_599"/>South Africans to ensure that
                            the whites in Rhodesia understand that they should go to the conference
                            with an open mind to establish peace and stability. The question of the
                            cessation of the guerrilla war and the lifting of the sanctions will
                            automatically follow the agreement to establish the transitional
                            government. The point is that we should form a transitional government
                            with the degree of credibility that enables it to actually call upon the
                            guerrilla fighters to cease fire.</p>

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin text:</hi></p>
                        <p>In my address to the nation on 25th September I indicated that my
                            acceptance of the proposals had been forced on me by the Western powers
                            who had made it clear that in our fight against terrorism and in our
                            economic problems the present Rhodesian Government could expect no help
                            or support of any kind from the West but that, on the contrary, if I did
                            not accept the proposals the pressures on Rhodesia would be
                            progressively increased.</p>
                        <p>I have frequently warned in public statements and in exchanges with
                            governments that a rapid handover to black rule in Rhodesia would lead
                            to chaos which the Communists would be quick to exploit and which would
                            cause the great majority of whites to leave the country. These views are
                            by no means confined to members of my government. They have been stated
                            repeatedly to British Government representatives by my political
                            opponents and by a wide range of Rhodesian industrialists and
                            businessmen.</p>
                        <p>In forcing me into the position where I had no alternative but to accept
                            the Anglo-American proposals, the Western governments concerned have
                            discounted my own views and those of the responsible Rhodesians whom I
                            have mentioned. This places on the shoulders of these Western
                            governments a heavy responsibility for what now ensues in Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>Despite my misgivings I have gone out of my way to try to make these
                            proposals acceptable to white Rhodesians and to encourage them to
                            believe that it will be possible to establish responsible majority rule
                            by a government which would realise the importance of the white people
                            in maintaining the stability of the economy and the defence of the
                            country and which would go out of their way to encourage them to stay.
                            In some quarters my efforts were greeted with scepticism, but I
                            persisted in the spirit as well as the letter of the agreement we
                            reached in Pretoria. My statement to the nation was couched in language
                            designed to encourage white people—and, indeed, moderate black people—to
                            believe that there would be a secure future for them in an independent
                            Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>The immediate response to my speech was one of cautious support coupled
                            with determination to make the best of the altered circum<pb n="601"
                                facs="0640" xml:id="pg_601"/>stances. I must inform you, however,
                            that in the last two days there has been a marked change in public
                            opinion. This has been caused mainly by the militant and the
                            intransigent attitude of certain black presidents and by the statements
                            of nationalists such as <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> of
                            which you are no doubt aware. The inclusion of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NA_1">Neto</persName> at this late stage has contributed
                            to the disillusionment felt here, for he has nothing to gain from a
                            Rhodesian settlement and is unlikely to exercise a moderating influence
                            on Rhodesian Africans. The failure of the latter to reach any agreement
                            among themselves is a forewarning of coming power struggles.</p>
                        <p>I have to tell you that I am becoming increasingly concerned about the
                            situation. If a man such as <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> is put forward by the black presidents as a
                            leader of the African nationalists, the effect on public opinion, both
                            among whites and among blacks, will be extremely serious. This man has a
                            long record of Communist affiliation and he is now emerging as the
                            apparent spokesman of the terrorists based in Mozambique. His recent
                            statements and those of the terrorist leaders can leave no room for any
                            doubt as to their real intention, which is to establish a Marxist-type
                            military dictatorship in Rhodesia on the model of that in Mozambique. It
                            appears that in this aim they have the full support of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In the last two days I and my colleagues and other persons in authority
                            or in touch with African opinion have received numerous expressions of
                            real fear on the part of ordinary peaceful Rhodesian Africans who owe no
                            allegiance to the terrorists and who give them no support other than
                            that which is extracted by intimidation. These people are imploring us
                            not to hand over the Government of Rhodesia to the Mugabes and their
                            like. They are intelligent people—businessmen, farmers, teachers and,
                            indeed, politicians—who have the education and the background knowledge
                            to appreciate what it would mean if men like <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> came to power.</p>
                        <p>On Friday afternoon I addressed a meeting of the top civil servants in
                            the country. I urged them to take the view that it was their duty as
                            civil servants to do all they can to ease the transition to majority
                            government and I assured them of my confidence that it would be a
                            responsible majority government which would give all public servants
                            reasonable prospects of a satisfying career in a country in which they
                            would be happy to have their children grow up and be educated. I met
                            with a favourable response. However, again in this field the situation
                            has changed drastically this week. Public servants at all levels are now
                            questioning the validity of my assurances and there are strong
                            indications that many of them will want to leave the country. They have
                            noted the reported words of President <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> to the effect that the economic aid provided by
                            the Western world should be used to en<pb n="602" facs="0641"
                                xml:id="pg_602"/>courage the whites to go and not to stay and they
                            have noted similar remarks by President <persName corresp="#p_MS_2"
                                >Machel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                            >Mugabe</persName>. They are now asking that the government should make
                            special provision for them to be able to leave before independence with
                            terminal benefits to compensate for loss of career.</p>
                        <p>Other important categories in a similar position are members of the armed
                            forces and the staffs of statutory bodies such as the Rhodesia Railways
                            and the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. The latter have skills
                            which would be in high demand elsewhere and their departure would be a
                            crippling blow to the Rhodesian economy.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly concerned about the need to maintain morale and
                            motivation in the security forces during the period of the interim
                            government because so far there is no indication of any intention on the
                            part of the Mozambique Government or of the terrorists operating out of
                            that territory to halt their attacks. On the contrary, I anticipate that
                            the latter will endeavour, with Communist support, to establish a firm
                            foothold in a sector of Rhodesia adjacent to the Mozambique border.</p>
                        <p>I feel that I must warn you that, unless steps are taken urgently to
                            reverse the current trend of loss of confidence among white Rhodesians,
                            the position will continue to deteriorate and there will be a real
                            danger of a collapse of the economy and of the whole complex structure
                            of government and of the security forces. If this should happen the
                            Western powers who have forced Rhodesia into this situation will bear a
                            heavy responsibility. <hi rend="italic">End text.</hi></p>

                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName>:</p>
                        <p>2. “Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName>: I have just
                            received your message in which you express your concern about the
                            situation which has developed in the aftermath of your courageous public
                            declaration. I can understand your concern and I appreciate the fact
                            that you have remained steadfast in the face of the difficulties which
                            have arisen. We are aware of the pressures under which you are
                            operating.</p>
                        <p>3. “I must stress, however, that we reject the proposition that we forced
                            you into making the announcement which you made on September 24.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">See <ref target="#d209">Document
                                209</ref>.</note> It was clear to me from our discussions in
                                Pretoria<note n="4" xml:id="d214fn4">See <ref target="#d206"
                                    >Document 206</ref>.</note> that you understood, as I do, the
                            realities which Rhodesia faces are the compelling reasons behind your
                            decision. It is my firm judgment that had you not taken the wise
                            decision the objective facts in one year would have compelled you to
                            seek a settlement under worse circumstances. Our offer gave an
                            opportunity—but not a guarantee—for a moderate solution. I want to
                            repeat what I told you in Pretoria. If you prefer to fight rather than
                            to negotiate the decision is up to you. Whichever course you choose will
                            have no consequence for the United States. I must remind you, however,
                            that you can expect no help from us.</p>
                        <p>4. “I share your concerns about the radicals. It may well be their
                            strategy as well as that of the Soviets to delay the convening of the
                            conference and the installation of moderate African leadership in order
                            to improve their military position. We should not allow that strategy to
                            succeed and the best way to do so is to insure that an interim
                            government under moderate leadership is installed rapidly.</p>
                        <p>5. “We did not know the Angolan Prime Minister would be present at the
                            Lusaka meeting<note n="5" xml:id="d214fn5">See <ref target="#d213fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 213</ref>.</note> and were as surprised as
                            you. Nor did we appreciate the rhetoric used in Lusaka. I have made it
                            clear to the front-line presidents that certain of the public statements
                            made in other African capitals have not contributed to progress towards
                            a negotiated settlement. It is important, however, to remember that the
                            front-line presidents have their own political constituents.</p>
                        <p>6. “In our judgment the way to a negotiated settlement is open. We have
                            studied carefully the statements which the presidents made in Lusaka.
                            There has been no significant rejection of the five points. Nor, in
                            fact, has there been a conclusive rejection of the two ministries being
                            held by the Europeans.</p>

                        <p>7. “We believe that the final shape of an interim government will emerge
                            in a manner much more acceptable to you through direct discussions with
                            the Rhodesian nationalists than if we and the British try to negotiate
                            the subject with the front-line presidents before the conference begins.
                            As you know, the British, with our strong support are moving quickly to
                            call the conference. They have done this on the understanding that this
                            was something you thought would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>8. “It is in all of our interests to organize rapidly a meeting which
                            will set up an interim government. The Rhodesian nationalists who wish
                            to participate in the interim government have different purposes. I
                            suggest you defer your judgment on the positions they will take until we
                            have a chance to see what proposals they will put forward.</p>
                        <p>9. “If we are to continue to be helpful, we cannot do so unless the
                            misrepresentations and press leaks cease immediately. <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>U.S.–U.K. Discussions of Economic Support Plan for Rhodesia</p>
                        <p>Yesterday and this morning we had a full day and a half of talks with the

                            progress was made in defining the issues and problems, exchanging data
                            and technical analysis and in developing a plan for the next diplomatic
                            steps to organize the Fund.</p>
                        <p>The British indicated that the conference for organizing the interim
                            government might take place in the next ten days or two weeks. They do
                            not want to discuss the economic plan at the conference. We both
                            recognize, however, that Smith may want to discuss it in order to
                            provide a rationale for accepting some of the political concessions that
                            he may have to make. He may also want to test nationalist willingness to
                            consider such a plan. Thus, we ought to have gone as far as we can in
                            lining up support from potential donors and in defining the basic
                            purposes and modes of operation of the plan. We both agreed that the
                            potential impact that the economic plan might have on the success or
                            failure of the conference ought to be the standard against which we
                            measure the desirability of any immediate actions on the plan. In our
                            meeting in New York with <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor
                                Richard</persName>, we might discuss these issues with him.</p>
                        <p>Our tentative strategy is the following:</p>
                        <p>First, prepare a short paper stating the purposes and functions of an
                            international economic fund for Rhodesia. This paper could be a common
                            basis for bilateral approaches to potential donors and, possibly, for
                            Richard to use as he sees desirable in the conference discussions. The
                            short paper might have some more detailed annexes that would be
                            illustrative of the kinds of programs that the international fund might
                            support. We have reached agreement on the major contents of such a
                            paper. We will work on a draft this week and hope to agree on a final
                            text in London next week.</p>
                        <p>Second, we would communicate this text at the highest levels to potential
                            donors, possibly at the same time mentioning some illustrative amounts
                            that we feel might be appropriate for each donor.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d215fn2">See <ref target="#d234">Document
                            234</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Third, we might send a joint British-U.S. diplomatic team or bilateral
                            envoys to major donor capitals to follow-up on the high-level
                            communication, discuss concrete numbers, and answer questions on
                            details.</p>
                        <pb n="606" facs="0645" xml:id="pg_606"/>
                        <p>Fourth, we could issue a call for a donor conference to meet sometime
                            this fall to pledge amounts and discuss draft articles for the fund.</p>
                        <p>This plan should be flexible as to timing in order to maximize its
                            positive contribution to the success of the political conference chaired
                            by the British.</p>
                        <p>We discussed total financial support for the international plan with the
                            British and a formula for burden sharing amount donors. We thought that
                            total funding in the range of $900 million to $1.3 billion would be a
                            reasonable target, depending on the number of other donors we might
                            attract. This amount fits in roughly with what the British estimate
                            might be the total requirements for external assistance on concessional
                            terms. Part of this total might be attributable capital lent by
                            bilateral aid agencies on concessional terms. A large portion, however,
                            would be paid in directly to the international fund. All of it would be
                            additional aid since there is no aid presently going to Rhodesia. In
                            addition, we would expect a large amount of private capital to flow on
                            commercial terms to Rhodesia. Part of this might be government supported
                            through Export-Import Bank loans and <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1"
                                >OPIC</gloss> investment guarantees. Thus, total government
                            supported capital from participants in the fund could be of the order of
                            $2 billion. For now, however, we wish to concentrate donor attention on
                            the concessional aid component of the fund.</p>
                        <p>A very rough and tentative donor contribution schedule was discussed (see
                            Tab A).<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> We
                            think it may be possible to meet a major part of a U.S. contribution of
                            $100 million per year within levels of aid for Africa already programmed
                            for Africa for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 78 and <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 79. The British feel that they would
                            have to strain to get their contribution up to $40 million a year. South
                            Africa is not on the list of primary donors. We talked, however, of the
                            possibility of a separate bilateral agreement between South Africa and
                            either the Zimbabwe Government or the Fund to bear part of the expense
                            of resettling emigrants to South Africa.</p>
                        <p>The British seemed to like the idea I proposed to them that the Fund
                            would be managed by the World Bank, using existing World Bank staff as
                            much as possible and existing executive directors with a separate voting
                            arrangement for purposes of the Fund. The British agreed that we should
                            make an approach to <persName corresp="#p_MRS_1">McNamara</persName>
                            when he returns from Manila to get his reactions to the possibility of
                            Bank involvement.</p>
                        <p>After we conclude our meetings with the British and the South Africans,
                            and before we take off for London, I plan to put together an in<pb
                                n="607" facs="0646" xml:id="pg_607"/>teragency working group to
                            begin to bring other agencies along. I have already talked to Ed Yeo and
                            Jim Lynn about this group.</p>

                            Smith’s Comments about Annex C.</p>
                        <p>1. You should request an urgent appointment with Smith and hand him the
                            following memo.</p>
                        <p>2. Quote: There have been a number of comments from Rhodesian authorities
                            about American commitments. We want to give you our recollection of
                            events which is what our policy is based on. On September 19 in Pretoria
                            after the original five points had been presented to you<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d216fn2">See <ref target="#d206">Document 206</ref>.</note>
                            but before you accepted them and after you were informed that the U.S.
                            would use Annex C as a basis of its policy. We provided Annex C to your
                            representative the same night.</p>
                        <p>3. Neither Annex C nor the five points, as of September 19, included the
                            provision for a white chairman and two white security ministers. When
                            you raised these points you were informed that they had not been
                            discussed either with the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> or the
                            African presidents. Subsequently, after consultations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the African presidents, you were
                            informed that these two issues would be difficult but perhaps manageable
                            and could be included as modifications of the original five points.</p>
                        <p>4. This sequence of events clearly demonstrates that these two points,
                            which have become indeed difficult, were added later and were not
                            included in the original five points as they were presented to you in
                            Pretoria. Unquote.</p>
                        <p>5. Orally you should make the following points to Smith:</p>
                        <pb n="608" facs="0647" xml:id="pg_608"/>
                        <p>—It seems to us that he should not be exposing himself to the press or
                            allow himself to be led into discussion of details.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. is appalled that he has made public reference to Annex C (which
                            has not been given to the Africans) despite requests from us directly
                            and through South Africa and Great Britain that he not do so.</p>
                        <p>—The end result can only make it more difficult for his own position in
                            the conference.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. cannot be put under pressure by public statements.</p>
                        <p>—If it continues we will have to wash our hands of our efforts and Smith
                            will have to do what he can on his own.</p>
                        <p>—However, you may tell him that we continue to stand behind Annex C and
                            will not push him beyond it as stated in your original instructions.</p>
                        <p>—You may also inform him of the Secretary’s high personal regard for
                            Smith, his desire to work with him, and the great sympathy he has for
                            him and his population in these circumstances.</p>

                        <p>—general supervisory responsibilities; and</p>
                        <p>—supervision of the process of drafting the constitution.</p>
                        <p>The interim government should also have a Council of Ministers with a
                            majority of Africans and an African First Minister, decisions of the
                            Council of Ministers to be taken by two-thirds majority. For the period
                            of the interim government the Defense, and Law and Order Ministers would
                            be European. Its functions should include:</p>

                        <p>—and executive responsibility.</p>
                        <p>5. “The United Kingdom will enact enabling legislation for this process
                            to majority rule.</p>
                        <p>Upon enactment of that legislation, Rhodesia will also enact such
                            legislation as may be necessary to the process.</p>
                        <p>6. “Upon the establishment of the interim government, sanctions will be
                            lifted and all acts of war including guerrilla warfare will cease.” <hi

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian Smith</persName>, accompanied only by
                            his private secretary, received me at 12:30 local time and read slowly
                            and carefully the written mes<pb n="610" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_610"
                            />sage which I delivered. He took immediate issue with the sentence
                            which reads “subsequently after consultations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and the African presidents, you were
                            informed that these two issues would be difficult but perhaps manageable
                            and could be included as modifications of the original five points.”</p>
                        <p>2. While he did not want to pick a fight with the United States, Smith
                            argued forcefully and returned to the point frequently during our
                            meeting that the message of assurance he had received through our
                            Ambassador and his representative in Pretoria was quite categorical and
                            did not have the same meaning. Without our message of assurance that the
                            Africans had accepted the five points, he would not have attempted to
                            sell his acceptance to the Cabinet or his people. During the
                            conversation he repeated several times that this exercise would never
                            have begun without Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>’s assurances as contained in the message from
                            Pretoria.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> said that he had the
                            message with him in Geneva and could “substantiate” his point if
                            necessary. He did not say or give the impression that he planned to take
                            the extreme step of making it public. (John Snell told me after the
                            meeting he wanted to send to me the text of the message as <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> received it from Pretoria).
                                <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> stated that “we must
                            try to clear this up” and that he would be most upset if it were thought
                            that he had misrepresented Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. I then asked <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName>’s
                            permission to complete my oral instructions which he accepted calmly and
                            stonefaced. He regretted the public discussion of Annex C but felt he
                            had been driven to mention it because Richard had referred to Annex C so
                            frequently in his meeting of Oct 23 and had made clear to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> that he regarded it and not the
                            five points as the document under negotiation.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d218fn3">In telegram 8348 from Geneva, October 25, the
                                Mission reported on the meeting between Richard and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName>. Richard stated the British
                                “regarded Annex C as a reasonable basis and would do what we could
                                to achieve it.” He noted that “the British Government could not
                                however be committed to all details without negotiations.”
                                    (<persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Library, National
                                Security Adviser, Presidential Country Files for Europe and Canada,

                                    target="#t_Nodis_1">Nodis</gloss> (9))</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> said that in their first
                            meeting Richard “had almost pooh-poohed the five points” and had said
                            “we are working to Annex C”. By the second meeting, Smith said Richard
                            had “changed his tune” somewhat and had said that the British would try
                            to work with the “five principles”. He had also been forced to mention
                            Annex C because he understood from his press officers that the British
                            had leaked the fact of its existence to the press. His delegation had
                            received inquiries from reporters who said the British had done so. In
                            short he had been forced into his position by the “antics of the
                            British.”</p>
                        <pb n="611" facs="0650" xml:id="pg_611"/>
                        <p>5. Smith’s defense was not logical. I told him that the first we had
                            heard about the press interest in Annex C was after his press
                            conference. I also told him that while I could not speak for the British
                            I understood the British were giving the five points a hard run with the
                            Africans and would wish at an appropriate time in the negotiations to
                            work for the best outcome possible drawing from everything available
                            including Annex C. I reiterated that we view the difference between the
                            two documents as his margin of safety which he must do all necessary to
                            defend.</p>
                        <p>6. His only other comment on the instructed oral points was his defense
                            of his speaking out in public and to the press. He had to reassure his
                            people on the issues of the conference. He laid great emphasis on the
                            need to not lose his support at home. If the people feel he had lied to
                            them, he’d be laughed out of office. “If I don’t reply when the British
                            claim I misrepresent the understandings, then I had better get out of my
                            present job.” If white Rhodesians become upset, “we will lose them”.
                            “Our lives are at stake; we must be careful.” I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> we did not question legitimate
                            self-defense but saw no reason in his discussing detailed negotiating
                            positions and issues in public. I urged specifically to make no further
                            reference to Annex C.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName> returned to the
                            categorical nature of the Secretary’s assurances which he described as a
                            “firm contract” and said only our word had convinced the Rhodesian
                            people that the presidents would stand by the agreement as they
                            promised. He said “I could only convince my colleagues by assuring them
                            of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s prestige and
                            power and the power of the United States as the greatest nation.” I told
                                <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Smith</persName>, as a personal
                            observation, that as a man with long African negotiating experience he
                            must accept the fact that the five points are a political and not a
                            legal document. He said he appreciated this point but feared the
                            negotiations were heading for the same fate as those which took place at
                            Victoria Falls where the African nationalists went back on “categorical”
                            agreements that had been reached between <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> and the African Presidents. He said “I hope I am
                            wrong but we may be heading in that direction.” I urged steadiness and
                            repeated the Secretary’s appreciation for his difficult position and our
                            willingness to work with him. Smith reciprocated and urged I transmit
                            his sincere regrets for the misunderstandings.</p>
                        <p>9. Smith was off balance and defensive throughout the meeting. His
                            justification for mentioning Annex C was not convincing.</p>

                            Subject: Annex C.</p>
                        <p>Per your request following is text of Annex C (with Rogers added para 10)
                            as of September 12, 1976, which is the currently operative text.</p>
                        <p>Rhodesia: Possible Constitutional Arrangements for the Period of
                            Transition</p>
                        <p>1. It is postulated that:</p>
                        <p>A. Any interim administration must be legalized by the British
                            Government;</p>
                        <p>B. Britain would appoint a British Government representative in
                            Salisbury.</p>
                        <p>2. In British domestic law, Rhodesia remains a British colony and the
                            Queen (as Queen of the United Kingdom) is the sovereign of the
                            territory. This would remain the legal position until the time came to
                            grant independence.</p>
                        <p>3. In order to legalize the situation in Rhodesia, following agreement on
                            a constitutional settlement, it would be necessary for the British
                            Parliament to pass a new act. The 1965 Southern Rhodesia Act does not
                            confer powers to suspend or revoke the Rhodesian constitution of 1961 or
                            to amend that constitution out of all recognition. But the 1961
                            constitution would not provide an appropriate framework for the period
                            of transition.</p>
                        <p>4. The new act would be an enabling instrument, i.e, it would empower the
                            British Government to impose constitutional change in Rhodesia by orders
                            in Council (which would probably have to be subject to an affirmative
                            resolution by both houses of the British Parliament). A bill to enact an
                            amendment to the 1965 legislation could not be introduced in the British
                            Parliament until it reassembles in mid-October (unless it were to be
                            recalled earlier for that special purpose).</p>
                        <p>5. It would in any case take time to prepare the necessary consequential
                            legislation. One major technical problem is posed by the need to
                            determine which of the post-<gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>
                            enactments of the Rhodesian Parliament should be retrospectively
                            validated and which should be annulled or amended. It would also be
                            necessary to provide for a political <pb n="613" facs="0652"
                                xml:id="pg_613"/>amnesty which would, on the one hand, free
                            political detainees and prisoners from Rhodesian restraints and, on the
                            other, protect members of the administration against prosecution or
                            civil suit for past illegal acts.</p>
                        <p>Legislative and Executive Authority in Rhodesia</p>
                        <p>6. The new act would have to vest legislative and executive authority
                            within Rhodesia in local organs of government. We envisage the formation
                            of a two tier system, comprising a “Council of State” and a “Council of
                            Ministers” and providing for internal checks and balances, designed as
                            far as possible to be self-regulating and to obviate the need for the
                            British Parliament to intervene in the Government of Rhodesia during the
                            transitional period.</p>
                        <p>7. While the form of any interim administration would be partly a matter
                            for the British Parliament, its composition would be a matter for
                            decision by the Rhodesians themselves. The responsibility for choosing
                            the members of the Council of State and of the Council of Ministers must
                            lie in Rhodesia, even though the formal appointment of members of the
                            former will have to be made by the Queen of the United Kingdom. At the
                            same time, the allocation of responsibilities set out below must be
                            based on the assumption that the members of the organs of government
                            during the interim period would, by and large, have been chosen from
                            among those who genuinely subscribed to, or acquiesced in, the aim of a
                            rapid and orderly transition of majority rule.</p>
                        <p>The Council of State</p>
                        <p>8. For the Council of State, we could envisage the following:</p>
                        <p>I. Composition: The Council would be composed of between 5 to 7 members,
                            with a pre-determined ratio, which would have to be maintained
                            throughout, between the European and the African members. The members of
                            the Council would elect their own Chairman. He would be primus inter
                            pares and would have no special status. The ratio of membership could be
                            3 to 2 or 4 to 3 in favor of the Africans; or there could be parity but
                            in that event it would be laid down that the Chairman of the Council
                            would be African.</p>
                        <p>II. Appointment of members: By the Queen of the United Kingdom, formally
                            acting on the advice of her Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but
                            the latter would have no power of choice: he would endorse local
                            Rhodesian choices.</p>
                        <p>(A) The composition of the first Council of State would be decided in the
                            course of negotiations between the European caretaker government and the
                            African nationalists. In the event that they were unable to reach
                            consensus, the European and African sides would both have the right to
                            nominate the number of representatives to which they were respectively
                            entitled. Neither side could veto the choice of the <pb n="614"
                                facs="0653" xml:id="pg_614"/>other: all those nominated would have
                            to take an oath binding themselves to work for a rapid and orderly
                            transition to majority rule. An additional safeguard (and this would
                            point to a 7—rather than a 5 or 6 man Council) would be to provide that
                            the Europeans and Africans would have the right to nominate one member
                            of the other race.</p>
                        <p>(B) Subsequent appointments would be by co-option, requiring at least a
                            two-thirds majority. The only proviso would be that a departing member
                            must be replaced by someone of the same race or that, where a departing
                            member had been initially nominated by the other side, the choice of the
                            replacement would lie solely with the members of that other side.</p>
                        <p>III. Voting: The decisions of the Council would normally be taken by
                            consensus: where a vote was necessary, at least a two-thirds majority
                            should be required, except that a decision to dismiss the Chief Minister
                            or the Chief of Staff of the armed forces would have to be
                            unanimous.</p>
                        <p>IV. Legislative authority: Full legislative authority would be vested in
                            the Council: it alone would have power to enact primary legislation,
                            though it could delegate its powers in respect of subordinate
                            legislation to the Council of Ministers or to individual ministers.
                            Responsibility for initiating proposals for legislation would rest with
                            the Council of Ministers though, in the spheres mentioned in (V) (A)
                            below, the Council of State would have power to amend the former’s
                            proposals and elsewhere to suggest amendments. These latter would stand
                            unless overriden by a vote of a pre-determined size in the Council of
                            Ministers.</p>
                        <p>V. Executive powers:</p>
                        <p>A. The Council of State would have ultimate authority in matters related
                            to the implementation of the programme for progress to majority rule and
                            (see also VI below) to defense and internal security. In both spheres,
                            it could issue directives to the Council of Ministers to individual
                            ministers or to officials.</p>
                        <p>B. It would have the right to be kept informed of the proceedings of the
                            Council of Ministers (one possibility would be to arrange for a joint
                            secretariat to service both Councils).</p>
                        <p>C. The Council would be responsible for the appointments and dismissal of
                            all members of the Council of Ministers, at its discretion alone; other
                            appointments and dismissals, and the allocation of portfolios, would,
                            however, be made only after consultation with the Chief Minister, whose
                            advice would be binding.</p>
                        <p>D. The Council would also be responsible for the appointment and
                            dismissal of: members of the judiciary (whose dismissal would, however,
                            be subject to the usual safeguards); the chiefs of the armed forces <pb
                                n="615" facs="0654" xml:id="pg_615"/>and of the police; and the
                            senior members (down to a grade to be determined) of the public
                            service.</p>
                        <p>E. The Council would also exercise the prerogative of mercy.</p>
                        <p>The Council of Ministers</p>
                        <p>9. For the Council of Ministers, we could envisage the following:</p>
                        <p>I. Appointment of members: See paragraph 8 (IV) (C) above.</p>
                        <p>II. Composition: The Council would be composed of a Chief Minister, who
                            would be an African, and would contain a majority of African
                            members.</p>
                        <p>III. Voting: Normally, under the doctrine of collective responsibility,
                            no vote ought to be necessary but, where there was a clear division of
                            opinion, it might be necessary to provide for a vote to be taken. In
                            such an event, it would be important to ensure that a mere majority did
                            not suffice; for that could, theoretically, lead to a situation in which
                            the European members were permanently outvoted. One possibility would be
                            to provide for a two thirds majority to be required as the norm and,
                            where this could not be achieved, for the decision to lie with the
                            Council of State.</p>
                        <p>IV. The quorum: It would be necessary to make provision for a quorum,
                            perhaps of a least half of the African and half of the European
                            members.</p>
                        <p>V. The Council’s business: The initiative for proposing the agenda would
                            lie with the Chief Minister, but every member of the Council would be
                            entitled to propose items for agenda and should have the right to insist
                            on their being discussed.</p>
                        <p>The British Role</p>
                        <p>10. The organs of government would have authority for a predetermined
                            period perhaps not exceeding two years.</p>
                        <p>11. Britain would remain responsible for external affairs during the
                            interim period and there would be a British Government representative in
                            Salisbury. He would not be a representative of the Queen. His function
                            would be quasi-diplomatic: to monitor the programme of progress to
                            majority rule and, where necessary, to make available his good offices
                            to mediate in any matter affecting the carrying through of the
                            programme.</p>

                        <p>8710. For the Secretary from <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName>. Subject: Rhodesian Conference: British Game
                            Plan.</p>
                        <p>1. My consultations with <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>
                            lead me to conclude that the British plan at Geneva, for the present,
                            consists of confirming a date of independence and majority rule and then
                            moving to the question of an interim government. With respect to the
                            date for independence, <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>
                            plans to attach to a confirmed date specific conditions. These may
                            include an assurance no final date will be settled until the
                            constitution is drafted.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName> will avoid any
                            discussion of the franchise and work to make sure that question is
                            raised only after the interim government is formed. He will hold out
                            until a much later date Geneva consideration of Britain’s role during
                            the period of transition.</p>
                        <p>3. Once the independence date issue is resolved, the British will resist
                            further African suggestions that preconditions be set and undertake
                            immediate discussion of the structure and functions of an interim
                            government. As I noted in Geneva’s 8688,<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">In
                                telegram 8688 from Geneva, November 3, <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"

                            asked each delegation to submit proposals; only <persName

                            satisfactory discussion paper. These proposals developed by each
                            delegation will be circulated to the other delegations and comments will
                            be solicited.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName> wishes to maintain his
                            tactical flexibility. He will pursue the negotiations in a variety of
                            fora. Depending on the situation he will meet privately with delegation
                            principals and their key subordinates. He will reinforce his meetings
                            with the nationalists through informal sessions with the observers. Once
                            consensus on a given issue has emerged, he plans to hold confidential
                            inter-delegation meetings like the one he chaired yesterday, i.e.,
                            without observers and with limited number of advisors for each
                            delegation. <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName> will convene
                            more formal plenary sessions only when agreement has been achieved and

                            many advantages—principally the discouragement of African public
                            rhetoric.</p>
                        <p>5. Tactically <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName> will open
                            discussion of specific items and if a consensus does not develop will
                            move on to new issues returning to the unresolved ones at a later
                            point.</p>
                        <p>6. Even though the British have refused to be “nailed to the five points”
                            and the Africans have rejected them categorically, the five points have
                            emerged as the conference’s informal agenda. The first
                            point—independence and majority rule—is under consideration now. The
                            second point has been met. The framework of point three has effectively
                            been accepted by all delegations as the basis for the next round of
                            negotiations.</p>

                            greater flexibility on the independence date issue. He greatly
                            appreciated my approaches to Smith.</p>

                        <p>1. If, as British hope, the date of independence issue can be resolved or
                            finessed, and this is not certain, the conference will then move on to
                            discussing the structure and functions of the interim government. Some
                            African delegates continue to believe that once the independence hurdle
                            is overcome the remaining path toward an interim government will be
                            relatively smooth. This is wishful thinking. Future substantive and
                            symbolic issues will provide a continuing source of pitfalls which <pb
                                n="618" facs="0657" xml:id="pg_618"/>can be skirted only by skillful
                            negotiating, firm British chairmanship, greater flexibility than the
                            participants have evidenced to date, a more constructive front line
                            role, and almost certainly increased American involvement.</p>
                        <p>2. To the present, the conference principals and their immediate advisors
                            have focussed their attention almost exclusively on the date of
                            independence issue. Though no formal positions have emerged on other,
                            even more thorny topics, there has been considerable corridor talk and
                            speculation, some of which has come to our attention. No positions have
                            changed radically. Nevertheless, interesting nuances are appearing as
                            simplistic rhetoric is confronted by an exceedingly complex reality.</p>
                        <p>3. The Africans’ original intent to engage in serious negotiations, as
                            expressed in the opening speeches of the four delegation leaders,
                            remains firm, though <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> may
                            be having difficulty holding this line within his own delegation. Their
                            insistence on a true transfer of power to the African majority during
                            the interim period and, consequently, their opposition to continued
                            Rhodesian control of the sensitive ministries (including Defense, Law
                            and Order, Finance and Information) also remain fixed.</p>
                        <p>4. The British and Rhodesians appear to be hewing closely to their
                            original game plans. The British are still intent on reaching an
                            agreement as close to Annex C as possible, though their original
                            insistence on avoiding a substantive role during the interim period is
                            wavering. The Rhodesians are sticking like adhesive tape to the five
                            points and have not developed any well-thought-out fallback positions.
                            They prefer to let the British force the nationalists to show their
                            cards before revealing their own position further. There is also the
                            lingering hope among the Rhodesians that the nationalists may fail in
                            their attempts to forge a unified position and begin a dissolution
                            process which might prove favorable to further independent initiatives
                            by the Smith regime.</p>
                        <p>5. The obervers have not tried or been able to exercise much control over
                            the nationalist delegations. As a group they seem to often be operating
                            without instructions, perhaps at cross purposes, and with little
                            coordination. Some, certainly <persName corresp="#p_MA_1"
                                >Mogwe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>,
                            stand by their original intention to guide the conference into
                            discussions of matters of principles and institutions, but in
                            confidence, have dejectedly admitted that it will be impossible to avoid
                            issues of personality and more troubling specifics.</p>
                        <p>6. Among the issues which are bubbling to the surface and offer
                            significant potential for further fouling the conference’s progress are
                            the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Structure of the interim government—the Rhodesians’ insistence on a
                            two tier interim government in strict accordance with point <pb n="619"
                                facs="0658" xml:id="pg_619"/>three continues to elicit a negative
                            response from the African delegations. However, no consensus of an
                            alternative structure has emerged from the African side. As Salim, the
                            Tanzanian representative told <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor
                                Richard</persName> on November 11, the nationalists and observers
                            want a one tier government. The Africans want a black majority Council
                            of Ministers to have all real authority and they see no role for the
                            Rhodesia Front. There are indications that while the Africans continue
                            to oppose the Council of State concept as enunciated by Smith, with its
                            implicit white veto, the idea of a body above the Cabinet to referee
                            what will almost surely be fierce black-white and black-black rivalries
                            may prove more acceptable as negotiations wear on. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> has privately floated the idea
                            that the Council of State could serve as an advisory body to a British
                            Governor General. The idea has not taken hold but may be resuscitated in
                            another form. As the British delegation’s legal advisor<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d221fn2">The British delegation’s legal adviser was
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SH_2">Henry Steel</persName>.</note>
                            points out, there is precedent for a “privy council” in colonial
                            governments of transition.</p>
                        <p>B. British responsibility—intertwined with the issue of the structure of
                            the government is the role the British will play in the interim
                            government. Though the nationalist delegations made clear even before
                            the start of the conference their insistence upon Britain resuming its
                            colonial responsibilities in Rhodesia, it is probable that they had
                            little more in mind for the British Governor General than acting as a
                            legitimizing and protective authority. It is possible that the
                            nationalists might be shifting slightly on this issue as their own
                            internal differences become manifest. Their position is still undefined
                            but a growing desire to use the British as a guarantor against Smith’s
                            usurpation of power mandates, at least theoretically, a more substantive
                            role in the political and security process. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> have been in continual contact with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> over the past ten days and
                            have urged a larger and more specific role for the British during the
                            transitional period including, according to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>’s Nov 10 Martha Honey interview, the holding of
                            specific portfolios—Defense and External Affairs. The utility of a
                            meaningful British presence to the nationalists for protection from one
                            another is also obviously an important factor, more so, of course, to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName> than to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName>. These sentiments are counterbalanced by an
                            unspecified uneasiness about possible “British recolonization” of
                            Rhodesia. For their part, the Rhodesian delegation has made it clear
                            that they see no substantive role for Britain during the interim
                            government; they claim to seek a solution which permits Rhodesians—black
                            and white—to work out their future in Rhodesia, free from foreign
                            influence. <persName corresp="#p_GJ_1">Gaylard</persName> said the other
                            day that Rhodesian officers would simply not take orders from a British
                                ap<pb n="620" facs="0659" xml:id="pg_620"/>pointee whether he is a
                            Governor General or an armed forces commander. He argued that Rhodesian
                            Front members will continue to exercise this power during the interim
                            government including the retention of the sensitive security protfolios.
                            Even making allowance for rhetoric, <persName corresp="#p_GJ_1"
                                >Gaylard</persName>’s analysis reflects the current state of
                            Rhodesian thinking.</p>
                        <p>C. Military: Beyond their insistence that the crucial security portfolios
                            be in black hands and that <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss> take
                            control of the security apparatus during the transitional period, there
                            has been no further suggestions from the African side as to how this
                            might be accomplished. The Rhodesians are not even discussing the
                            matter. <persName corresp="#p_GJ_1">Gaylard</persName> darkly assumes
                            “terrorists will be disarmed” as they re-enter Rhodesia. Whether the
                            issue of how the respective armed forces will be dealt with formally
                            surfaces at the conference or not—and in the interest of the
                            conference’s success, it should not—the possibility of internecine
                            fighting between the liberation armies obviously weighs heavily upon
                            some of the nationalists and observers who are haunted by visions of
                            another Angola. Despite his political motives, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> should be taken seriously when he
                            says he is trying to reconstitute <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss>
                            in order to avoid civil war. Implausible as it might appear at first
                            glance, there is a possibility that for reasons of their own, each of
                            the nationalist leaders might, in addition to looking toward Britain for
                            assistance in this field, also modify their attitude toward the
                            Rhodesian army to the point where they might welcome it playing a role
                            in keeping the peace. One perceptive onlooker here asserts that the
                            initial rhetorical vituperation against the Rhodesian military is
                            softening. Even elements in <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName>’s delegation have admitted privately to others
                            that order must be maintained by a disciplined security force as the
                            period of transition begins. At least one <gloss target="#t_ZANU_1"
                                >ZANU</gloss> (<persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>
                            faction) delegation member reports he has less of a problem with white
                            security forces than he would have with Smith’s black units. African
                            thoughts on this topic are of course sitll highly ill-defined and
                            speculative, but as the conference progresses, more attention will be
                            given to how to keep the two black armies and the one white army from
                            each others’ throats during the interim period. A precarious balancing
                            act of the three with some judicious juggling by the British—perhaps
                            backed by the Commonwealth—may eventually prove to be a solution. No
                            specific African proposal on how to integrate liberation forces and
                            divide security responsibility with the Europeans has surfaced since
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> mentioned the
                            possibility of creating a third security ministry.</p>
                        <p>D. The franchise—despite <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                            >Muzorewa</persName>’s early attempt to inject the issue of elections
                            into the conference, no open discussion of the franchise problem has
                            taken place here. It appears that even <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Muzorewa</persName> has backed off his original plan, at least for
                            the present, and the other na<pb n="621" facs="0660" xml:id="pg_621"
                            />tionalist leaders are more than content to continue ducking the issue.
                            The Rhodesians have been warned to avoid bringing up the topic in Geneva
                            and may indeed not do so. There seems to have developed a fairly clear
                            consensus that the composition of the electorate is more appropriate
                            topic for a constitutional conference organized by the interim
                            government. This consensus could however crumble if one or more of the
                            delegations sense a draft in the structuring of the interim government
                            which they view as inimical to their overall strategy and interests.</p>
                        <p>E. Cutting the pie—there are, of course, two conferences going on in
                            Geneva. The more visible one involves the Africans, British and
                            Rhodesians in an attempt to bring majority rule to Rhodesia. The less
                            visible, but perhaps equally important conference involves the black
                            battle for leadership of an independent Zimbabwe. The conflicting
                            ambitions of the four African leaders is reflected in every tactical
                            decision they make. Though it would undoubtedly be to the conference’s
                            benefit to avoid discussion in Geneva of questions of who will assume
                            specific powers in the interim government and, particularly, who will be
                            Prime Minister, it is clear that the African leaders are not so
                            inclined. Each of them continues to view himself as Zimbabwe’s logical
                            first Prime Minister and their delegations agree. Proposals such as the
                            one which would have an apolitical black Rhodesian serve as Prime
                            Minister during the interim government fall like lead balloons for the
                            moment. The Rhodesians seek to avoid making a tough choice by claiming
                            that they cannot think of anyone who might fill the bill—though they
                            wish to split <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>; the nationalists contend that
                            such an individual would not have sufficient authority to lead the
                            country during the difficult transitional period. One observer,
                            Botswanan Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MA_1">Mogwe</persName>,
                            suggests that the British could fulfill the function by designating the
                            Prime Minister, and by dividing the other portfolios equitably among the
                            four groups. However, he offered no hope that the front line states, or
                            more importantly the nationalists, would guarantee to go along with the
                            British decision. In this issue, as in all others, the nationalists seem
                            to be looking to the British to solve those questions they think are
                            impossible to resolve.</p>
                        <p>F. Rhodesia Front role—while the Africans are jockeying amongst
                            themselves for position, the Rhodesian delegation remains firmly
                            committed to propounding its own central role in the interim government.
                            As <persName corresp="#p_GJ_1">Gaylard</persName> expressed this
                            recently, the blacks must realize that the whites, not the British,
                            control power in Rhodesia, and that the Rhodesia Front will continue to
                            exercise that control during the transitional period, and implicitly, in
                            a measurable way in an independent Zimbabwe. This belief in their own
                            centrality has no doubt been increased by their military successes in
                            Mozambique and what is per<pb n="622" facs="0661" xml:id="pg_622"
                            />ceived to be an encouraging shift in Western, and in particular South
                            African public and governmental opinion, toward their favor since the
                            conference’s inception. For their part, the Africans remain implacably
                            distrustful of Smith and his cohort and can be expected to dig their
                            heels in deeply to avoid giving the Rhodesia Front any meaningful power
                            during and beyond the transitional period. Their position may be best
                            reflected in <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>’s November
                            10 statement in Dar that the transitional government should be “a
                            government of national unity, a government of consensus of Africans and
                            whites who are acceptable to the majority of people . . . If I were a
                            Rhodesian nationalist, I would not want a racist to be in my government.
                            I would not mind including whites in an interim government as long as
                            they had all along been against Smith and what Smith stands for.”</p>
                        <p>7. The above enumerated pitfalls are only a few of several that could
                            debilitate the conference. Even wider and more fundamental cleavages
                            separate the basic outlooks of the white and black delegates. One factor
                            favorable to the conference’s ultimate success, however, is a real
                            appreciation on the part of most of the participants, and particularly
                            the old line nationalist political leaders, that this is their last best
                            chance for a negotiated settlement in which their own political
                            aspirations might be served. Nothing that has happened since the outset
                            of the conference has changed that perception.</p>
                        <p>8. To date the United States’ role at the conference has been generally
                            low key and suitable to the nature of the discussions which have taken
                            place. However, given the fact that all of the participants, for
                            disparate reasons, view the United States as a critical player in the
                            negotiations, it is inevitable that pressure will build for more active
                            participation on our part. Botswana’s <persName corresp="#p_MA_1">Archie
                                Mogwe</persName> noted recently, in bemused disappointment, that we
                            have “religiously avoided involvement in the independence date dispute”.
                            Every delegation knows, however, that we believe the principal purpose
                            of the conference is the organization of a government of transition.
                            Assuming the date of independence problem is solved, the conference will
                            have overcome two major hurdles and avoided deadlock and breakdown. As a
                            result, the timing and manner of our involvement will have to be
                            carefully judged. The British, including Richard, continue to be
                            extremely sensitive to any hint we are trying to second guess British
                            management. We have an invitation to join Richard in planning a
                            negotiating strategy to deal with the interim government and we should
                            accept. Tactical decisions concerning our engagement in the other issues
                            of interim government can only be made as the conference’s proceedings
                            bring problems to the fore.</p>

                        <p>Statement by the Chairman</p>
                        <p>This conference has now spent well over a week trying to work out a
                            time-table for bringing independence to Rhodesia. The discussions have
                            been detailed, far-reaching and useful. They have concentrated on the
                            various constitutional and administrative processes which must be
                            completed before independence can be granted. There is an encouraging
                            identity of views both on what these processes are and also—and I stress
                            this—on the fact that independence should take place as soon as they
                            have been completed. But there is a continuing difference of view on how
                            long it will take to complete these procedures. Following upon the
                            discussions of last week and the intensive consultations which we have
                            had since then, the position which we have reached is as follows:</p>
                        <p>We have agreed that the date of independence shall be the date when the
                            necessary constitutional and administrative processes have been
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>We have agreed what those processes are.</p>
                        <p>We have agreed that the carrying out of those processes will be largely
                            the responsibility of the transitional government and that their timing
                            and pace is therefore essentially for the transitional government to
                            determine.</p>
                        <pb n="624" facs="0663" xml:id="pg_624"/>
                        <p>The British Government is pledged to work with the transitional
                            government in this task so as to ensure that the processes are completed
                            at the earliest possible date.</p>
                        <p>On the best judgement we can make of what will be involved, the British
                            Government’s view is that the necessary processes may take up to 15
                            months from the successful conclusion of this conference. We do not
                            think it would be prudent to count, definitely, on their taking less.
                            Therefore, assuming the conference reaches agreement by 30 November
                            1976, Britain will grant independence not later than 15 months from that
                            date, that is to say not later than 1 March 1978.</p>
                        <p>However, the nationalist delegations have expressed the view that the
                            processes can be completed within a year, and probably within nine or
                            ten months. On this basis, assuming a successful conclusion of this
                            conference by 30 November 1976, independence would come by 1 December
                            1977. If the processes are in fact completed within 12 months Britain
                            will grant independence within 12 months.</p>
                        <p>I believe that what I have just said takes this matter as far as we
                            usefully can at this stage. Before I say more, are there any delegations
                            who wish to take the floor? <hi rend="italic">End text.</hi></p>

                            has eroded confidence in the outcome of Geneva and hardened the
                            positions of all participants. My consultations during the past several
                            days have confirmed gloom and un<pb n="625" facs="0664" xml:id="pg_625"
                            />certainty in all quarters. I remain convinced nevertheless that Geneva
                            offers the only viable forum for achieving a Rhodesian settlement. We
                            need to consider acting in London, Africa and here if the participants
                            are to understand how serious the situation is and how strongly we feel
                            a change of style is required. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi></p>
                        <p>1. Before I proceed to Nairobi this evening, I am attempting here to give
                            an appraisal of Geneva proceedings as gleaned from numerous talks, which
                            are likely to continue until departure time about midnight. I have
                            talked with all of the Geneva luminaries except <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJA_1">Chissano</persName> and Salim and have no reason
                            to believe that they would subtract much from the pervasive gloom. As my
                            reports on these meetings indicate, gloom and doom and bleakness prevail
                            in Geneva, ranging from the vitriol of <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> to the soft unreality of <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_1">Mogwe</persName>, but including the sternness of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> and the
                            other-worldliness of <persName corresp="#p_VBPK_1">Van der
                                Byl</persName> and Squires.</p>
                        <p>2. The problem: The British have thus far presided over an incredibly
                            poor conference, but I am no longer certain that the inept performance
                            has been entirely of their own making. In retrospect one can conceive of
                            certain formulations that may have overcome the date problem, but it now
                            seems probable that no matter what Richard said at the beginning, the
                            nationalists to a man were determined to pin down a date, “an act of
                            faith and trust,” as <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> put it
                            to me. Richard has been the victim of his or someone’s bad decision to
                            allow the date issue to erode confidence and prevent movement; of basic
                            London decisions; of Mozambican intrigue; of <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>’s cunning; of the lack of front line
                            cohesiveness; of <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>’s seeming
                            impotency; and of an unyielding and influential (in Geneva at least)
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>. Whatever the causes,
                            Richard is or soon will be at a Geneva impasse. He has not panicked but
                            is considering inchoate schemes which may only deepen his problems. I do
                            not think that he will adjourn the conference sine die, as he was
                            contemplating yesterday, but he is likely to return from London
                                Monday<note n="4" xml:id="d223fn4">November 22.</note> and seek or
                            probably announce a recess for a specific period, barring of course an
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> cave-in. A “recess” is far
                            better than an “adjournment,” but it is not at all clear what he hopes
                            to accomplish during a short recess. Still, as he assesses alternatives,
                            he will have no other choice, largely because he cannot continue talking
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName> factions without arousing
                            intolerable suspicions.</p>
                        <p>3. Even if the date problem is miraculously overcome, the very prolonged
                            discussion of this issue has created uncontrollable dynamics and dimmed
                            prospects for progress on more substantive matters: the <pb n="626"
                                facs="0665" xml:id="pg_626"/>nationalists, particularly the
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> crowd, have run wild;
                            all parties are proceeding as if the Rhodesians were not present in
                            Geneva; there’s an unspoken British assumption that somehow, some way
                            Washington in the end will handle Salisbury and Pretoria; it’s difficult
                            to detect any intention on the part of the nationalists to share power,
                            even unequally, during a transitional government; threats of protracted
                            armed struggle are rife; the observers have become a part of the problem
                            rather than a mechanism for seeking solutions; and I have the uneasy
                            feeling that we are heading for a point when we will be asked to put
                            together and sell to Salisbury and Pretoria an Annex D or E or F.</p>
                        <p>4. The most reasonably contented contingent in Geneva is the Salisbury
                            group. Their dire prediction has been buttressed: you can’t do business
                            with this crowd. And already <persName corresp="#p_VBPK_1">Van der

                                proposed that Smith “should carry out the <persName

                                the plan would “meet stiff opposition” and “urged them to continue

                            better to them, and later, as they court respectability, perhaps even
                                <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName> may be asked to join
                            other “moderates” to carry out “the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> plan.” It won’t work, of course.</p>
                        <p>5. The final element of the problem is the predicted and even projected
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> split. No one doubts that
                            eventually, perhaps even at the formation of a transitional government,
                            this split is likely. What is not known is whether a separation becomes
                            a viable alternative or simply another layer of the problem, for there
                            is still a prevailing attitude among <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName>’s more extreme subordinates that the new Zimbabwe
                            should rise phoenix like from the ashes of Rhodesia to which they set
                            fire. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>’s gyrations help
                            propel along those who wish to travel this bloody trail.</p>
                        <p>6. Date war results. I want to repeat: the casualties of the prolonged
                            wrangle over the date of independence are numerous, and the divisions
                            which have emerged will make the next phase of the conference, if there
                            is one, more difficult to negotiate.</p>
                        <p>7. To the extent that there was ever external support for the conference,
                            it has diminished. On the Africa-wide scene, the fragile consensus among
                            the front line Presidents and their observers in Geneva has been at
                            least temporarily broken and may not reappear except on the basis of <pb
                                n="627" facs="0666" xml:id="pg_627"/>more extreme demands. The
                            Mozambicans first, followed by the Tanzanians, have played separate
                            hands, seemingly never reviewing the bidding, and have forced their
                            colleagues to follow suit. Nigeria, in the person of a clever diplomat
                            operating under Commonwealth cover,<note n="6" xml:id="d223fn6"
                                >Presumably a reference to Eleazar Chukwuemeka Anyaoku, Assistant

                            full-fledged observer of conference business, and its unhelpful
                            influence has already been felt. <persName corresp="#p_CM_2"
                                >Chona</persName>, as I saw yesterday and as the British confirm in
                            detail, has begun to play his own game with little effective discipline
                            being exercised by <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>.
                            Persuaded of <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss>’s importance, the
                            observers have embraced the more extreme, <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName>-spouted militant demands. Undercut by unilateral

                        <p>8. Equally on the external front, it seems to us from this distance that
                            the South African public support for Geneva may have slipped. The South
                            African press over the past two weeks has regularly highlighted black
                            intransigence, and the shift in South African opinion must limit
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s ability to obtain
                            concessions from Smith.</p>
                        <p>9. The British have been bruised and burned by their experience as
                            conference host and chairman. They seem to be more convinced than ever
                            that Geneva under present rules will not produce a settlement and that
                            Britain will be mired in a long, costly and probably inconclusive
                            process. The nationalists’ decision to press Britain at the outset for a
                            clear indication of Britain’s responsibilities has reinforced British
                            fears. The experience of the independence date debate may have taught
                            the more faint hearted among the British that their interests are served
                            by settling to the strongest bidder. Nationalists’ pressures have forced
                            the British to believe that the only way out is through significant
                            concessions to African positions. For the moment they too have all but
                            forgotten that Smith is an actor on the Geneva stage and seem to believe
                            that we can produce Smith and the South Africans on call. They vow that
                            they will die at the altar of Annex C, but they have not convinced me,
                            nor <persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName> all along, that their
                            heart is in the fight. Finally, we must remember that since the Pearce
                            Commission, the British have been blacker than the blacks, and there
                            will be no rush to assume pre-Pearce stances.</p>
                        <p>10. The nationalists’ position has also deteriorated during the debate.
                            “The wild men” have almost succeeded in deadlocking the conference. They
                            know their power. They are aware that intransigence over time will
                            result in substantial front line and other African support. <persName

                            developing among the nationalists at the beginning of the conference has
                            eroded, and growing public exchanges between <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Muzorewa</persName> and the Patriotic Front portend ill for the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>11. Smith could well conclude that he has emerged the victor in this
                            round. His new confidence may mean that he will be more difficult to
                            deal with if negotiations over the interim government commence. Through
                            his restraint in the face of African provocation, Smith probably feels
                            that he has won points with Western and South African opinion. His
                            reported military successes should also serve to increase his
                            confidence. The debate over the independence date has pitted Britain
                            against the nationalists, and Smith may conclude that his leverage with
                            the British is greater than at any time in the past. <persName

                                “<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> package,” was an
                            indication of what Smith has in mind. An earlier date for independence
                            may not bother Smith as much as most Africans think. He cares far more
                            about the power he will exercise in an interim government. In fact, the
                            earlier the date of independence, the more authority he will expect
                            during the transition. Thus, Smith may have concluded that British
                            concessions on the date have played right into his hands.</p>
                        <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Recommendations:</hi> First, I cannot emphasize too
                            much that even if the date issue is resolved, the future course of the
                            conference is likely to be rocky. Any resolution of this issue will at
                            somepoint be accompanied by or accelerate an <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"

                            will be severe. The following are, in my judgment, minimum <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> requirements, some of which resemble
                            biting bullets without teeth:</p>
                        <p>A. Until and unless we conclude that our objectives are unobtainable, the
                            Geneva conference must be preserved. When the British speak of
                            “adjourning and repackaging,” to use a Dennis <persName
                                corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName> phrase, they have no plan in
                            mind and some British may really mean abandoning and cutting losses. It
                            will not be possible in the foreseeable future to put together a new
                            conference if Geneva dissolves. Neither we nor the British will be able
                            to convince <persName corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> or the radicals to reconvene on
                            terms of moderation. Smith and the South Africans will be hard to hook
                            again.</p>
                        <p>B. Still, we need the British, whatever the leverage we must expend in
                            holding them in a rigorous position. While the nationalists and the <pb
                                n="629" facs="0668" xml:id="pg_629"/>front line are now pressing and
                            occasionally vilifying the British, the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss> represents their only fall-back instrument in a
                            transitional government. After more emotion is spent in Geneva, the only
                            arbiter during transition is likely to be the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. Sweet reasonableness no longer seems to be the appropriate message for
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> or even <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>. Further talk about irreversible
                            courses and the avoidance of violence will only result in messages
                            similar to the one from Ibadan. I think that you should write to each
                            and in a rather tough tone to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> point out that he seems to have abandoned the
                            consultative process begun last April with the resultant near collapse
                            of Geneva; at least you would have expected him to be in touch before
                            taking actions which were predictably unhelpful. Soften the tone with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> but leave no doubt
                            that he is playing with fire, the fire of civil war that may engulf him
                            as well as Rhodesia. Neither man should be left to doubt that we are
                            unhappy, disappointed but still willing to work with them if we
                                can.<note n="8" xml:id="d223fn8">See <ref target="#d228">Document

                            that should enter their vocabulary of negotiation. They must understand
                            that intransigence plays into Smith’s hands and sharply reduces our

                        <p>D. While Geneva is not the best place to make an appraisal, I have tried
                            to point out indications of shifts in South African opinion. If we have
                            not, we should take early steps to measure what Geneva has done to

                            stated what it has done to Smith’s representatives. You might ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> to give you a frank
                            account of Pretoria’s thinking.</p>
                        <p>E. At some early date we need to get a tough message to the nationalists,
                            especially <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName>, that we cannot produce
                            Salisbury if they remain intransigent. We have some sense of what sort
                            of interim government they want, but we see no indication that they make
                            any distinction between power sharing and power grabbing.</p>
                        <p>F. We need to work closely with the British in designing next steps.<note

                            front line colleagues and the nationalists act with greater
                            responsibility. You might consider letters to <persName

                            remind them that if a transfer of power is to take place in Rhodesia, a
                            negotiated outcome which involves power sharing during transition is
                            required.</p>

                                Richard</persName> is in London this weekend and will be consulting
                            with Foreign Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> colleagues, and possibly Prime

                            November 22 prior to returning to Geneva for meeting with Patriotic
                            Front that evening. While his consultation is being described as a
                            routine fortnightly report, it is clear that conference is at impasse
                            over issue of independence date and cannot proceed to other issues until
                            this one is disposed of to the satisfaction of both the British (acting
                            through the chairman) and the Patriotic Front. Divisions within the
                            Front between <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> are very great, but there is
                            danger that an effort either to split the two or to carry on
                            negotiations with the other delegations without the Front would risk
                            complete rejection of the process by the important front-line
                            presidents.</p>
                        <p>2. In the gloomy atmosphere of Geneva it appeared at one point that some
                            of the British advisors considered the possibility of adjourning the
                            conference, either indefinitely or for a short period, although the
                            latest indication is that the British may be inclined to send <pb
                                n="631" facs="0670" xml:id="pg_631"/>Richard back with instructions
                            to soldier on with the independence date issue a while longer.</p>
                        <p>3. The British probably have no clear plan for solving the current issue
                            or dealing with the situation that will result if it cannot be solved.
                            While we wish to keep abreast of their thinking and share with them our
                            own thoughts and concerns, we do not want them to feel we are pressing
                            them to adopt a particular position on the independence date, which is
                            an issue affecting the British role and British political sensitivities.
                            Nonetheless, in view of the obvious problem at hand, we believe it
                            important to express our concerns and explore certain questions with
                            them at this time.</p>
                        <p>4. Accordingly you are instructed to get in touch with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RE_1"

                                >Palliser</persName> in the <gloss target="#t_FCO_1">FCO</gloss> and
                            say you have been asked to seek an appointment if possible to consult
                            jointly with them and Mr. Richard to exchange views on the conference
                            and any steps we should be taking to keep the negotiating process going.
                            In so doing you should use the following talking points.</p>
                        <p>A—We admire the skill and patience with which the chairman has handled
                            the troublesome issue of an independence date.</p>
                        <p>B—It has been our hope that this issue could be bypassed so that the
                            conference could move on to the business of arranging a transitional
                            government which would provide the mechanism by which the transfer of
                            power, establishment of majority rule, and independence would be made
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>C—The approach which the nationalists, particularly the Patriotic Front,
                            have taken on the independence date illustrates the problem of taking
                            one issue at a time and being forced to settle each point before moving
                            on. If the procedure continues to be followed further blow-ups will be
                            inevitable.</p>
                        <p>D—If it is possible, we believe the best strategy is to keep all issues
                            open until nearer the end of the conference, when the time comes to put
                            a final package together. That way one maintains opportunities for
                            negotiating trade-offs between different positions on different
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>E—How can we convey the wisdom of this negotiating approach to the
                            delegations in Geneva?</p>
                        <p>F—We note that the Patriotic Front has mentioned elections in their
                            latest statement about an independence date. This raises the danger of
                            the nationalists opening up another extraneous debate on a single issue
                            before getting to the substance of a transitional government, since the
                            organization of elections, including the franchise, is one of the
                            important and difficult questions that the transitional government is to
                            deal with. We hope the nationalists will not insist on discussing these
                            constitutional questions before agreeing on a transitional government,
                            or there will never be a transition.</p>
                        <pb n="632" facs="0671" xml:id="pg_632"/>
                        <p>G—We are concerned, as we know you must be, that the present impasse does
                            not force a break-up or even adjournment of the Geneva conference.</p>
                        <p>H—We believe that adjournment would run the risk of handing initiative
                            over to the more radical front line leaders who will encourage return to
                            the conference table, if at all, only after they have worked out a
                            package of nearly unconditional surrender terms that neither Smith could
                            accept nor the South Africans support. And without some hope of the
                            latter two elements, negotiations become impossible and escalating
                            warfare inevitable.</p>
                        <p>I—In order to keep the conference going we wonder if we should seek to
                            point out to key front line presidents that adjournment over the
                            independence date issue will be more damaging to the African cause than
                            to Smith. In this connection we are prepared to send Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> again, although <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> and through him, <persName corresp="#p_MS_2"
                                >Machel</persName>, may be the most difficult and important to
                            convince.</p>
                        <p>J—Should we not, perhaps, reiterate that Smith accepted <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>’s outside time of two years
                            and so did the front line presidents? Within that framework, Smith has
                            already accepted the goal of majority rule, leaving for negotiation only
                            the question of how and exactly when, within the time he accepted, this
                            was to be accomplished.</p>
                        <p>K—Adjournment over the issue of an independence date strikes us as
                            potentially more damaging than over substantive issues involved in
                            reaching agreement on a transitional government.</p>
                        <p>L—We believe that none of the delegation leaders who are currently
                            negotiating in Geneva will have an opportunity to play a role in future
                            Zimbabwean government if the present conference breaks up or adjourns
                            without an early resumption.</p>

                        <p>1. We were unable to arrange for the Ambassador to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName> November 22 because of
                            conflicting schedules. Minister and Embassy officer, therefore, called
                            on Ted Rowlands who was joined by <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor
                                Richard</persName> and Philip Mansfield. The three had just emerged
                            from a long session on Rhodesia with the Foreign Secretary.</p>
                        <p>2. We made the points in our instructions, emphasizing the dangers we
                            foresee in an adjournment of the conference and saying that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> is prepared to see <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> again. We also stressed the concern that, if the
                            obstacle of the independence date can be surmounted, the conference
                            should proceed to negotiate a package for the transition and that the
                            package should keep distinct those functions which are the
                            responsibility of Geneva from those which are the responsibility of the
                            interim government.</p>
                        <p>3. Richard took the lead in responding. He said there were two immediate
                            considerations affecting the British stance on the independence date
                            issue. First, Parliament would simply not accept a formula for Rhodesian
                            independence which did not provide for elections. Second, if Britain is
                            to follow the pattern of previous decolonization processes as the front
                            line presidents are insisting—then the procedure Britain is now
                            following is the traditionally proper course. We asked if the British
                            had considered getting off the independence date issue by instead
                            setting a firm date for elections. <persName corresp="#p_RE_1"
                                >Rowlands</persName> said they had just discussed this possibility
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName> and that Richard
                            would be prepared to put forward that idea in Geneva at the right time
                            if necessary.</p>
                        <p>4. Richard then described the political considerations which seem to
                            dominate British thinking on the date question. The issue itself, he
                            said, is getting less important than the struggle now going on within
                            the Patriotic Front. A crunch between <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>
                            was bound to come sooner or later, and sooner is probably better. It is
                            important that <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> win this
                            unfolding showdown with <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>,
                            Richard said. Although it is difficult to get “a good feel for this war
                            of nerves,” the <pb n="634" facs="0673" xml:id="pg_634"/>British have
                            received signals that their firmness on the issue is helping <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> assert his authority within the
                            Front. If <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> gives the private
                            impression that he wants the British to remain firm, they will; if
                            relaxing the British stand will benefit <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nkomo</persName>, Richard is ready to go more in the direction of a
                            definite date, perhaps using a formula which calls for elections by
                            January 1, 1978 leading to independence by March 1. In any event, the
                            British are prepared to play the independence date issue flexibly in
                            whatever manner is most advantageous for <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nkomo</persName> vis-à-vis <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. Richard said that he expects to tie up the date question within the
                            next day or two. If he fails to do so, the British will call for a short
                            adjournment of perhaps ten or fourteen days. Asked if adjournment would
                            not in fact work against <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>
                            rather than for him, Richard answered somewhat vaguely that <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> would use the adjournment to
                            organize people who would then put pressure on <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RE_1"
                                >Rowlands</persName> added that if the conference is bogged down on
                            the date issue, a temporary adjournment would be the only way to break
                            the impasse. He then said that if the issue is resolved by specifying a
                            date for elections, the US might have to put pressure on Smith to accept
                            the agreement or at least note it and move on to other points.</p>
                        <p>6. Richard and <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName> reacted
                            positively to a <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>
                            mission to Lusaka and Dar es Salaam. Both agreed that some “gentle
                            disapproval” expressed by the U.S. to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> “would do no harm”. Richard said he had no good
                            explanation for <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>’s
                            about-face on the independence date other than the unhelpful influence
                            of the Nigerians.</p>
                        <p>7. Richard said he fully intended to proceed with the remainder of the
                            conference on a package basis. He plans to solicit ideas from each
                            delegation on the whole structure of an interim government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>, he understands, is already
                            working on detailed proposals. When all plans have been put to the
                            British, Richard will then devote one day to discussions with each of
                            the delegations followed by a plenary session to discuss the basic
                            issues. Ultimately, he said, when all views have been aired, he will
                            table something similar to Annex C.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName> said the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> is entirely conscious of keeping
                            separate those issues which ought to be taken up in Geneva and those
                            which should be left to the interim government. He nevertheless fears
                            that any discussion of elections, even in the context of setting a date
                            of independence, could lead to a discussion of franchise. It will be
                            difficult to prevent the nationalists from introducing one-man, one-vote
                            as a definition of elections, he said. The British will insist, however,
                            that franchise falls within the purview of the interim government.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Richard is going back to Geneva with
                            his confidence intact and with the immediate tactical goal of playing

                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>’s position. If the date
                            issue cannot be resolved, however, the British have already decided on
                            adjournment as the next best move.</p>

                        <p>1. The Patriotic Front called on <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor
                                Richard</persName> at 6:30 p.m. local time on November 26 to say
                            they would accept the latest British formula for settling the date of
                            independence if the British would agree to two minor modifications. The
                            British, after looking at the changes, accepted. <persName

                            colleague, suggested that minutes be drawn up and agreed to.</p>

                        <p>Quote: Having consulted a number of delegations, I have found a general
                            wish for the conference to set itself a target date for the successful
                            conclusion of its work. I have therefore decided to organize the
                            remainder of the work of the conference, in consultation with the other
                            delegations, in such a way as to finish by 20 December 1976. So far as
                            the British Government are concerned, fixing that target date will not
                            prejudice the date of independence. It is the British Government’s firm
                            position that all the agreed processes in Rhodesia will be completed in
                            time to enable independence to be granted by 1 March 1978. The British
                            Government therefore fix 1 March 1978 as the latest date by which
                            Rhodesia will become independent, and on this basis independence could
                            come even by December 1, 1977. Before the conclusion of the conference
                            and after agreeing on the establishment of the interim gov<pb n="636"
                                facs="0675" xml:id="pg_636"/>ernment, the conference will revert to
                            the question of fixing a date for independence so that a firm date can
                            be agreed upon. Unquote.</p>
                        <p>3. Richard then suggested that the Front join without delay in
                            discussions of the formation of an interim government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> demurred and said that he would
                            need more time. In the course of the conversation, which lasted almost
                            an hour, <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> refused to state
                            his reasons for needing more time and hinted that there might be other
                            matters which required discussion before interim government talks could
                            begin. At one point he suggested “the way we do business” might have to
                            be discussed. He also said he was expecting unnamed visitors from
                            Africa. Both he and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>
                            disingenuously told Richard they had been so preoccupied with the
                            question of the dates that they had not had time to study fully the
                            chairman’s note on the interim government.<note n="3" xml:id="d226fn3"

                                to the delegations requested a meeting with each head of delegation
                                to discuss the form and structure of the interim government, the

                        <p>4. Under pressure from Richard, <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> reluctantly allowed he would attend a bilateral
                            meeting on November 29. Asked how he would spend the weekend, <persName

                        <p>5. The exchange with <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> over
                            next steps left the British quite uneasy. It was not clear whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> was being difficult in
                            order to save face or whether he seriously plans to raise extraneous
                            issues like the conference’s work program or the franchise. Quite
                            possibly <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>’s visitors
                            include <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss> figures from Mozambique
                            and he will need to renew his mandate and plan his strategy with them

                            concept with you during my first meetings with you in September, but
                            there were four preceding missions, American and British, which had
                            already discussed with you the basic structure of the proposed interim
                            government. While there may have been some questions concerning the
                            composition of the interim government, especially of the Council of
                            State, the concept of a sharing of power on the basis of a two-tier
                            system was never challenged. In addition, I want to stress that at no
                            time was there any suggestion that there should be an immediate transfer
                            of power to majority rule. This had never been a consideration in our
                            discussions, and it could not have been because it is not workable or
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>—It is important to remember what the exercise we are engaged in at
                            Geneva is all about. We are in Geneva to try to reach a settlement that
                            transfers power in Rhodesia from the hands of whites who now hold it to
                            Africans who rightfully deserve it.</p>
                        <p>—We are in Geneva to get a solution that offers the rest assurance of a
                            smooth transition to a moderate and responsible government, one that can
                            bring stability and prosperity to Zimbabwe, and one that would not pose
                            a threat to the stability of its neighbors, most notably Zambia.</p>
                        <p>—We are disturbed by what we perceive to be a growing sense of unreality
                            in Geneva, not only among some of the nationalist delegations, but also
                            among the observers.</p>
                        <p>—Somehow, there appears an increasing tendency to ignore some of the
                            fundamental realities of the Rhodesian situation:</p>
                        <p>—The first of these realities is that <persName corresp="#p_SID_1">Ian
                                Smith</persName> and the Rhodesia Front hold de facto power in
                            Rhodesia, not the South Africans, not the British, and certainly not the
                            United States. No matter how much we may dislike that situation, it is
                            not something that can be wished away.</p>
                        <p>—The second, there are limitations on the degree of influence that
                            external powers can effectively exercise, especially for a settlement
                            that does not insure minority rights.</p>
                        <p>—The third point concerns those understandings which persuaded Smith to
                            accept, for the first time in his 12 years in power, the principle of
                            majority rule and the implementation of that principle within a fixed
                            time frame. Whatever one chooses to say about the five points of Smith’s
                            Sept. 24 speech, and particularly point 3, there can be <pb n="639"
                                facs="0678" xml:id="pg_639"/>no disagreement over the fact that they
                            were understood to form the basis for negotiations.<note n="5"

                            They can be altered in the course of a negotiation but they can not
                            simply be discarded in toto. Nor can there be any argument over the fact
                            that the concept that underlies the five points and that made possible
                            Smith’s acceptance of them—as well as that of his party—is the concept
                            that Rhodesian whites would be assured of a meaningful voice and role in
                            the political decisions in the transition period that will affect their
                            future in Zimbabwe. Moreover, the five points in concept were discussed
                            repeatedly with the front line presidents before they were put
                            forward.</p>
                        <p>—We have heard the view expressed by several persons in Geneva that Smith
                            and the Rhodesia Front may now be ready to abandon the concept of shared
                            power in the interim government in exchange for vague and ambiguous
                            promises or understandings. We have also heard it said that the United
                            States can deliver Smith upon demand and get him to accept any
                            alternative set of proposals that might be put forward at the
                            conference. With regard to the first point, nothing Smith has said or
                            implied since the opening of the conference offers any suggestion that
                            he is prepared to abandon the concept that Rhodesia whites must have
                            effective and clearly defined powers within the interim government. With
                            regard to the second, anyone who thinks that we can persuade or coerce
                            Smith into accepting a settlement on terms that do not even take account
                            of the five points fails to understand the situation.</p>
                        <p>—Our assessment is that Smith and the Rhodesians are fully prepared to
                            fight on and to resist all forms of pressure if they do not get the kind
                            of settlement that they feel meets their minimum requirements. We are
                            especially concerned about the very evident erosion of support in South
                            Africa for a settlement, which could tie <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>’s hands and prevent him from continuing his
                            positive contributions not only with respect to Zimbabwe but also
                            Namibia.</p>
                        <p>—If there is no settlement, it is not the United States that will suffer
                            most directly from the consequences of that failure. Those who will
                            suffer most will be the Zimbabweans, who face the prospect of having a
                            whole generation of youth chewed up in needless bloodshed, and whose
                            only reward will be a country ravaged by war and destruction.</p>
                        <p>—Zambia would pay a heavy price if the war is allowed to drag on, and not
                            merely in economic terms. Zambia already knows what it means to have
                            foreign armies living in armed camps on its soil and how difficult it
                            can be to control them. The Lebanese experience stands as an example to
                            all of how disruptive a force these armies can become.</p>
                        <pb n="640" facs="0679" xml:id="pg_640"/>
                        <p>—You must also understand that if continuing violence leads to foreign
                            intervention, the United States cannot ignore it.</p>
                        <p>—We can understand your concern of <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss>
                            and your desire not to provide those who wish to see the conference fail
                            with the excuse they are looking for. But we fail to comprehend how
                            Zambia’s interests, or Zimbabwe’s either, would be served by a solution
                            that merely places power in the hands of the militants without imposing
                            any discipline or restraint on the exercise of that power.</p>
                        <p>—Nor do we understand the argument for giving in to <gloss
                                target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss>’s demand for instant majority rule,
                            which seems to us to be contrary to Zambia’s own interests, and which
                            will also destroy any chance of getting a settlement.</p>
                        <p>—Transition means just that, not an instantaneous and total reversal of
                            existing power relationships but an irreversible movement towards it in
                            a limited span of time. Obviously Smith will have more power at the
                            beginning of the transition than at the end.</p>
                        <p>—The United States is committed to a solution that results in the
                            effective transfer to the African majority by the end of that already
                            agreed interim period. For a solution to be acceptable to us, it must
                            also be a solution that can be supported by the front line presidents
                            and sold to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. In other words,
                            Zimbabwe’s victory is assured, and any talk about a second <gloss
                                target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss> is baseless and absurd. We will oppose
                            any such move sharply and can count on South African support in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>—However flawed the institutional arrangements outlined in the five
                            points may appear, we must remember that they were the basis on which
                            Smith was hooked into the process of surrendering his own position and
                            power.</p>
                        <p>—The name of the game is to keep him hooked and not make it possible for
                            him to wiggle off.</p>
                        <p>—There is a lot the British can do to make the structure of the interim
                            government function more smoothly and effectively. We believe they are
                            prepared to play a role, and we are prepared to push them in that
                            direction. But we cannot expect the British to assume responsibilities
                            in Rhodesia that they have never had and for which they lack the
                            authority to back them up. They are willing to bridge the gap, but you
                            must be very precise and very realistic about what you expect of them.
                            They can provide the additional margin of assurance for both sides; but
                            in the final analysis, the British role cannot take the place of a basic
                            agreement among the parties themselves which defines in clear and
                            unambiguous terms the powers that each will exercise in the interim
                            period.</p>
                        <p>—Throughout the course of our common effort to find a settlement, no
                            nation has had clearer vision than Zambia. No nation has a <pb n="641"
                                facs="0680" xml:id="pg_641"/>greater stake in a successful outcome,
                            one that brings a moderate, pragmatic and responsible government to
                            Zimbabwe. We believe that other nations will recognize and accept the
                            fact that Zambia faces greater risks than anyone else if our efforts
                            fail; and as a result, we believe that your word will be needed and
                            accepted by the other front line presidents and by African leaders
                            generally. It is up to Zambia, being closest to the problem, to remind
                            the others of how dangerous the situation can become if a settlement
                            based on compromise is not achieved.</p>
                        <p>—It is important that the Patriotic Front rethink its position and
                            negotiate proposals which provide for power sharing with Rhodesian
                            Europeans during the period of transition.</p>
                        <p>—The framework which the Patriotic Front appears to be advancing does not
                            meet this criteria and cannot, therefore, enjoy our support.</p>
                        <p>—I apologize for the length of this letter but I consider it important at
                            this delicate phase of the negotiations that we analyze carefully and
                            fully what is involved. I trust that you will use your influence to
                            bring the Patriotic Front around to a more realistic approach. If you
                            succeed, you can count on us to work behind the scenes with the other
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>—I look forward to hearing from you. Warmest regards, <persName

                            Conference: Results of Richard’s Consultations in London.</p>
                        <p>1. I called on Richard this afternoon to find out what happened in London
                            and what decisions were reached. Richard was accompanied by Robin Byatt
                            and Robin Young. He said that his guidelines from London called for him
                            to finish out this week of consultations with the various delegations in
                            order to clarify as much as possible their views <pb n="642" facs="0681"
                                xml:id="pg_642"/>and positions. Richard will also try to test
                            Smith’s willingness to accept a new framework which would allow him to
                            stay in the game. This will allow London time to draw up a range of
                            options with regard to British responsibilities in the interim
                            government which will then be presented to the Secretary and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> this weekend. Richard will be
                            present for the talks in London.</p>
                        <p>2. If the Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>
                            conclude that the conference cannot be held together during the next
                            week while the parties, including the front line presidents and South
                            Africa are sold on a new package of British responsibilities, then
                            Richard would return to Geneva next week and adjourn the conference for
                            the Christmas period. During that time, we and the British would try to
                            sell a new package, based on expanded British involvement, in Africa and
                            then would try to reconvene the conference. (We understand separately
                            that the package of options on British responsibilities being prepared
                            in Whitehall will be sent info to Washington.)</p>
                        <p>3. Richard told me in strictest confidence and asked that we hold the
                            information closely, that <persName corresp="#p_CA_1"
                                >Crosland</persName> believes the mandate he has received from the
                            Cabinet is broad enough to develop whatever degree of British
                            responsibility may be necessary, and he would not need to return to the
                            Cabinet for a decision. Military involvement is, of course, not in the
                            mandate.</p>
                        <p>4. Richard does not think he can carry the conference through next week
                            without a new negotiating framework. The nationalists, he said, are
                            predisposed to a recess, particularly <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                                >Nkomo</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Muzorewa</persName> who would like to adjourn this week. Both want
                            to campaign at home. The British understand that it will not be easy to
                            put Geneva back together following a recess. They recognize that
                            nationalist demands may escalate and positions harden but British do not
                            see that they have many choices.</p>
                        <p>5. Immediate prospects depend on Smith’s attitude, which Richard will
                            begin to probe this evening in a quiet, private session. I urged Richard
                            to find any way possible to convince Smith that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> is sympathetic to his problems and to
                            overcome some of the suspicion, verging on hostility, that has developed
                            between Smith’s delegation and the British. Richard said he would
                            consider the suggestion but stressed that if Smith insisted on
                            continuing his public attacks on the British, he could not expect any
                            improvement in the treatment he receives in return. Neither we nor the
                            British have any indication of Smith’s plans and even his own delegation
                            is very much in the dark. At present, the only indication we have is
                            what the press is carrying, which contains both positive and negative
                            signals. While reiterating that he regards the five points as a firm
                            contract, Smith indicated some possible flexibility by saying upon
                            departing Salisbury, that “we have <pb n="643" facs="0682"
                                xml:id="pg_643"/>to keep ourselves in a position where we can move
                            and play things off the cuff.”</p>
                        <p>6. Richard said that if Smith sticks to his so-called “contract”, the
                            conference will be in dire peril and even a new package would not make
                            any new difference. He reiterated what he had said to Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>, that Annex
                            C, for all intents and purposes, is dead. He would be reluctant to
                            propose to <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName> that the
                            British try to table a package of <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            responsibilities until they have had a chance to get some indication
                            from the Africans and South Africans that such a package might be
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>7. When I asked Richard about the current mood in London concerning the
                            talks, he replied that in general the attitude was good, principally
                            because the British had finally become comfortable with the idea that it
                            would take a more active British role if a settlement is to be achieved.
                            He noted that many had not expected the conference to get as far as it
                            has. Not only has the conference held together, but the parties have
                            spelled out their positions in clear detail and we now have a better
                            assessment of where the gaps lie and what will be necessary to bridge
                            them. The gaps remain wide and it is clear that the nature of <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> involvement will have to be much
                            greater, to include voting participation in a body like the Council of
                            State and perhaps a tie breaking role in the Council of Ministers as
                            well. Some <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> involvement in the
                            security aspects would also have to be contemplated. But he believes the
                            British by and large are better prepared to accept such responsibilities
                            now than at any time since the negotiations began.</p>

                        <p>“Dear Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>,</p>
                        <p>Thank you for so quickly following up on my discussions with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> in your letter of
                            7th December—and indeed for sending him to Dar es Salaam in the first
                            place.</p>
                        <p>Until early in September I was urging the British Government ‘to do
                            nothing until there has been time for the pressures of guerrilla warfare
                            and sanctions to deliver Smith to London’. I persistently argued that
                            Smith cannot be begin underline converted, end underline he can only be
                            begin underline forced end underline to accept majority rule. Thus, for
                            example, on 28th August, I had two meetings with your emissaries.<note

                                    >RG</gloss> 59, Central Foreign Policy Files)</note> I called
                            for the second meeting to make quite sure that they understood that I
                            was asking the U.S.A. and the U.K. to ‘do nothing’ about Rhodesia until
                            guerrilla pressures, the sanctions, and now the declared American policy
                            in favour of majority rule, had forced Smith to face reality. On 29th
                            August I argued the same case to the British emissaries.</p>
                        <p>But the British argued that the situation had changed, because a new
                            factor had emerged. That new factor was American power. They mapped out
                            a scenario which could follow: Smith would fall, a caretaker government
                            would take over, and that caretaker government would announce the
                            acceptance of the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> terms
                            for a Rhodesia settlement.</p>
                        <p>There was no misunderstanding between us. I received a message from you
                            dated 1st September.<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">Transmitted in telegram

                            following: ‘You are aware of the framework I propose for a settlement.
                            It involves (A) the withdrawal of the present government in favour of a

                            constitution which includes basic protection for minority rights; (C)
                            full independence under majority rule in 18 months, two years, or
                            earlier.’ Then on 3rd September I received your response<note n="5"

                            nothing’ message. It says, inter alia, ‘I have just received the message
                            that you asked be passed to me. I have carefully considered the points
                            you made and appreciate your reasons for saying that you need more time
                            to prepare the ground for a Rhodesian settlement. You have asked that
                            nothing be undertaken with respect to Rhodesia until conditions are

                        <p>That then, was my position until early in September. I changed. I changed
                            because, and only because, of the British and American insist<pb n="645"
                                facs="0684" xml:id="pg_645"/>ence that the American entry on to the
                            Rhodesian scene in support of majority rule provided what was lacking
                            before—i.e. power. For America represents power; I know this as well as
                            Smith does. But even when we met on 15th September<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d230fn6">See <ref target="#d204">Document 204</ref>.</note>
                            I was still worried, and again expressed my concern about Smith’s
                            capacity to survive, together with his minority rule. You reassured me
                            with the words ‘yes, but he has never been up against the U.S. before’.
                            And you went on to say in effect (I do not have your actual words) that
                            what you had in mind was to get <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> to get rid of Smith and then the new man would
                            accept the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName>
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>You saw <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> and Smith<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d230fn7">See <ref target="#d206">Document
                                206</ref>.</note> and I became confident that you had ‘pulled it
                            off’. For although you had decided that Smith should himself be forced
                            to say that he accepted majority rule, it was still obvious from his
                            broadcast that he had accepted it only because he had no alternative; he
                            was confronted with American and Western power. So American power was
                            being used in support of majority rule.</p>
                        <p>With this background you will appreciate why I feel slightly irritated to
                            find now that Smith’s power, together with American, British, and South
                            African combined ‘powerlessness’, is being advanced as the reason why
                            the front-line states must ask the nationalists to abandon their
                            legitimate demands.</p>
                        <p>For let me repeat: I changed my approach in early September because I had
                            been brought to believe (as I have continued to believe until now) that
                            American power would be brought to bear, and maintained as long as
                            necessary, in support of a transfer of power from the minority in
                            Rhodesia. This support was limited in action to support for a transfer
                            by peaceful means; but it was still without question support for a
                            definite transfer of power to the majority. It has been on that basis
                            that my colleagues and I have been acting from September until now. But
                            after receiving your letter yesterday I am now a little worried that
                            this U.S. commitment is being reconsidered. I hope I am wrong, and that
                            such a worry is without foundation.</p>
                        <p>When we met on 15th September,<note n="8" xml:id="d230fn8">See <ref
                                    target="#d204fn1">Document 204 and footnote 1</ref>
                                thereto.</note> we were talking in terms of a solution in Rhodesia
                            without Smith. I specifically said that I liked the American suggestions
                            that Smith would be pressured to resign, and that an interim government
                            would be worked out between the nationalists and a caretaker government.
                            I was, however, pessimistic about the chances; and you did mention
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s idea that Smith
                            should be the one to announce acceptance of majority rule. But whoever
                            accepted <pb n="646" facs="0685" xml:id="pg_646"/>the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> proposals, I stressed that
                            the rest of us should keep out once the negotiations had started; that
                            we cannot deal with the details—although I did add that the “Council of
                            State” you mentioned would not be acceptable to the nationalists.</p>
                        <p>After you had seen <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> and
                            Smith you outlined your ideas, and what you thought you had
                                achieved.<note n="9" xml:id="d230fn9">They met on September 21; see
                                    <ref target="#d207fn3">footnote 3, Document 207</ref>.</note>
                            Frankly, I ignored the details; I had always insisted that details must
                            be left to the conference. I certainly did not realise that you were
                            committed to a Council of State which would be supreme, and to white
                            ministers for Defence and Law and Order. I thought these matters would
                            be the subject of negotiation. What I was happy about was your statement
                            that Smith had accepted independence on the basis of majority rule in
                            two years, and a conference to work out the interim government, although
                            you will remember that I doubted the procedures, and said that the
                            nationalists could not meet Smith in Rhodesia. It seemed to me then that
                            Smith had realised that he could not withstand American power on top of
                            the other pressures on his regime.</p>
                        <p>Smith’s broadcast was a shock to me.<note n="10" xml:id="d230fn10">See
                                    <ref target="#d209">Document 209</ref>.</note> But I was
                            concerned to save what I regarded as your achievement. This is, his
                            commitment to accepting independence on the basis of majority rule in
                            two years, and to negotiations about an interim government. It was for
                            that reason that my colleagues and I urged the British to take over the
                            arrangements, and to call a conference themselves. We accepted Geneva
                            rather than London as a compromise; we accepted the absence of a British
                            minister in the chair as a second compromise. For our purpose was, and
                            is, to use that conference to get an interim government; that is, one
                            which would, in your own words, provide ‘a transition during which the
                            whites could adjust to the changes taking place and either be assured of
                            their personal safety and well-being or withdraw’.</p>
                        <p>But, as I thought you had understood very early in our discussions, there
                            could be no question of Smith or the white minority controlling Rhodesia
                            during that interim period. In my letter to you of 5th October<note

                            again that a transfer of power by easy stages is not possible in 1976.
                            The nationalists cannot share power with the Rhodesia Front; many of
                            them have spent ten years in Smith’s jails and their friends and
                            colleagues have been ‘executed’ by his illegal regime. Too many previous
                            attempts to settle this matter peacefully have been manoeuvred by Smith
                            into serving the strengthening of his cause. The nationalists are very
                            suspicious. So am I. I have been working actively <pb n="647"
                                facs="0686" xml:id="pg_647"/>for <gloss target="#t_NIMBAR_1"
                                >NIBMAR</gloss>—majority rule before independence—since 1964, and
                            have watched Smith out-manoeuvre the British, the international
                            community, and finally myself and my colleagues, when each of us in turn
                            thought we had got him to agree to a phased transfer of power. I warned
                            that he would use another conference for the same purpose; and there is
                            plenty of evidence that he is doing just that.</p>
                        <p>The nationalists and the front-line states do accept the principle of an
                            interim government, in which adjustments can be made by individuals
                            affected. That is why, despite our many disagreements with the British
                            Government about Rhodesia in the past, we are demanding that the British
                            Government should participate in the interim government. I do know why
                            Smith and <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> have always
                            been opposed to British participation—even in a constitutional
                            conference. They believe that Britain is now committed to <gloss
                                target="#t_NIMBAR_1">NIBMAR</gloss>. But I do not understand your
                            own opposition to British participation.</p>
                        <p>The first of our two reasons for insisting upon active British
                            involvement is a legal one. During the transition period Rhodesia is not
                            independent. There are certain functions which will belong to Britain as
                            the sovereign state. Those ‘residual powers’ are defence, external
                            affairs, and constitutional affairs. If Britain does not exercise those
                            powers during the interim, who would exercise them on her behalf?</p>
                        <p>The second reason is political. You had apparently agreed that Defence,
                            and Law and Order, should be under the control of the Smith forces. This
                            is clearly not acceptable to the nationalists—it could not be. But in
                            all these matters one must try to find a compromise. The possible
                            compromise is that Defence (but not Law and Order) could be held by a
                            white minister who is appointed by Britain in consultation with the
                            Prime Minister. This would be done by the British ‘Resident
                            Commissioner’. But if Britain does not agree to accept responsibility
                            for these residual powers, how do you compromise on the demand that
                            Defence be held by a nationalist without leaving it in the hands of the
                            supporters of minority rule?</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that the person appointed by Britain to be ‘Resident
                            Commissioner’ would have to be someone the nationalists can work with;
                            it would be no use appointing <persName corresp="#p_BP_1"
                                >Patrick</persName> Wall or Enoch Powell. But I do not understand
                            why you say that the British official representative would be chosen
                            primarily by the nationalists and dismissed at their will. I have never
                            heard that suggested by anyone until now.</p>
                        <p>To avoid continued misunderstanding let me also make it clear that no
                            one, to my knowledge, has suggested that there should be no whites in
                            the interim government, apart from this British participation of a kind
                            that all ex-British colonies are familiar with in the last stages before
                            independence. As I have said to you before, I expect—and I know the
                            nationalists do—that it will be necessary to be so far racial in <pb
                                n="648" facs="0687" xml:id="pg_648"/>the interim government as to
                            ensure that there are some white ministers. But they will be in a
                            minority; and they will have to be people who are committed to Zimbabwe,
                            not to minority rule in that country. I am confident that white
                            Rhodesians do exist to whom these things are acceptable, and who
                            recognise that anything else is impossible after the experience of the
                            past eleven years.</p>
                        <p>So what is the difference between us? The conference at Geneva is proving
                            even more difficult than I had anticipated. But it could still succeed,
                            provided that full pressure is kept upon Smith and his minority regime.
                            If, however, there is still a reality in the possibility of Smith
                            getting outside support, either from South Africa or from America, then
                            it will fail. Because Smith will make it fail. And then there will be no
                            other recourse except guerrilla war until the end, regardless of the
                            effect on the front-line states. You ask me whether we can control their
                            source of arms. They have no choice. They will continue to get them from
                            the Communists.</p>
                        <p>We are committed to independence on the basis of majority rule. For the
                            sake of a peaceful transfer of power, and an end to the horrors and
                            political dangers of war, the nationalists and the front-line states are
                            prepared to accept an interim arrangement even at this date. But it has
                            to be one which marks a transfer of power from the minority in such a
                            way that they can never recover it.</p>
                        <p>Believe me, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>, I do
                            appreciate your desire to see this conference brought to a successful
                            conclusion quickly. I too get impatient at the way it is dragging on.
                            But what matters is not the manoeuvring, but the ultimate success, and I
                            think we must be prepared for day-to-day frustrations and
                            disappointments. If it does finally succeed, the initiative you took
                            will be vindicated. If, unfortunately, it does not succeed, and that
                            failure cannot be attributed to a withdrawal of pressure on Smith, than
                            your initiative will still have been a brave and historic attempt.</p>
                        <p>Let me now turn briefly to the question of Namibia.</p>
                        <p>Here it may be that we have got into a communications muddle. In your
                            letter of 4th October,<note n="12" xml:id="d230fn12">Transmitted in
                                telegram 246530 to Dar es Salaam, October 4. (Ibid.)</note> when you
                            said that the Windhoek conference would only send a representative
                            delegation to a conference at Geneva, you also said that you would take
                            no further action until you heard from my colleagues and myself. But I
                            was under the impression that we had cleared this matter up through my
                            discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SJW_1"
                                >Spain</persName>, and that you were going to ask Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> to call a conference which we
                            would get <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> to attend. Now, in
                            your letter of 7th December, you say that this is not good enough
                            because of <persName corresp="#p_NSD_1">Sam <pb n="649" facs="0688"
                                    xml:id="pg_649"/>Nujoma</persName>’s pre-conditions. These, as I
                            understand it, are that he should be assured that the people he needs on
                            his delegation will be released from South African controlled prisons,
                            and that he would be negotiating with South Africa as the de facto
                            government of Namibia, and the U.N. as the de jure government. But there
                            is nothing new in this? These are the same conditions we talked about
                            twice in September. So I have to ask what new thing is it that you feel
                            is necessary as a result of the ‘problems we have run into at Geneva’? I
                            cannot consider whether there is anything more we can do to help until I
                            understand the problem myself.</p>
                        <p>Is the problem still the status of the Windhoek conference people? I
                            thought we had understood each other on that. They are a group of people
                            called together by South Africa, under South African auspices, in a
                            territory under de facto South African control. Even if you do not
                            say—as we do—that they are merely the puppets of South Africa, surely
                            those other points are incontrovertible. I had told you that they could
                            go to Geneva as part of the South African delegation. I thought that is
                            what you meant in your letter of 4th October.</p>
                        <p>For as I said on 21st September, it is not for <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> to select the South African delegation, any more than
                            it is acceptable for South Africa to select <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss>’s delegation—which is why the question of <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> people in prison is also relevant.
                            What is necessary is that the discussion should be between fully
                            authorised delegations from (A) <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                            >SWAPO</gloss>, and (B) South Africa, under U.N. auspices. The persons
                            in each delegation are a matter for the respective authorities to
                            decide. I am sorry if I seem dense, but I cannot see what is so
                            difficult about this, and why you do not now feel able to ask the U.N.
                            Secretary-General to convene a constitutional conference.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our letters
                            inevitably concentrate on difficulties and disagreements because it is
                            they which require our thought, and perhaps action. But I do want to
                            emphasize my very great appreciation of the efforts you have made this
                            year to get a settlement on the basis of majority rule in Zimbabwe and
                            Namibia. That there has been movement on the non-military front in
                            southern Africa during 1976 is due in very large part to the initiatives
                            you have taken, and these have demanded a great amount of time and
                            travelling and negotiation (perhaps not always easy or pleasant) on your
                            part. We do not yet know whether, when this vortex of negotiation has
                            settled, we shall have reached the objective; we are dealing with
                            questions of long-standing which have become even more difficult as time
                            has passed. But whatever happens I want to stress that I do appreciate
                            your efforts, and I do hope that you will not allow any disappointments
                            (temporary or otherwise) to lead to doubt either about the validity of
                                <pb n="650" facs="0689" xml:id="pg_650"/>this attempt, or about the
                            cause of majority rule in southern Africa for which we have been
                            working.</p>
                        <p>This letter therefore comes to you with my very warm personal good wishes
                            once again. I am sure we shall have further contact in the future—after
                            January as well as possibly again before the change in the American
                            government.</p>

                                sacred trust not to influence things in another country by trying to
                                choose its leaders.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                        <p>Dear Mr Secretary,</p>
                        <p>I have received your letter of 7th December, 1976. I must say that this
                            was a most surprising letter to say the least. I was greatly disturbed
                            by the inference and insinuations that appeared to cast doubt on our
                            good faith relative to the Anglo-American proposals on the resolution of
                            the conflict in Zimbabwe. Your message was couched in terminology which
                            is manifestly unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>I want to make it quite clear, Mr. Secretary, that threats from whatever
                            quarter make no impression on us. In a way it was good that this <pb
                                n="651" facs="0690" xml:id="pg_651"/>letter came through to us at
                            this time because it has revealed that we have, after all, been working
                            at cross purposes in this exercise.<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">In

                        <p>You mention that the concept of sharing power on the basis of a two-tier
                            system was never challenged. I wish to state with equal frankness and
                            unequivocally that neither the words two-tier system nor power sharing
                            on this basis were ever mentioned at any one time during our
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p>Further, your emissaries had assured me and you, yourself, said later
                            that the 5 points which you now refer to were merely talking points.
                            They could never be considered on a take-it or leave it basis; this is
                            the impression we gained. Frankly, this was not our understanding and
                            this could not have been the spirit of your message of 31st August and
                            26th September, 1976.<note n="5" xml:id="d231fn5">For the September 26
                                letter, see <ref target="#d211">Document 211</ref>.</note> However,
                            I consider that the matters at hand are so grave and the stakes so high
                            that I should set out the basis upon which Zambia got involved in the
                            present exercise.</p>
                        <p>First, I want to say that we have always acted in good faith. We agreed
                            to co-operate in the finding of a peaceful solution even though we were
                            already on the road to armed struggle. I informed you about this during
                            your African tour.<note n="6" xml:id="d231fn6">See <ref target="#d195"
                                    >Document 195</ref>.</note> Indeed, on the 27th of April in
                            Lusaka during a luncheon which I gave in your honour, I embraced you at
                            the end of your speech out of respect for what you had said. My embrace
                            was not a matter of ceremony but a demonstration of the depth of my
                            feelings which grew with every conversation and communication we had on
                            the matters at hand.</p>
                        <p>Second, the conversations which we had with your officials, Under
                            Secretary Rogers and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName> on the various occasions left us with the
                            clear impression that the Smith government would withdraw in favour of a
                            caretaker government which would in turn announce its acceptance of
                            majority rule and call for discussions on how to implement majority rule
                            with the nationalists. Prior to your departure for Pretoria we warned
                            you that Smith was a very slippery character who had defeated every
                            major effort by successive British governments to find a solution to the
                            problem of Zimbabwe. We cautioned about any meeting that would give
                            respectability to Smith. You assured us that you did not come to fail
                            and that if we heard that you had <pb n="652" facs="0691"
                                xml:id="pg_652"/>met Smith it should be considered good news.<note
                                n="7" xml:id="d231fn7">See <ref target="#d205">Document
                                205</ref>.</note> On your return, however, we noticed that you
                            appeared to have given to Smith certain undertakings which it is clear
                            from your letter prompted Smith to accept the Anglo-American
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>The third point is that the conversations which we had with your
                            emissaries and the clearly encouraging picture which emerged was further
                            buttressed by your letter of 31st August, 1976,<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d231fn8">The letter was transmitted to Lusaka in telegram

                        <p>(A) There would be withdrawal of the present government in favour of a

                        <p>(B) The drafting of a constitution which includes a basic protection for

                            earlier.</p>
                        <p>This set against the background of the clear picture we had gained with
                            your emissaries earlier about the seriousness of your proposals clearly
                            increased credibility that you had chosen a path that was worth our
                            support.</p>
                        <p>It was sincerely on this basis and out of faith in your ability to honour
                            your word once you gave it that we agreed to give our co-operation to
                            the Anglo-American proposals.</p>
                        <p>Our confidence was further increased by the reassuring message which you
                            sent on the 26th of September, 1976, following Smith’s broadcast two
                            days earlier. At this time the presidents of the frontline countries
                            were meeting in Lusaka. Again when we combined your reassuring statement
                            of 26th September<note n="9" xml:id="d231fn9"><ref target="#d211"
                                    >Document 211</ref>.</note> with the scenerio that had emerged
                            with your emissaries, we were satisfied that there was a clear and
                            irrevocable commitment to the road which we believed we were traversing
                            together. This gave us faith and provided further ground for our maximum
                            co-operation. Indeed, only recently at the opening of the Geneva
                            conference the British Chairman <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor
                                Richard</persName> in his opening remarks said among other
                            things—“we are not concerned with whether there will be majority rule in
                            Rhodesia, we are concerned with when and how. We are not discussing
                            whether power will be transferred to the majority, we are discussing the
                            modality of that transfer.”</p>
                        <p>Very little have we known that there has been a grave misunderstanding
                            about the interpretation of the cooperation which we have given all
                            along in this exercise until my conversation with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName> and now your letter of
                            December 7. I must now and equally <pb n="653" facs="0692"
                                xml:id="pg_653"/>frankly say that we have ground to believe that we
                            were misled. We were convinced that we were talking the same language
                            when in fact this was not so. We have been talking on two different
                            wavelengths.</p>
                        <p>It is not my impression that the nationalists in Geneva are being
                            unrealistic. In fact their proposals are very reasonable. They have
                            asked for a unicameral arrangement supported by a British presence which
                            together would give confidence to all the races and build a foundation
                            in the transitional government upon which people of all races in
                            Rhodesia would work together to build peace on the basis of equality. We
                            are now being told that the nationalists’ attitude does not provide
                            guarantees. But there are guaranteed seats for whites in the
                            transitional government. The reality of the Rhodesian situation itself
                            including the judiciary, civil service, economy and other strategic
                            areas in the Zimbabwe society will ensure that the white community will
                            continue to have a meaningful voice and protection not only in the
                            transitional period but in the period afterwards.</p>
                        <p>We are being told that <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss> should
                            reconsider its position. Frankly we believe that the proposals being put
                            forward by the nationalists are realistic. What surprises me is that
                            when you do not like anything it is being labelled unrealistic. Anything
                            else that the nationalists offer is unrealistic and ambiguous. When you
                            assert that you want a moderate and responsible government in Zimbabwe
                            and one which would not pose a threat to Zambia, I must say that we do
                            not need any guidance about what our interests are or what is best for
                            us. Who are we to choose a government that will govern Zimbabwe? This is
                            the sacred right of the six million people of that country.</p>
                        <p>In all frankness, I am not yet convinced that we are now being led to
                            believe that your present attitude is reminiscent of the past posture of
                            successive American administrations on the problems of this area. We had
                            warned about this, a warning which you, yourself acknowledged. But we
                            are now definitely worried that again and in spite of all that has been
                            done already the United States may end up backing the wrong horse.</p>
                        <p>If the programme that we believe would guarantee peace and security for
                            all is now being labelled unrealistic then we are quite happy to go
                            along the path which we had chosen before and that is the path of armed
                            struggle. We are not unaware of the risks that are involved in the
                            struggle. But we in Zambia have known no peace and our life has been
                            dedicated to serving that which we consider to be right and just.</p>
                        <p>We operate on principles as you know, Mr. Secretary, but I must tell you
                            that Zambia will go down fighting on the side of right. We would like to
                            die as noble men and women. This is why I said earlier that threats do
                            not impress us. We seek a solution that ends the war not half-measures.
                            The global problems in the context of southern Africa <pb n="654"
                                facs="0693" xml:id="pg_654"/>demand that a solution that meets the
                            legitimate interests of the oppressed people be found and found quickly.
                            That is the solution that would end the present conflict. If now the
                            United States Government do not appear to share our conviction in this
                            problem they will end by fighting on the wrong side. This will not be in
                            the interests of the United States and of world peace.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore not deal with the past, there is a problem to be
                            resolved at the moment. We need a formula that does not insure the place
                            of the white community in the transitional government but that which
                            provides protection and safety for them for all time in an independent
                            Zimbabwe. The British Government has now indicated their preparedness to
                            establish a presence in the interim government. They will need all the
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Warm regards,</p>

                        <p>A. Smith’s attitude has improved somewhat since his arrival yesterday and
                            it now looks as if he will not pull out of the conference before the
                            Secretary’s meetings in London this weekend. The Secretary’s

                            effect, and for the moment, no further action is necessary.</p>
                        <p>B. Smith’s sense of having been betrayed both by us and especially the
                            British is real. He is convinced that the bargain has not been adhered
                            to. He claims he expected the nationalists would be held to a discussion
                            of the five points, and he is not prepared at present to see the
                            negotiations continue on any other basis. Given his perception of the
                            British performance to date, he will not be easily moved toward
                            acceptance of an expanded British role in the interim government as a
                            substitute for power being retained in white Rhodesian hands.</p>
                        <p>C. Nevertheless, he has at least indicated a willingness to consider
                            alternative proposals and has signalled that he will not for the time
                            being strike out on his own or seek a settlement outside the Geneva
                            framework. He is probing for African support of a non-Geneva settlement
                            but cannot realistically hold out real hope in this respect. He will be
                            looking to the results of the Secretary’s meetings in London and,
                            following this, a clear signal from us on what the next steps should
                            be.</p>
                        <p>II. Reactions to Letters to the Front Line Presidents.</p>
                        <p>A. The word is now out in Geneva about the Secretary’s letters to the
                            front line presidents.<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note> Their effect, as
                            communicated by the observers here, has been both shocking and sobering.
                            The British here share our view that such an approach was needed to halt
                            the slide into unreality, which had been reflected here in growing
                            insistence on the part of both the nationalists and the observers on
                            instant majority rule. As a result, both the nationalists and the
                            observers are more aware that we cannot, and will not, attempt to press
                            their extreme demands upon Smith or the South Africans, and there may be
                            better recognition that a settlement must be based on compromise.</p>

                        <p>—Discuss with <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> how the

                            required to get the front line presidents to agree to support this
                            concept.</p>
                        <p>C. While we do not know all that <persName corresp="#p_RSS_1"
                                >Ramphal</persName> intends to discuss on behalf of <persName
                                corresp="#p_OO_1">Obasanjo</persName>, we know from Nigerian
                            observer Anyaoku that he will be outlining a proposal (which we assume
                            was authored by Anyaoku himself) for a repackaging of Geneva based on
                            expanded <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> involvement. If this is the
                            case, we believe that the Nigerians should also be reminded of realities
                            and encouraged to put their weight behind compromise.</p>
                        <p>III. The British Role.</p>
                        <p>A. All of the Geneva observers are now convinced that active British
                            participation in the interim government is an essential element to any
                            successful negotiated outcome. While none of them has yet been able to
                            specify what that role should be, all believe that new settlement
                            package based on an expanded British role can be sold to the front line
                            presidents, who can in turn gain nationalist acceptance. The British
                            delegation here indicated that their government is now prepared to
                            consider responsibilities far greater than any it was prepared to assume
                            at the outset. The Geneva delegation, including Richard, indicates it
                            expects decisions to be made this weekend in London for consultations
                            with the front line presidents and Rhodesians and the South
                            Africans.</p>
                        <p>B. As previously noted, however, Smith remains deeply distrustful of the
                            British, whom he regards as being both weak and indecisive and in league
                            with the Africans, and is therefore extremely skeptical about British
                            involvement in the interim government. Therefore, we will have to give
                            careful thought to how and how much British involvement we might be
                            prepared to press upon Smith in order to achieve a settlement in the
                            coming days.</p>
                        <p>IV. The Recess Issue.</p>
                        <p>A. A conference recess is inevitable since there is no way that a
                            settlement can be achieved by December 20. The Rhodesians would like to
                            see an adjournment as soon as possible. Richard’s preference is that the
                            conference adjourn as early as December 14, following your meetings <pb
                                n="657" facs="0696" xml:id="pg_657"/>in London. All, including the
                            observers and the nationalists, agree that the way in which the
                            conference adjourns is more important than when. It will be essential to
                            end the conference on the most positive note possible if there is to be
                            any chance of getting the parties back together after the holidays. This
                            may prove to be the only way out of the current impasse. The British in
                            particular must be ready to make a major effort in this regard. The
                            Secretary may wish to press them to develop their ideas on how the
                            recess should be engineered.</p>
                        <p>B. The Secretary might also press the British to fix a date for
                            reconvening the conference. The shorter the recess the better, otherwise
                            energies will dissipate and momentum will be lost. We believe that the
                            recess should not exceed three to four weeks. We will also need to plan
                            carefully how the interim is to be used. The British have proposed a
                            shuttle of their own to consult in various African capitals. We should
                            hold them to this while giving consideration to how we can complement
                            their efforts.</p>
                        <p>C. Both the nationalists and the observers have raised objections to
                            reconvening in Geneva. While their objections have not been specific, we
                            imagine that cost is at least one factor. While we suspect that some—not
                            all, including <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName>—would prefer to meet
                            in an African capital, they can probably be brought to recognize that no
                            African site would be acceptable. Smith also objects to Geneva because
                            he believes it encourages the nationalists temptation to grandstand and
                            escalate their demands. In the final analysis, we believe these
                            objections are of little importance if an acceptable basis for
                            continuing the negotiations can be found, particularly one to which the
                            nationalists and the front line states are to some degree committed.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I thank you very much
                            for coming, and if you agree, the first thing is to ask Ivor to explain
                            what has changed at Geneva in the last three weeks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Good.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: The main thing since the
                            argument on the date, which was a marathon confrontation, is that since
                            then the Africans have conducted themselves in a rational way.</p>
                        <p>Two things are very clear. One is that Annex C<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d233fn2">See <ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>.</note>
                            as such is not a starter. It is very hard to see how if it was tabled as
                            a conference document, or if Smith tabled it, it could bridge the gap.
                            Basically the nationalists all say there can be no Council of State or
                            anything that smacks of it.</p>
                        <pb n="659" facs="0698" xml:id="pg_659"/>
                        <p>There have been a number of hints out of Salisbury which seem to indicate
                            that Smith’s objective in this exercise is to buy time for himself and
                            that he’s not serious about the transfer of power.</p>
                        <p>We have to bridge that gap. One way is if we can get Smith himself to
                            agree to a date for independence and to produce a definition of majority
                            rule. I raised this with him and he agreed to do this, but his proposals
                            were ludicrous. His position now is he’s not prepared to discuss the
                            composition of the Council of State or the definition of it. Before he
                            sits again, he wants me and the African delegates to agree the purpose
                            of the conference is to appoint the Council of State. Second, Smith
                            believes it’s all the Chairman’s fault. He feels I should have made all
                            the delegations start with five points.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d217">Document 217</ref>.</note> He’s in an angry
                            mood.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there was something very hopeful. He said if the
                            British Government were to call an adjournment and come up with some new
                            proposal, he would consider it and consider it very seriously.</p>
                        <p>The Africans want an adjournment too. <persName corresp="#p_SN_1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We frankly thought of
                            January 20.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The only trouble is
                            all the world press on that date would be filled with a picture of me
                            being carried out in my chair. I think you should choose a date either
                            before or after, not January 20.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: But it is clear that
                            Annex C is not a starter. We will need a new package.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Ted, give them our ideas

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: First, when we announce
                            the adjournment, it should be on a positive note.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Seeing it as a hopeful
                            moment in the conference. Ivor and Dennis would put together a new
                            shuttle to work out a new package which would have a broad measure of
                            agreement. We want the agreement of the four Presidents to the
                            definition of the British role. <pb n="660" facs="0699" xml:id="pg_660"
                            />We would hope to get at least the acquiescence of Smith that Annex C
                            isn’t going to work.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My understanding is
                            that Smith was going to put forward Annex C but we urged him not to do
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: His staff proposed it to
                            him but he didn’t want to do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: He should because it
                            would be embarrassing if the conference broke up without anyone putting
                            forward Annex C.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: He is convinced that in
                            the present mood it would be shot down. He was very categorical.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I wonder if Smith
                            should do it and if we should pay the price for it. If he were eager to
                            do it, I’d let him do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: It’s water under the
                            bridge now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: (Reads from own notes)
                            “He felt in his view it would only create an explosion.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then we’d better leave
                            it as it is, because if we urged it we would be committed to back
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: He’ll blame me for not
                            putting it forward and would have blamed me for not having the
                            opportunity. He can’t say he had no opportunity, but he will say we
                            didn’t try to sell it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We now seem to have a
                            very detailed Cabinet agreement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The question is
                            whether it is really Cabinet agreement. (Laughter)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Although there is a gap,
                            it seems the gap is no longer unbridgeable between what we can do and

                            Council of Ministers chaired by the Resident Commissioner. Each of the
                            five delegations will choose five members and the Resident Commissioner
                            will choose five. So there will be 30 ministers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Ten will be white?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Ten will be white. The
                            Rhodesians’ five and the five chosen by the Resident Commissioner. The
                            advantage is to avoid having to choose a Prime Minister, because that
                            could be one of the biggest bustups ever. The Council would have
                            legislative and executive authority. The Heads of the delegations would
                            be a Privy Council.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You replace the
                            Council of State with a British Resident Commissioner. The heads of

                        <p>Rowland: The Resident Commissioner is white. There are four blacks in the
                            Privy Council and one white. One non-white minister that he has
                            appointed would be on the National Security Commission. And three chiefs

                        <p>Rowland: We see them chosen from outside Rhodesia. They could be
                            Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: For presentational

                            and Order black from the Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: I think the notion of

                            we’ll sell it. We hope the United States will be for it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you want to sell it

                            it to the whites? Or should it be something that has been explored with
                            the whites so it’s not a new idea?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: We wouldn’t object to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Wait a minute. They’re
                            all suspicious of the United States and Great Britain. They think we’re
                            doing this to avoid majority rule.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But if we explore it
                            first with not the Rhodesians but the South Africans . . . It would be
                            helpful if at the time you try to sell it to the black Africans we know
                            the South Africans will be helpful.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We can’t do a lot of
                            bargaining with the South Africans on what we will try to sell.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You have to have

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: (Pauses) Let’s pursue
                            this. As Ivor tells it, we want to get into a take-it-or-leave-it
                            situation. Suppose we get something that safeguards white interests?
                            We’ll have to put it on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then you don’t need

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We won’t oppose it.
                            Frank had an idea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: Which is pretty close. It
                            had a second tier but I admit it will be hard. Perhaps there is some
                            hope in running a two-tier system—the top tier you would chair and be
                            the tie-breaker. And a Council of Ministers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: What powers would it
                            have?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: The original legislative
                            powers in Annex C. There are a lot of presentational advantages in this
                            structure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Parity can’t be sold

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: That’s dead. But I think
                            we could sell a kind of blocking mechanism.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But that’s a veto.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: It depends on whether
                            it’s British or Rhodesian.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: How do you see this Privy

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: A two-thirds majority
                            wouldn’t work. A balance of the Council of Ministers would mean the

                        <p>We’re substituting for parity a Resident Commissioner. He would have
                            authority for defense and law and order. Power may be vested in him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My fear that you may

                        <p>I wrote to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> to make clear
                            there was a possibility of a breakup, that there was a limit beyond

                            is to keep the limits clear.</p>
                        <p>Second, we got it to this point by combining our power with South African
                            power. If we don’t bring the South Africans into it, what you work out
                            with the blacks won’t mean anything. I’d hate to see you and blacks
                            agree on something we couldn’t deliver.</p>
                        <p>This is the first hearing. I’d have to see it on paper. But this is a
                            drastic change and the Rhodesians will possibly see it as total
                            surrender to the blacks. I’m not saying it is.</p>
                        <p>My instructions to my people were to talk about Annex C, not about
                            getting rid of Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We spent a lot of talk
                            about this, Henry. We talked about a transitional government without
                            Smith. After your talks with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>, we switched to the idea that Smith would sell
                            it but then disappear. But this hasn’t happened. The five points would
                            have to be modified. It’s been changed because Smith is still there;
                            there will have to be a change on the other side.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The easiest way to get
                            rid of Smith is to set up a transitional government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: But the Rhodesian
                            delegation at Geneva assumes Smith will still be there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I would separate the
                            setting up of a transitional government from the membership of Smith. I
                            was afraid the immediate elimination of Smith would create a collapse of
                            the whole structure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: The question now is what

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Your proposal can have
                            two purposes. One is to put something forward that you know will be
                            rejected. We’re not there yet. If it isn’t that, then we have to see
                            what the South Africans can go along with. We don’t have to let it be
                            known it’s been discussed with the South Africans. They’ve kept
                            secrets.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We don’t have to
                            settle it now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We’ll refine these ideas
                            further and then put it to you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I know what you’ll do.
                            If you don’t put it to the Cabinet, it has no standing; if you do put it
                            to the Cabinet, it can’t be changed!</p>
                        <p>If we do come to agreement on what may be saleable to both sides, then
                            we—you or we, probably we—should go to the South Africans to see what
                            you’re up against when you do sell it to the blacks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: The nationalists now at
                            Geneva are a lot less likely to take the fire from the front-line
                            Presidents. A lot has changed in the balance of power since
                            September.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: This was clear in my

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But if the conference

                            and also <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName> and the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PM_1">Palliser</persName>: They might not share

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: One thing that has
                            impressed us is their highly developed instinct for their survival.
                            There is no chance they’d survive a guerrilla war.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: What is the timing of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: We would start out on the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: For ten days or

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: No, two weeks. They would
                            have time to form a view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The best way to find
                            out their view is to ask them.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that <persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Frank

                            happened at Geneva than any two people we have, meet with any people you
                            designate once you have a paper.</p>
                        <p>It’s an ingenious scheme. The trick is to convince the South Africans
                            it’s not a total sell-out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: It has to be saleable to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: It’s really going back to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My first idea was a
                            British presence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: That’s right. I’m just
                            saying . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Smith once proposed
                            going back to the Constitution of 1961. Would you, under that
                            Constitution, have authority to implement all of this?</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: No, we wouldn’t.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: Parity is dead, so the
                            question is how to give assurances and balances by other means than
                            simply looking at the color of the faces around the table.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What the whites fear
                            most is—they’re not determined to prevent any action—but that the system
                            after it’s set up, will be overthrown, as all other systems in
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: This is what the blacks
                            fear, too.</p>
                        <p>One idea is Commonwealth presence. The Chairman of the Commonwealth is
                            keen on this; he’s talked to the Canadians. We are afraid of getting
                            into an Ulster situation when in effect we have only one chap out there.
                            This would be much harder for either side to bust up.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’d like to see it on
                            paper, with all the suitable disclaimers. (Laughter) Can we see it, with
                            full understanding that it’s a think piece?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When do you think
                            it’ll be ready?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: Wednesday.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then Frank and Jack
                            will come back Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: The objective is to have
                            something that can win the acceptance of the South African Government
                            but will be acceptable to the blacks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The whole point is to
                            liquidate the Rhodesian problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: The blacks are getting
                            stronger and stronger every day. All intelligence reports indicate
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. The South
                            Africans are looking for an honorable way to get out. Their definition
                            of honorable is something that appears as a logical evolution from the
                            earlier discussions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Richard</persName>: Smith wouldn’t see this
                            as a logical evolution from the previous.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the South Africans
                            kept their secrecy scrupulously before.</p>
                        <p>By the end of next week, we will have some kind of agreement. Then we’ll
                            discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName>. You’ll
                            have their reaction before you go. I wouldn’t say they have a veto over
                            your trip.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: There is a great and
                            growing consensus in favor of a British presence.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s a very important
                            step, your willingness to undertake this.</p>
                        <p>Your statement Tuesday will give some hope?</p>

                                in southern Africa. He also mentioned a direct British role during

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is interesting that

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: Ten bottles!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Ten bottles, of which
                            four could go to the whites. He didn’t say which four.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: We would make clear our
                            commitment to the British presence is conditional on a cessation of
                            guerrilla war when the internal government is formed, and the lifting of
                            sanctions. And making it clear we won’t stand for being stuck there in a
                            civil war. There will be the strictest conditions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You judge what the
                            Nigerian statement is worth. (Reads:) “We shouldn’t take too seriously
                            the rejection of a two-tier structure. We should get away from the term
                            though not the concept of power sharing. The term suggests to them
                            Smith’s idea of parity. Picking up on a metaphor earlier, Anyuoko said
                            if there were ten bottles, four could go to the whites.”</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’re not proposing
                            any delay. You’re proposing to leave on the 28th. Our suggestion is that
                            Jack and Frank talk with you next week. Our capacity to develop British

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RE_1">Rowlands</persName>: We tell the blacks: What

                            State’s (<persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>’s) constituency
                            (in April). The blacks will win. The only question is whether they win
                            soon, by a moderate solution, or slowly by violence. It’s still in our
                            interest to bring it about in the best possible circumstances.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Our predisposition is
                            to support it. This reasoning got us into it in the first place. Our
                            predisposition is to come up with a proposal that you believe is
                            saleable and that we can support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>: It was just your use of
                            the phrase “blocking mechanism.”</p>
                        <p>One other point. How do we stand on the fund?</p>
                        <p>Duff: The proposal is that you and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> should approach potential donors. That should
                            be as soon as possible because it may be useful to Ivor to throw this
                            card in once in a while, with both sides.</p>

                            nature of the scheme it is. There is an annex—which I am glad to say is
                            Annex 2, not Annex B or C—which gives more information about the <pb

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Begin text of joint letter:</hi> Dear (use
                            appropriate title):</p>
                        <p>—Recent events lead us to believe that a peaceful settlement of the
                            Rhodesian problem is now possible. The acceptance of majority rule by
                            the Smith regime and the convening of the Geneva conference were major
                            steps forward. While there are still major problems to overcome, we are
                            hopeful that agreement on an acceptable settlement can be reached.</p>
                        <p>—There can be no doubt that the alternative to a negotiated settlement is
                            increased racial tension leading to further bloodshed. A civil war in
                            Rhodesia is unlikely to be confined to that country. A Rhodesian
                            conflict would be a threat to peace and stability in the whole of
                            southern Africa.</p>
                        <p>—A successful negotiation would open up many opportunities to improve the
                            general welfare and economic security of the people of Rhodesia. We
                            believe that an international economic effort supported by the world’s
                            major powers, can make a vital contribution to the programs of the
                            interim and independent governments of Rhodesia, enabling them to
                            realize development opportunities and conduct an orderly restructuring
                            of the economy. Such an effort would be designed to impress both
                            Africans and Europeans that they have much to gain in cooperating in the
                            future development of Zimbabwe.</p>
                        <p>—The United States and the United Kingdom have been engaged in
                            discussions to elaborate this proposal for an international fund. It
                            would seek to draw together international financial support to assist a
                            future Zimbabwe government to promote economic and social development,
                            expansion of training and employment opportunities for Africans, and
                            economic security for all sectors of the Rhodesian population. We
                            enclose a description of the proposed fund with an account of the areas
                            in which it would function. You will see that paragraph 9 deals with the
                            contributions to the fund which will be made by our two governments. We
                            envisage that any contributions by participating governments would be
                            dependent on both the interim and the independent governments of
                            Rhodesia accepting responsibility for honoring their international
                            financial obligations.</p>
                        <p>—We are approaching a limited number of governments to contribute to the
                            important political and economic purposes in mind, on a basis taking
                            account of historical connections with Africa, relative gross national
                            product, ability to find the necessary resources, and readiness to
                            contribute to the solution of the economic problems of the developing
                            world. We therefore very much hope that your government will seriously
                            consider participating in this fund. We are sure that this will greatly
                            increase its effectiveness and enhance its appeal to a future government
                            of Zimbabwe. (Note to typists: the sentence that follows “Zim<pb n="672"
                                facs="0711" xml:id="pg_672"/>babwe” is deleted as it changes in each
                            letter. See instructions below.) Approaches are being made in parallel
                            to the following governments: the member states of the European
                            Community, Australia, Canada, Iran, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Norway,
                            Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
                        <p>—We should like, if this is acceptable to you, to follow this letter as
                            soon as possible with more detailed discussions with your government,
                            through the diplomatic channel or by means of a special mission to your
                            country.</p>

                            Economic Support for a Rhodesian Settlement: A Proposal.”</p>
                        <p>—A political settlement in Rhodesia, involving first an interim
                            government and later an independent government of Zimbabwe, would remove
                            a source of acute conflict and help establish a climate conducive to
                            economic development in central and southern Africa. A political
                            settlement, however, will set in motion an economic transition which
                            will be most effective if accompanied by measures designed to realize
                            the growth potential of the economy and rapidly improve opportunities
                            for all the population of Zimbabwe. The responsibility for the necessary
                            economic measures after independence will rest primarily with the new
                            government, but it is already evident, in spite of the sparse detail at
                            present available about the present state and future prospects of the
                            economy, that substantial international economic assistance and external
                            private investment will be needed. (A brief assessment of the state of
                            the Rhodesian economy is at Annex 1.)</p>
                        <p>—When a political settlement is achieved, the lifting of sanctions,
                            combined with aid, will provide both Zimbabwe and its neighbors with new
                            development prospects. Different trade and transport patterns will be
                            established. African Zimbabweans should have expanded access to better
                            jobs in mining, industry, commerce and the public service. More balanced
                            patterns of ownership for farms, houses and businesses will emerge.
                            External assistance can help the people of Zimbabwe effect the social
                            and economic changes required to take advantage of these new
                            opportunities for a more prosperous and balanced economy.</p>
                        <p>—The ability of an independent government of Zimbabwe to raise the living
                            standards of the poor majority depends not only on the development of
                            the traditional sector but also on effective administration and a high
                            level of output in the modern sector, which accounts for the greater
                            part of Rhodesia’s export earnings, internal revenues, domestic
                            production of consumer goods, and wage employment of African
                            Zimbabweans. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance to find ways
                            to facilitate the economic transition while minimizing its disruptive
                            effect on the potential for economic growth. It is crucial that skilled
                            workers and managerial personnel are encouraged to continue to
                            contribute to the welfare and prosperity of the economy.</p>
                        <p>—The United States and Great Britain have, therefore, agreed to cooperate
                            in helping to organize an international economic effort in support of a
                            Rhodesian settlement. They propose the establishment of a <pb n="675"
                                facs="0714" xml:id="pg_675"/>Zimbabwe Development Fund. The purpose
                            of this fund would be to assist the new government to promote:</p>
                        <p>(I) balanced economic and social development in Zimbabwe;</p>
                        <p>(II) rapid expansion of economic opportunities for and skills of the
                            African majority;</p>
                        <p>(III) basic economic security for all sections of the population so that
                            they might continue to contribute their skills and enthusiasm to the
                            development of the country.</p>
                        <p>—The different ways in which the fund could assist in these objectives
                            are described in more detail in Annex 2. In brief, however, the fund
                            would respond to requests from the Zimbabwe government to support
                            specific proposals for development projects and programs, for example,
                            in agricultural and land reform, education and training, and social and
                            economic infrastructure. Its efforts should encourage commercial capital
                            flows, especially in extractive, processing, and manufacturing
                            industries, supported as appropriate by national export credit and
                            investment insurance agencies. The fund should be prepared to provide
                            balance of payments support during a period of economic transition,
                            especially to enable the gradual return to normal external relations
                            after the lifting of sanctions. The fund could also provide support for,
                            and take into account the balance of payments implications of, programs
                            designed to encourage skilled labor and managerial personnel to
                            contribute to Zimbabwe development and to effect a smooth transition to
                            a more balanced pattern of access to ownership of farms, houses, and
                            businesses.</p>
                        <p>—The fund should be established as soon as possible after the
                            establishment of an interim government in Rhodesia. Even before it began
                            to be funded to any considerable extent, the fund could begin working
                            with developmental institutions, either already existing or to be
                            established by the Zimbabwe government. The fund could assist both the
                            interim government and the independent government of Zimbabwe to plan
                            development projects and programs consistent with the political changes
                            which will have taken place without disruption of the economy. The fund
                            could, in the initial period, also coordinate bilateral development
                            assistance, especially in the training of Africans in technical and
                            administrative skills.</p>
                        <p>—Since specific development projects and programs for an independent
                            Zimbabwe are not yet available, a precise quantification of the
                            resources needed by the fund is not possible. A preliminary assessment,
                            however, suggests that contributions, on concessionary terms, from those
                            governments willing to participate in the fund should be at a minimum
                            approaching one billion dollars and at a maximum rather less than one
                            and a half billion dollars. The fund’s objectives, and the fact that
                            experience shows that economic development projects take a <pb n="676"
                                facs="0715" xml:id="pg_676"/>long time to mature, will make it
                            necessary to envisage a fairly long period of disbursement of the fund’s
                            resources. It is suggested, however, in order that the management of the
                            fund can plan its operations in the knowledge of the total amount of its
                            resources and so that it can meet extraordinary balance of payments
                            demands on its resources during an economic transition, contributions by
                            participating governments should be made over a five-year period with
                            the likelihood of a longer period of actual disbursement in mind.</p>
                        <p>—Flows of bilateral concessional aid could, it is suggested, be counted
                            as part of their contribution to the fund, but the greater part of each
                            country’s contribution, at least during the first five years of its
                            operation, should be direct to the fund. On this basis, initial finance
                            envisaged for the fund might be say two-thirds over a five-year period
                            in cash or in promissory notes, and say one-third on call if the
                            management of the fund should require it for the fulfillment of its
                            longer-term objectives. The method by which the contributions were made
                            can be discussed between governments and need not necessarily be
                            uniform: for example, some governments might prefer to contribute cash
                            at regular intervals in equal installments. Others might prefer to make
                            available promissory notes for encashment as disbursements by the fund
                            require, a method permitted in replenishment of the resources of the
                            International Development Association. The questions of the currencies
                            in which the contributions should be made, and the degree and structure
                            of any arrangement for tying of procurement in the participating
                            countries and provision for the local costs of development projects can
                            be the subject of intergovernmental consultation. The nature of the
                            economic assistance extended by the fund should be such that the
                            contributions of participating governments would be expected to qualify
                            as official development assistance in accordance with the criteria of
                            the Development Assistance Committee.</p>
                        <p>—On this basis, the Government of the United States would, subject to the
                            authorization and appropriation of funds by the U.S. Congress, be
                            prepared to contribute 40 percent to the total resources of the fund up
                            to a maximum of $520 million, the major part a direct contribution to
                            the fund and the rest in the form of bilateral assistance; and the
                            Government of the United Kingdom would be prepared, subject to
                            Parliamentary approval, to contribute 15 percent of the resources
                            provided directly to the fund, up to a maximum of 75 million pounds, and
                            in addition to provide 41 million pounds of bilateral aid, over a
                            five-year period. The U.S. and British contributions would be
                            conditional on each other and on contributions being forthcoming from
                            other countries on an equitable basis.</p>
                        <p>—The fund will also facilitate action by agencies of donor countries to
                            make appropriate non-concessional loans and guarantees to en<pb n="677"
                                facs="0716" xml:id="pg_677"/>courage commercial trade and private
                            investment flows to Zimbabwe. These would be additional to the
                            concessionary contributions discussed above.</p>
                        <p>—Voting arrangements for policy decisions should be related to financial
                            contributions but would not necessarily be directly proportional to
                            them. It is not envisaged that the fund would need a managerial staff of
                            its own; it would draw on the capabilities of existing multilateral
                            institutions such as the World Bank and other United Nations agencies.
                            The fund could also provide support for regional development projects
                            and take part in any consortium or consultative group established to
                            coordinate development assistance to Zimbabwe and relate it to
                            development aid to the southern Africa region as a whole.</p>

                            Economy.”</p>
                        <p>—Zimbabwe is well-endowed with natural resources and despite the dual
                            nature of the economy the long-run prospects, based upon more balanced
                            development and opportunities for all sections of the population, are
                            good. The present state of the Rhodesian economy, however, is critical
                            and the sustaining of the economy in the immediate future, together with
                            the realization of its potential, will require careful economic
                            management, the formulation of an appropriate national development
                            strategy, and substantial international development aid to assist in its
                            implementation.</p>
                        <p>—The population of Rhodesia consists of 6 million Africans and 275,000 of
                            other racial origin, including about 10,000 Asians, 30,000 of Portuguese
                            extraction who fled from Mozambique, and a significant Greek population.
                            The separate education system for Africans has effectively limited their
                            opportunities at all levels. Access to technical education and training
                            is particularly limited and the practice of job reservation means a
                            marked absence of Africans in skilled and managerial positions in both
                            the public and private sectors. Many African graduates remain abroad.
                            The bulk of the African population resides within the tribal trust areas
                            although, since about 1 million Africans have wage employment in the
                            modern sector, there is considerable separation of families and a lack
                            of adult males in these areas.</p>
                        <p>—The Rhodesian economy consists of a large modern sector (including
                            public administration, commercial agriculture, basic services, mining
                            and manufacturing) which generates over 80 percent of recorded <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, and provides substantial wage
                            employment, domestic consumption goods, and the principal sources of
                            foreign exchange earnings, and a traditional, largely subsistence,
                            agricultural sector suffering from considerable land pressure and
                            inadequate services.</p>
                        <pb n="678" facs="0717" xml:id="pg_678"/>
                        <p>—Associated with the imposition of sanctions the modern sector has
                            undergone some restructuring, with greater emphasis on import
                            substitution and diversification. The share of the manufacturing sector
                            in the economy has risen since 1965 and commercial agricultural
                            production has been broadened from its previous concentration on tobacco
                            to include cattle, maize and wheat. The volume of mineral production has
                            almost doubled.</p>
                        <p>—Despite the resilience and growth which the Rhodesian economy showed
                            until 1974, it has since been seriously affected by sanctions (including
                            the closure of the Mozambique border in 1976), the world recession
                            (particularly as it affects South Africa), and the escalation of
                            violence. Detailed data are not available, but the proportion of public
                            expenditure diverted for defense purposes has increased considerably and
                            taking account of loans to the para-statal sector the government has
                            sustained an overall budget deficit throughout the 1970’s.</p>
                        <p>—While Rhodesia has continued to achieve a net surplus on merchandise
                            trade, there has been a marked reduction in the volume and value of
                            trade in relation to national income. The deficit on invisibles has
                            worsened in recent years with the loss of revenue to Rhodesia Railways
                            from Zambian copper exports (since 1973) and with increased trade costs
                            for Rhodesian imports and exports which now must be carried exclusively
                            through South Africa. The current balance has been increasingly in
                            deficit since 1972.</p>
                        <p>—No improvement in factors affecting the current account can be expected
                            during 1976. Foreign indebtedness has increased and foreign exchange
                            reserves are thought to be low. Increasingly stringent import controls
                            have been imposed to contain the situation, which has not only reduced
                            the availability of imported consumer goods but has prevented domestic
                            industry from obtaining sufficient supplies of raw materials, spares and
                            replacement machinery, with which to maintain production levels and
                            efficient services.</p>
                        <p>—While the economy and balance of payments will benefit from the lifting
                            of sanctions and restoration of economic relations with the rest of the
                            world, it should not be assumed that this in itself will produce an
                            early and dramatic improvement in the situation. The re-opening of
                            traditional and cheaper trade routes and the ability to buy and sell
                            overtly in world markets will benefit the terms of trade, although to
                            what extent the invisible deficit will be reduced, for example by the
                            resumption of transit traffic, is not clear given the development of new
                            communications systems in the region over the last decade. It may be
                            assumed that manufacturing industry established in recent years will
                            continue to be afforded some degree of protection and the manufacturing
                            sector should be able to increase exports to neighboring states.
                            However, the demands of the economy for additional imports <pb n="679"
                                facs="0718" xml:id="pg_679"/>will be considerable both for the
                            re-equipment of industry and for public investment. In addition, the
                            structural changes that are likely to take place over the next few years
                            could well result in other calls on foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>—It is evident that a new Zimbabwe government will have serious short
                            term problems in trying to avoid a further decline in domestic economic
                            activity, while at the same time having to face the challenge of
                            formulating and implementing a national development strategy to provide
                            new opportunities for all sections of the population and ensure a wider
                            distribution of the benefits of economic development. Considerable
                            emphasis will have to be placed on education and training for the
                            African majority. A major effort will be necessary to develop the
                            traditional rural sector and integrate it with the rest of the economy;
                            this will require, inter alia, the maintenance of an efficient public
                            administration and essential infrastructure services. Any failure to
                            maintain the production of the modern sector, in particular output both
                            for domestic consumption and also for export from lands at present
                            farmed by Europeans, would seriously undermine the economy and an
                            independent Zimbabwe government’s ability to implement a major economic
                            development program.</p>
                        <p>—The realization of Zimbabwe’s economic potential and the future welfare
                            of the bulk of the population suggests that there should be no early
                            large-scale replacement of European skills, but rather a deliberate
                            change in manpower composition as rapidly as the African majority is
                            able to acquire and deploy the necessary skills. Land reform, following
                            the repeal of the Land Tenure Act, will necessarily be an important
                            feature of a rural development strategy for Zimbabwe. A
                            well-administered and orderly land transfer program will not only
                            facilitate the resettlement of many of those presently confined to the
                            tribal trust and African land purchase areas, but it will also provide
                            the European commercial farming sector with sufficient confidence to
                            encourage them to continue farming in Zimbabwe in a manner that will
                            maintain production and asset values.</p>
                        <p>—The absence of a development plan makes the quantification of the likely
                            resource gap over the next few years impossible at this stage.
                            Investment will clearly have to be expanded considerably. There will
                            probably be some improvement in public sector savings and in the overall
                            allocation of resources following a settlement (with a reduction in
                            defense expenduture). Private capital can be relied upon in some sectors
                            (e.g. mining and manufacturing) and within Zimbabwe’s debt service
                            capacity, commercial capital inflows have a role to play. While it is
                            appreciated that the strength of the economy and its growth potential
                            can produce substantial resources for improving the life of all Zim<pb
                                n="680" facs="0719" xml:id="pg_680"/>babweans, there is no doubt
                            that it will also require substantial concessional aid flows in the
                            years ahead.</p>

                        <p>—The Zimbabwe Development Fund would give support, and help mobilize
                            support from other institutions, for a balanced development program for
                            Zimbabwe. It would work with the Zimbabwe government and other Zimbabwe
                            institutions, bilateral and multilateral development assistance
                            agencies, foreign government agencies that issue or guarantee trade
                            credits or insure private investment, and other appropriate
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>—Details of specific programs that the fund might support can be finally
                            decided only after much more information has become available and after
                            consultations with the Zimbabwe government. It may be desirable for the
                            fund to support an international assistance mission, organized by the
                            World Bank, and drawing on the capabilities of bilateral aid agencies
                            and existing multilateral institutions. This mission could assess more
                            accurately Zimbabwe’s economic development prospects and identify
                            projects and programs that the fund and the international community
                            might support. Those program areas of likely interest to the fund
                            include:</p>
                        <p>(I) public administration and institutional development;</p>
                        <p>(II) agriculture and land reform;</p>
                        <p>(III) commerce, industry and mining;</p>
                        <p>(IV) education and training;</p>
                        <p>(V) social and economic infrastructure; and</p>
                        <p>(VI) international finance.</p>
                        <p>—Support by the fund in these areas might be direct support of specific
                            projects and programs or it might be indirect through general balance of
                            payments support that will enhance the broad capabilities of the
                            Zimbabwe government to undertake projects and programs.</p>
                        <p>Public Administration and Institutional Development</p>
                        <p>—Public and parastatal institutions will have to perform effectively
                            during the transition if the significant development opportunities
                            outlined in Annex I are to be realized. There will be a need to expand
                            rapidly job opportunities for African Zimbabweans in the public sector.
                            Yet much of the existing skilled and managerial personnel may have to be
                            retained, at least for a while, as the demands on an effective
                            functioning civil service are likely to expand during a transition
                            period.</p>

                            While discussed generally in a later section of this Annex, training
                            requirements for the public service and parastatal organizations will
                            probably be a first priority of the new government. Institutes of public
                            administration organized by a new government and other forms of
                            institutional support may merit support from the development fund.</p>
                        <p>—Another requirement will probably be to provide job security and
                            benefits for those civil servants willing to stay and contribute their
                            skills. The Zimbabwe government would be expected to honor existing
                            arrangements for employee benefits, including pensions. General support
                            provided by the Zimbabwe Development Fund should enable the Zimbabwe
                            government to meet the expenses of job security and benefit programs
                            associated with a restructuring of the civil service.</p>
                        <p>Agriculture and Land Reform</p>
                        <p>In Rhodesia there are parallel modern and traditional agricultural
                            sectors. The new government will undoubtedly revise the Land Tenure Act
                            of 1969 with a view to a more balanced and more economic allocation of
                            land, while sustaining production in the modern sector and improving
                            productivity in the traditional.</p>
                        <p>The fund might want to support government programs to increase
                            productivity in the tribal trust lands and the African purchase areas.
                            These lands presently constitute about 45 percent of the area in
                            Rhodesia. They are often dry, endowed with poor soils, over-populated,
                            far from major markets, serviced by inadequate transport links and
                            farmed without modern techniques. Government programs can be envisaged
                            to improve farm practice and technologies; to expand and invigorate
                            extension services; organize the distribution of seed, fertilizer and
                            pesticides; improve transport and marketing facilities; and intensify
                            agricultural research.</p>
                        <p>—The Zimbabwe government will also want to increase the land area farmed
                            by Africans. The 45 percent of the area now reserved for Europeans is
                            much more sparsely settled and not cultivated or grazed as intensively
                            as the tribal trust lands. This should provide opportunities for
                            resettlement. A critical problem to be faced by the new government will
                            be to enhance opportunities for African farmers to acquire and use land
                            in areas formerly reserved for Europeans while at the same time
                            production, exports, and internal revenue derived from the agricultural
                            sector are kept resilient.</p>
                        <p>—The transition to a new ownership structure of land could take a number
                            of different forms. For example, African farmer opportunities could be
                            enhanced through resettlement schemes in which large areas were
                            purchased, subdivided, and reallocated to African farmers. Resettlement
                            schemes of this sort might be accompanied by infrastructure projects for
                            new access roads, villages, health, education and other so<pb n="682"
                                facs="0721" xml:id="pg_682"/>cial services; new agricultural
                            processing facilities; and purchase and production loans for new African
                            farmers.</p>
                        <p>—Another way for Africans to be given enhanced opportunities is through
                            government-financed mortgage schemes in which Africans are given loans
                            to purchase farms in areas now reserved for Europeans. There may be a
                            variety of schemes proposed to effect an orderly process of land
                            transfer and the Zimbabwe Development Fund should be prepared to support
                            a number of them. Projects supported by the fund, of course, would be
                            evaluated in terms of their contribution to economic development and
                            would be expected to provide opportunities for existing owners of farm
                            assets to sell at fair valuation.</p>
                        <p>Commerce, Industry and Mining</p>
                        <p>—Manufacturing, mining, modern commerce and a range of modern service
                            sectors employ over half a million African Zimbabweans and generate over
                            80 percent of recorded <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>. The growth
                            of these sectors is essential to provide employment opportunities and
                            increased income potential for Africans.</p>
                        <p>—The Zimbabwe Development Fund might want to support projects for
                            training of African managers and technical staff; technical advice and
                            support services for African-owned small businesses; and loans to
                            African individuals to purchase existing business establishments.</p>
                        <p>—A substantial portion of the investment needed in modern industry,
                            mining, and commerce, however, is likely to be provided by foreign
                            private capital. The Zimbabwe Development Fund, at the request of the
                            Zimbabwe government, could work with public agencies and private sector
                            groups to facilitate the flow of private capital to an independent
                            Zimbabwe. For example, the fund might work closely with the
                            International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group and the Berne
                            Union Association of Public Agencies that provide export credits,
                            guarantees and investment insurance.</p>
                        <p>Education and Training</p>
                        <p>—Historically, immigration has been the primary source of semi-skilled
                            and managerial labor. Majority rule should bring a large expansion of
                            opportunities for African Zimbabweans in skilled and managerial posts,
                            particularly in the public sector but also in private industry. There
                            are, however, many African Zimbabweans with university degrees who
                            reside out of the country and who may be expected to return home after a
                            settlement. Nevertheless, lack of skilled labor is viewed by many
                            Rhodesians as the primary constraint on rapid economic growth. This
                            constraint could be intensified as the country moves toward majority
                            rule.</p>
                        <p>—Redressing the imbalance in the formal educational system is likely to
                            be a priority concern of the new Zimbabwe government. Sup<pb n="683"
                                facs="0722" xml:id="pg_683"/>port from the Zimbabwe Development Fund
                            may be requested to help redress imbalances in pupil/teacher ratios and
                            in the quality of and facilities for instruction. Support may be
                            requested for a reorientation of the system to give more emphasis to
                            priority areas such as agricultural, vocational and technical skills
                            training.</p>
                        <p>—Informal training might also be strengthened. For example, incentives
                            for on-the-job training and apprentice programs could be supported by
                            the government through taxes or direct subsidy.</p>
                        <p>—The international community could move rapidly to support programs in
                            education and training after the Zimbabwe Development Fund is
                            established. Initial efforts may have to concentrate on a crash program
                            of training in public administration and management.</p>
                        <p>Social and Economic Infrastructure</p>
                        <p>—Social infrastructure programs are likely to receive considerable
                            attention by an independent Zimbabwe government. For example, there will
                            probably be emphasis on expanding health and nutrition programs for
                            Africans in both rural and urban areas. Community centers and adult
                            education facilities may be expanded.</p>
                        <p>—Another area of importance will be housing. Government-sponsored
                            programs of low cost housing and site and services projects may merit
                            support by the Zimbabwe Development Fund.</p>
                        <p>—As Zimbabwe moves toward independence, Embassies will be established,
                            foreign business firms will seek opportunities for investment, and
                            technicians and representatives of international agencies may come to
                            Zimbabwe. This may increase sharply the demand for residential housing,
                            despite fears of some that housing values would be threatened by a
                            transition to majority rule. In order to enable Zimbabwe Africans to
                            have access on reasonable terms to housing in residential areas now
                            exclusively occupied by Europeans and to preserve a stable and orderly
                            housing market, various government programs may be required. This might
                            include a facility to provide home mortgages for Africans. The facility
                            might also provide opportunities for home owners to sell, on a basis of
                            valuation to be determined, during a transition period.</p>
                        <p>The maintenance and continued development of Rhodesian economic
                            infrastructure is vital to the country’s economy and critical to the
                            economies of neighboring countries. It will be particularly important to
                            assess the current structure in terms of the economy after transition.
                            Previous imbalance may suggest new trunk road development, for example,
                            but will certainly suggest major investment in feeder roads, rural
                            electrification and village water supplies. The requirements associated
                            with agricultural settlement will be particularly important and
                            immediate.</p>
                        <pb n="684" facs="0723" xml:id="pg_684"/>
                        <p>—With regard to the transport structure, it may be necessary to import
                            new supplies of rail and road equipment and spare parts. The lifting of
                            economic sanctions should allow Zimbabwe to reestablish import and
                            export routes now closed, in particular through Mozambique to Beira.
                            Development efforts may be directed at enhancing capacity to use
                            these.</p>
                        <p>International Finance</p>
                        <p>—During the period 1968 to 1974, the Rhodesian economy was remarkably
                            strong. Real <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> grew at an annual rate
                            of 8.3 percent. Inflation was held to under 4 percent per year. While
                            there has been greater inflation and little or no growth in the last two
                            years, the growth potential of the economy continues to exist. Assuming
                            transition to majority rule will bring a reopening of Zimbabwe’s
                            borders, without major dislocation, a return to a high growth pattern
                            seems likely. Opening of the borders should stimulate the economy
                            through easier and cheaper transportation and the opening of potential
                            export markets for her new consumer and intermediate and capital goods
                            industries.</p>
                        <p>—Although domestic saving rates have been exceptional, foreign exchange
                            availabilities have been limited because of sanctions. With the lifting
                            of sanctions, demands will be made for the input of foreign capital and
                            resumption of normal remittances. The provision of substantial
                            concessional assistance by the fund could assist the Zimbabwe government
                            in restoring a more normal international payments and trading regime,
                            thereby enabling it to take full advantage of the lifting of sanctions
                            and the restoration of economic relations with the rest of the world and
                            to honor its international financial obligations.</p>
                        <p>—The measures described earlier in this annex should themselves provide a
                            large measure of economic improvement and security for the African
                            communities. It will be no less important for the fund to take into
                            account the balance of payments implication of such measures designed by
                            the Zimbabwe government to encourage skilled elements of the population
                            to remain in an independent Zimbabwe to help to sustain and expand the
                            economy. In particular, the restoration of a more normal international
                            payments and trading regime would itself permit the government to
                            maintain an appropriate foreign exchange remittance facility. Thus, the
                            experienced farmer or worker who had decided in the light of the
                            measures proposed, to remain in the country for a number of years should
                            be able to do so in the confidence that if he eventually decided to
                            depart, his savings could be remitted abroad at least over a specified
                            period.</p>

                        <p>[The Secretary and Mr. Richard exchanged small talk about
                            football—European and American—over cocktails, and moved to luncheon at
                            1:40. Discussion about football continued.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How should we conduct
                            this discussion, Ivor?</p>
                        <p>Richard: I should lead off.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You should?</p>
                        <p>Richard: You should.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But you’re going on
                            the trip!</p>
                        <p>I had a paper which showed how you took care of all our points.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Oh, we took enormous
                            care.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We thought it was
                            substantially the same as the earlier paper.</p>
                        <p>Richard: The voting mechanism now gives them a blocking third.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Unless the Resident
                            Commissioner votes with the others.</p>
                        <p>Richard: If it’s a special thing, there will then be 31 people entitled
                            to vote, and it will take 21 votes to carry. If he doesn’t vote, it will
                            take 10 votes to block it.</p>
                        <pb n="686" facs="0725" xml:id="pg_686"/>
                        <p>We’ve also looked at the way the Resident Commissioner will preside and
                            not preside, to make it nearer to the Council of State. Also, the right
                            to call for a special vote.</p>
                        <p>There is one gap—to deal with economic side, the assurances—to make them
                            the subject of a special vote. So they can have a blocking vote on
                            things like nationalization with compensation, major changes in land
                            tenure.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: Unless the Resident
                            Commissioner votes with the black side.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Or some whites.</p>
                        <p>Richard: I don’t see how you can have ten members of the Rhodesian
                            Front.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: Can you check them
                            with the Rhodesian Front?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: We also have to think of
                            an independent Zimbabwe. There are a lot of whites who will want to
                            stay, and non-Front people. We will have to think of some way for them
                            to be represented.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You are assuming no
                            Rhodesian Front people will stay?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: No, but they [the others]
                            should have some representation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the question Jack
                            asked is whether some should be checked with the Rhodesian Front.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Checked, but no veto.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: The people from the
                            Rhodesia Party are 18% of the vote.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How would they
                            vote?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: The Rhodesia Party’s view
                            is the blacks should have the politics and the whites should have the
                            privilege, to put it crudely. So they’d likely vote with the Front.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me ask. Full
                            independence will come the 1st of March 1978. You can’t get it set up by
                            the end of February 1977.</p>
                        <p>Richard: We can’t. We’ll need five or six weeks to get the necessary
                            legislation passed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think you’ll take
                            longer in Africa than you think?</p>
                        <p>Richard: I think so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: So you won’t
                            reassemble until after our inauguration. Assuming everything went
                            splendidly in Africa—which would be an historic first—[laughter] you’re
                            setting up this cumbersome thing. You won’t get it set up until
                            April.</p>
                        <p>Richard: That’s the date set now. But we may or may not be able to get it
                            into ten or eleven months. They’ll have elections.</p>
                        <p>Why do you say the machinery will be cumbersome?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’ll have to replace
                            the Chiefs of Staff . . .</p>
                        <pb n="687" facs="0726" xml:id="pg_687"/>
                        <p>Richard: That won’t take long. They will be all lined up first. It won’t
                            be so hard to set up the Council of Ministers, the Advisory Council, and
                            National Security Council.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: I think the 1st of March
                            date is unrealistic. We’re running into lots of problems. There will be
                            a great deal of horse-trading, politics, which will be of critical
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>Richard: You find the structure unwieldy, unbalanced?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me explain what
                            our problems are—which we approach from the point of view of being
                            helpful, as facing a common problem. It may sound strange coming from
                            me, but I feel we have a point of honor here. We’ve had occasions in the
                            past when we made a promise to someone and were not able to carry it out
                            because circumstances prevented it. But I’ve never actually made a
                            promise and never tried to carry it out.</p>
                        <p>I told them I’d never push them beyond Annex C. Maybe I shouldn’t have,
                            but Annex C seemed so compatible with what the Africans were willing to
                            accept. Even the five points. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                            >Kaunda</persName>—and even <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                            >Nkomo</persName>. They wanted a little adjustment here, a little
                            adjustment there. Maybe one instead of two ministers.</p>
                        <p>It disintegrated for many reasons, including the disunity of the
                            Africans.</p>
                        <p>This is why it will be hard to go back to the South Africans and claim we
                            tried Annex C.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Why? We were trying to sell Annex C in all our bilateral
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well . . . The second
                            problem is what will happen to your plan even if it is accepted. Will it
                            create an Angola-type situation? Will it require such massive pressure
                            that there will be a white exodus? This isn’t a criticism of your
                            plan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: It depends, first, on the
                            willingness of the four Presidents, whether they will support it.
                            Second, and perhaps more important, is one’s estimate of <gloss
                                target="#t_ZIPA_1">ZIPA</gloss>. I just don’t believe <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>’s analysis that they’ve got
                            4–5,000 well-trained men and only 1,000 will go back.</p>
                        <p>Richard: They are school children and will go back to school.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: They’re not the <gloss
                                target="#t_MPLA_1">MPLA</gloss>, who have been fighting for ten
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Squire: Are they battle-hardened Marxists really, the negotiators at
                            Geneva?</p>
                        <p>Richard: I see your Angolan point. But it all depends on the four
                            Presidents. Either you’re saying they will agree to something they won’t
                            enforce . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It won’t be the first
                            time.</p>
                        <pb n="688" facs="0727" xml:id="pg_688"/>
                        <p>Richard: If you don’t get their full backing, nothing will work. If you
                            do get their backing, there will have to be fairly cast-iron guarantees
                            on both sides.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your plan of
                            procedure? I see you helpfully wrote our talking points for the South
                                Africans.<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">Not further
                            identified.</note></p>
                        <p>Richard: You asked us to!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But what will you tell
                            the black Presidents?</p>
                        <p>Richard: I’ll tell them the nationalists need reassurance that the
                            process will be irreversible, that the whites need reassurance that it
                            will be orderly. That we see no way to do this without a British
                            presence, with a Resident Commissioner in charge of drafting of the
                            constitution, etc., that he will hold the balance of power between the
                            two sides. I don’t see how they can object since it is what they’ve been
                            asking us for for years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [laughs:] On my first
                            trip to Africa, <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> said
                            “Just get Smith to declare for majority rule—the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> transition, two years.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Or more.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Or more! Now they’ve
                            got 500% more.</p>
                        <p>Richard: But they still think Smith isn’t committed to it. When Smith
                            steps out and says “The only purpose of this Conference is to choose the
                            Council of State.” That’s ridiculous.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We told him not to
                            submit Annex C because it would be rejected.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Sure. But they genuinely don’t believe he’s committed to it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is this true, or a

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: I think it’s true.</p>
                        <p>Richard: I think it’s true.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>:] Is it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: It’s probably
                            true.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We went through the
                            same on Namibia. We got 1000% of what they asked.</p>
                        <p>Richard: They told me they want a commitment to majority rule—an
                            irreversible transfer of power—if not one man one vote. We presented
                            this to Smith and Smith said fine. We got our lawyers to draft something
                            like this. We presented this to Smith and Smith rejected it, and said
                            the only purpose of the Conference is to name the Council of State.
                            There was no attempt at all to bridge the gap.</p>

                        <p>You feel he’s been misled. I fear that we and you have been misled
                            because he’s not really interested in majority rule within two years.
                            Because he’s done damn all for it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: He goes back to Rhodesia
                            and winks at his supporters and says “We’ll try this but in the interim
                            we get sanctions lifted, and arms.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Pretoria, I thought
                            he acted for nine hours as a man who knew his days were numbered, and
                            who wanted to get the best transition possible.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Then why did he act as he did in Geneva?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I can’t say. He felt
                            two years was too short. When the first issue, which was unambiguously
                            stated—the <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> plan, two
                            years—slipped off, he probably figured everything he agreed to would
                            slip away.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: This is the way he always
                            acts. He slips off a hook and you have to get him on another.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose the Africans
                            say they don’t accept this?</p>
                        <p>Richard: It depends on what grounds.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They don’t want a
                            blocking veto.</p>
                        <p>Richard: We’ll say a veto for the British Commissioner.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Suppose they say they
                            want majority rule now?</p>
                        <p>Richard: They can’t have it. We’re not prepared to give majority rule
                            until after elections. We’re prepared to transfer power now away from
                            the Rhodesian Front to a British Commissioner.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In Pretoria—unless he
                            and his men are the greatest actors—they acted as people whose structure
                            was broken.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RCW_1">Robinson</persName>: But we’ve now weakened
                            the interim government to the point where it’s no assurance.</p>
                        <p>Richard: The British Commissioner is there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But, to put it
                            crudely, that depends on how they see the British Commissioner. If they
                            see it just as another black vote . . .</p>
                        <p>Richard: They’ll have to bite that bullet.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: They have to face the
                            reality.</p>
                        <p>Squire: It’s a matter of <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor
                                Richard</persName>. If Lord Home were in the Foreign Office, they’d
                            like it better.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: True.</p>
                        <p>Richard: But there is no likelihood that will happen for some time!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: They are going around
                            telling people: “Don’t worry. It will all come out right. We’ll get the
                            sanctions lifted.” That’s not good faith.</p>
                        <pb n="690" facs="0729" xml:id="pg_690"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is not the first
                            time a political leader sells a program to his people—to keep them
                            calm—with arguments that wouldn’t be too attractive to blacks.</p>
                        <p>Richard: I understand that. But he accepted majority rule, genuinely or
                            not.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He understands that he
                            accepted it under duress.</p>
                        <p>Richard: All right. He now would want to create the maximum orderly
                            transition. So, he could respond to one proposal with proposals of his
                            own. The original wasn’t acceptable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Whether or not it was
                            a Cabinet paper! We’ll give you more support than you gave to your own
                            paper!</p>
                        <p>If I had stayed there, if I had to do it over again, I would have got the
                            frontline Presidents signed up. Maybe not the nationalists. But they
                            told us this was what they wanted. We’re doing the same on Namibia
                            now.</p>
                        <p>Richard: If he genuinely wants it, he should come forward with
                            alternative proposals for the same result.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’ll go to the
                            frontline Presidents first.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Two of them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’re seeing
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> tonight. What will you
                            say?</p>
                        <p>Richard: That those proposals were drawn up as a substitute for a British
                            presence. You remember how it was drawn up. So it’s clearly a
                            change.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My advice is to show
                            this to the South Africans—not to the Rhodesians. Our intelligence is
                            that they didn’t show the five points to the Rhodesians for some time.
                            If you go around Africa without telling the South Africans what bill
                            they’ll be presented with, you’d face insuperable obstacles.</p>
                        <p>Richard: We thought you would present it to the South Africans.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: [to Richard:] I was at
                            Geneva with you. I saw some pitfalls in your approach. He was prepared
                            for majority rule in two years. Then, the issue that was undisputed was
                            watered down.</p>
                        <p>Richard: That’s a debating point, but I really don’t think there is any
                            substance in it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Why not?</p>
                        <p>Richard: We gave nothing away. The date doesn’t mean anything because
                            it’s agreed that the constitutional processes have to be finished.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What if the blacks
                            kick out the Resident Commissioner?</p>
                        <p>Richard: We won’t give independence. We don’t have to sanction it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the reality is at
                            some point you will sanction it.</p>

                        <p>Squire: The risk is there. The blacks can cheat and so can the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: <gloss target="#t_ZIPA_1"
                                >ZIPA</gloss> isn’t such a problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then why should Smith
                            negotiate?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Because he’ll lose in the
                            long run.</p>
                        <p>Squire: Like with the Israelis, casualties for them are serious.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But the Israelis don’t
                            think they’ll lose.</p>
                        <p>Richard: You asked him if his situation would be any better in six
                            months. That’s still true.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The South Africans
                            certainly saw it this way. Their pressure was the decisive factor. But
                            the might decide this is a game they don’t want to play again. We don’t
                            give a damn about Rhodesia. The only reason we got into it is to set a
                            pattern for the rest of Africa.</p>
                        <p>Richard: You still can do that. There are a lot of moderates sitting
                            around who can take over Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When will you present

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When will it be

                        <p>Squire: As long as we get US support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We’ll give you as much

                        <p>Richard: Today with <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> I can
                            lift the veil a bit.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t care whether
                            you do it through <persName corresp="#p_SDA_1">Scott</persName> in South
                            Africa or through <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> here.
                            The advantage of doing it here is you can explain it better than
                                <persName corresp="#p_SDA_1">Scott</persName> can. I thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_SDA_1">Scott</persName> was excellent; this is
                            no reflection on him. We were worried about how to instruct our
                            Ambassadors following you around. We despaired of explaining to our

                        <p>Richard: No problem. There is no room on the plane unfortunately, because
                            it’s a small plane.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: A small plane or a

                        <p>Richard: A small plane!</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We won’t tell the

                            support it. Whether we’d be prepared to impose sanctions is another
                            matter. If there is any trouble with the <pb n="692" facs="0731"
                                xml:id="pg_692"/>South Africans, I don’t want it said we didn’t
                            present the plan properly. So I think it should be presented by the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [to Richard:] We’ll
                            make sure it’s a smaller plane than yours. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Squire: Suppose Ivor were to talk to the South African today on the basis
                            of the talking points you’ve seen. When would you be prepared to follow
                            up?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Friday.<note n="4"

                            Then you can’t be accused of running off with consulting them.</p>
                        <p>I predict they’ll neither accept it nor reject it.</p>
                        <p>Richard: They’ll send it back to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> and think about it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When did you think of
                            getting to South Africa?</p>
                        <p>Richard: The 9th or 10th. Not with a paper, just ideas.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: At any time will you
                            leave a paper?</p>
                        <p>Richard: The second time around.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: Will you see the
                            nationalists?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Where will you find
                            them?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: They have all indicated
                            they want to see him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I think it’s very
                            important that you not get into the position where you’re talking about
                            the least that the Africans will accept. You have to leave some
                            maneuvering room.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: There is this four
                            Presidents’ meeting next week.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Will you go there
                            before?</p>
                        <p>Richard: They want me to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Are you going to?</p>
                        <p>Richard: No. They’ll just knock it down. I was thinking of going there
                            while the Presidents were meeting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s risky. When is
                            that meeting?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Between Christmas and

                        <pb n="693" facs="0732" xml:id="pg_693"/>
                        <p>Richard: It would be quite monstrous if in the end the Patriotic Front
                            came out in top when the Bishop has the votes. There is no question the
                            Bishop has the votes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: This is how <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> is talking. They’re wrong.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> wants <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>. Why does <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> then? One thing I’ve learned is
                            they usually know how to take care of their own survival.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: He hasn’t got any
                            guerrillas of his own. And it’s a misreading of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Richard: One result of the date row was that <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName>’s position was weakened. He said he had to go
                            back to Mozambique to get “new instructions.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Isn’t <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> in Saudi Arabia?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: He’ll be back. We’ll have
                            to go to Mozambique. They will never meet except together.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> could probably produce him in
                            one of his back rooms.</p>
                        <p>The problem is how the black leaders will see this. Whether it looks like
                            our final position, or whether it will be another Annex C.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: They never saw Annex C,
                            did they?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But I thought that on
                            every mission we talked the substance of Annex C.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: The substance. That’s
                            right.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Smith told me several times he had never seen the text of Annex
                            C until after he left Pretoria.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s technically
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>We told him the five points were a summary of the paper, and it was a
                            joint paper between you and us that we would stand behind. He went back
                            to Salisbury and left his man there for a day to work on the economic
                            paper. We gave it to him that evening. So Smith got it by Monday
                            morning, before his caucus meeting. He never said “I’ve read Annex C and
                            it’s unacceptable.”</p>
                        <p>He wanted those two Ministers and the white chairman. After talking to
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>, I figured Smith
                            should put it in rather than surface it later when it would look like a
                            secret deal. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> looked at it
                            and said, “It’s a miracle. You’ve done it. It’s over!” [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>So I cabled Smith that in my opinion he could put it in. I didn’t say
                            we’d back it; I didn’t say <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> had accepted it. <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> was anguished and had some problems but on things
                            like the ministers. Nothing major.</p>
                        <p>Richard: One other question that has cropped up. Smith tried to get you
                            to say “responsible” majority rule. He said you agreed.</p>
                        <pb n="694" facs="0733" xml:id="pg_694"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s not correct. I
                            don’t even think I said it to Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I think you did.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I must have.</p>
                        <p>Richard: I asked <persName corresp="#p_VBPK_1">Van der Byl</persName>:
                            How many white voters are there? He said 90,000. I said “You can’t
                            enfranchise 100,000 blacks and call it majority rule.” He said “what
                            about 150,000?” This is how he’s thinking.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How many would Annex B
                                enfranchise?<note n="5" xml:id="d235fn5">Annex B of the British

                        <p>Richard: Oh, three million.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I may have said it
                            wouldn’t be more than <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>’s
                            plan. But no further.</p>
                        <p>Are you going to Salisbury?</p>
                        <p>Richard: Yes, before Pretoria.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Before?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: We wanted the South
                            Africans’ advice on this. At this moment they’ve suggested this. Because
                            of the Christmas holidays.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But I think it’s a lot
                            better to let the South Africans present it to Smith, or prepare
                            Smith.</p>
                        <p>Richard: Some softening-up process would be good.</p>
                        <p>Squire: This is where we would want Pik <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1"
                                >Botha</persName>’s views.</p>
                        <p>Do I understand it: On the first round what you said to Smith was
                            critical, after talking to the South Africans. On this round, should we
                            put it to Smith?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we didn’t deal
                            with Smith. I refused to talk to him until the South Africans had
                            prepared him.</p>
                        <p>Richard: You’ll put this to the South Africans and urge them to support
                            this?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. But I wouldn’t
                            talk to Smith first. Tactically I think you’re better off seeing the
                            South Africans first.</p>
                        <p>Richard: I’d like to see Smith. I’d also like to see the Bishop in
                            Salisbury.</p>
                        <p>Squire: [to Richard:] You’ll have a free day before Salisbury to allow a

                        <p>Richard: Yes.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I think <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: Yes. But we don’t want
                            early on to give the impression we’re trying to split him from <persName

                        <p>Richard: I saw Joshua alone, between us, about four times in Geneva. On
                            the whole, you’re a lot better off seeing him alone; he’s
                            reasonable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The Africans have
                            impressed me with their cold-blooded appreciation of power. I wouldn’t
                            assume he’s made a mistake; I’d ask what it is that makes him think it’s
                            in his interest.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GD_1">Grennan</persName>: He assumes he can control
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>. That’s I think his
                            mistake.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That I agree.</p>
                        <p>You will brief <persName corresp="#p_EWB_1">Edmondson</persName>?</p>
                        <p>Richard: Yes, every day. We’ll show him everything.</p>

                        <p>Richard: Yes, tomorrow.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He may not want to
                            take a position. We didn’t have these papers when he was in town.</p>
                        <p>Richard: But he can see them as far as we’re concerned.</p>
                        <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andy Young</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: How is he?</p>
                        <p>Richard: Fine, but he will have problems. As soon as he gets instructions
                            to veto Chapter VII sanctions, as he sure as hell will, it will be a
                            problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I wouldn’t say he

                        <p>Richard: I’ll tell him the new element is to inject a British
                            presence.</p>
                        <p>Squire: Ivor, did you want to ask the Secretary about public
                            guidance?</p>
                        <p>Richard: I think it should be much the same as you and <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: And you gave me your
                            impressions on your trip.</p>
                        <p>Squire: And when he sees <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Cy Vance</persName>,
                            would it help to talk about continuity of policy?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You’d have to ask him.
                            I have no objection whatever.</p>
                        <p>Richard: It would be very helpful.</p>
                        <p>Squire: It would help allay some suspicions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I have no problem with

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Did Richard present
                            his ideas?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Yes. He wants to see my
                            Prime Minister. My Prime Minister will see him on January 3. But he’ll
                            have to go down there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: To the Transkei.
                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The way he put it to me, I
                            must say, wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me tell you the
                            history of it. They had something which was as bad as it could be. Then
                            we sent <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWB_1">Edmondson</persName> there to work on it.</p>
                        <p>It’s now as far as I think we can push them.</p>
                        <p>A lot depends on what the British Resident Commissioner will in fact do.
                            Whatever they call it.</p>
                        <pb n="697" facs="0736" xml:id="pg_697"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RPW_1">Rodman</persName>: Interim Commissioner.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Is that what you
                            understood? If the Resident Commissioner votes with the whites, there is
                            a blocking vote.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: I asked him where the
                            power would be. He said: Although we can’t say it publicly, it’s this
                            guy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s more or less
                            true. First, these Ministers will be a mess. Each delegation picks four.
                            In the plan they gave us, the judiciary and civil service stay in place,
                            and the military, except for some senior officers. It votes by majority,
                            except when someone asks for a special vote. Any of the communities, or
                            the Resident Commissioner, can ask for one.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Who can call for it?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Any of the
                            communities. When there is a special vote, the council becomes 31. So
                            the Resident Commissioner, by abstaining or voting with the whites, can
                            block it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: This is far worse.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Than the Council of
                            State, which no longer exists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: But the Council of
                            Ministers.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That required a
                            two-thirds vote. Theoretically, the whites could block it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: He didn’t give me these
                            details. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What did he give you?
                            I don’t believe in playing around.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: He said there was a
                            blocking third. He didn’t tell me they have it only when the
                            Commissioner votes with you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He said theirs could
                            be five members of the Rhodesian Front. Then the Resident Commissioner
                            appoints five more whites. First it was required that they be
                            non-Rhodesian Front. We protested this, and now it’s three Rhodesian
                            Front. So it depends on whether the whites stick together.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They won’t. If they pick
                            people like Todd, they’ll vote with the blacks, with the powers that
                            will be.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: This is how they
                            presented it. On the basis that the non-Rhodesian Front got 20 percent
                            of the vote.</p>
                        <p>Don’t go back to Richard with these.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: I won’t be seeing him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then there is the
                            National Security Council, composed of five ministers who represent the
                            five delegations in Geneva, plus the Resident Commissioner, plus the
                            three Chiefs of Staff. They’ll be British. They would proceed by
                            majority. Here the whites have a blocking majority.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: How?</p>
                        <pb n="698" facs="0737" xml:id="pg_698"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: There are three
                            Britishers—the Chiefs of Staff—plus the Resident Commissioner, plus the
                            Rhodesian Front man. Five to four.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Do you count him? Just
                            because his skin is white?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s how they
                            present it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: These Chiefs of Staff . .
                            .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: . . . will vote with
                            the Resident Commissioner.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Sure. Did we define who
                            these chiefs of law and order will be [in the Five Points]?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we never did. We
                            just said they had to be European.</p>
                        <p>This is 300 percent better than what they presented. They wanted the
                            Chiefs of Staff to be from the Commonwealth, with one Indian, one
                            Nigerian, and one Canadian.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: It would have been
                            useless.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now they can be
                            British.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: This would be the body
                            with the power.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Defense and law and
                            order.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: That’s all?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Sanctions would be lifted and the guerrilla war would end. That’s still
                            in the plan. And the Army wouldn’t return to Rhodesia in the interim
                            period.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: They would be
                            demobilized and go back to school.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They can’t return to
                            Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, not in the interim
                            period. That’s the whole point of the scheme.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Formerly, the Council of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The question is if it

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right. I told
                            Richard—contrary to the public mythology, I believe in telling everyone
                            the same thing—that I was concerned about two things. One, we had given
                            our word on Annex C, and in eight years in public office I’d never
                            broken my word. Second, we were afraid if it broke down, it would be an
                            Angola-type situation.</p>
                        <p>He said he had tried Annex C in bilateral talks and failed. And he’s of
                            the view it couldn’t be resurrected. This is the view of <persName
                                corresp="#p_WFG_1">Frank Wisner</persName> also. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName> believes if the British had
                            gone immediately to the heart of the problem and avoided the date issue,
                            Annex C could have been accepted. But he believes that it now can’t be
                            accepted.</p>
                        <p>As for an Angola situation, Richard believes it could break down. He
                            says, with respect to the former, he’s done all he can. With respect to
                            the latter, he says he’ll get ironclad assurance from the Presidents
                            that there will be no factional strife.<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">See

                            deeply imbedded in the British attitude.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Mr. Secretary, we have one
                            major problem as I see it. I have not given this to my Prime Minister. I
                            was afraid he would refuse to see him. I couldn’t tell him
                            telephonically. I told him “just listen to it.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s the best
                            thing.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The problem is: Smith was
                            on the point of accepting Annex C at Geneva.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look, Geneva was
                            massively mismanaged. I don’t know why they picked the one issue that
                            was never ambiguous and never challenged.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: He said to me—Richard—the
                            blacks are suspicious of Smith, because he always says things that alarm
                            them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s probably
                            true.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: And that he doesn’t really
                            intend to do it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They got hold of a
                            document that has him saying to his caucus: Just go through this for two
                            years, then we’ll have a new <gloss target="#t_UDI_1">UDI</gloss>. If he
                            said that, he’s a fool.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: We were prepared to act
                            not as witness but as . . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: . . . guarantor. I
                            don’t believe <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> would go
                            as far as he did and not hold him to it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: We would have made him go
                            through with it.</p>
                        <pb n="700" facs="0739" xml:id="pg_700"/>
                        <p>But we’ve now been robbed; he can now tell us this was the agreement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You have to make your
                            decision on the basis that this is the best that can be achieved. And
                            that is the basis of what Smith should decide. This isn’t a debating
                            course in high school.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: What do you see as the
                            basis?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I told Richard we
                            would give support, but no pressure, for this plan.</p>
                        <p>The basis is: The whites plus the Resident Commissioner have a blocking
                            vote. And a majority on the National Security Council. Law and order can
                            also be taken care of by splitting the ministries between them.</p>
                        <p>As late as early November, the blacks in my view would have settled for a
                            British chairman of the Council of State and splitting the ministries.
                            With some consultative mechanism.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But then the British
                            weren’t ready for a role, and they raised the issue of the date.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: So the basis is there is
                            no better alternative.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: But he can say this isn’t
                            what was agreed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But what are Smith’s
                            alternatives?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Mr. Secretary, they don’t
                            believe us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They believe they can
                            win.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They believe they can
                            withstand any black onslaught. They have 20,000 men in reserve, which
                            they haven’t touched yet. They think they can do it unless there is
                            massive Soviet-Cuban intervention. Which they think is unlikely, or that
                            you would intervene.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I were here, yes,
                            but I wouldn’t count on it with my successors.</p>
                        <p>I sent scorching letters to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>.<note n="3"

                            Which probably I shouldn’t have—because it made me the villain.</p>
                        <p>They now don’t want to convene while I am in office.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s when they came
                            up with this idea of keeping the judiciary and civil service in place,
                            and keeping the guerrillas out.</p>
                        <pb n="701" facs="0740" xml:id="pg_701"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They gave you this in

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, orally.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, London.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: I’ll be going back to

                            I’d be going back to South Africa and my Prime Minister would be asking
                            me if I’d seen him. So he said all right.</p>
                        <p>So, as far as you know, it’s part of the plan to retain the civil service
                            and the judiciary unaltered.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He spoke too damn
                            much.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I have to say, Pik,
                            about this National Security Council, given the British unwillingness to
                            have the troops there, and their love of law and order, they’ll be more
                            objective on the National Security Council than elsewhere.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with Bill on
                            that. They’ll play around perhaps on political issues.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: He said there would be
                            assurances against factional strife?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They don’t have the
                            power.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Don’t you think
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Muzorewa</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> will sit down together? [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They’ll be after each
                            other, bribing and fighting.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Really? [Laughter]
                            Don’t they just want what is the best for their people?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: My Prime Minister will say
                            it’s a new Angola situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ve come reluctantly
                            to the conclusion this is the best that can be gotten. Any more will
                            make us the fall guy and not change the plan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: He’ll say to my Prime
                            Minister: You told me you wouldn’t push us beyond Annex C. We’ve kept
                            saying it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Then he’ll have to
                            fight. And against us too.</p>
                        <p>He’s obviously briefed <persName corresp="#p_CR_1">Clark</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCC_1">Diggs</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Can I tell my Prime
                            Minister you would have stuck to Annex C?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. But that’s not
                            the issue. If I were still in office, I would have taken over the
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: If Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> had won, you’d have pushed Annex
                            C.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We did anyway. I’ll
                            show you the letter I wrote to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: What do they say when you
                            say this was the basis?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They evade it. They
                            say it was all on the assumption that Smith would be overthrown. Which I
                            never told them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Richard says there is
                            no assurance of irreversibility with Smith there.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Let’s go down to my
                            office and I’ll show you my letters to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: May I ask you, Mr.
                            Secretary? Ivor told me they never were committed to it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Bullshit. Excuse
                            me.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: I said really? Ivor said:
                            You’re putting me in a difficult position. His man, Squire then
                            answered. He said they weren’t carrying the <pb n="703" facs="0742"
                                xml:id="pg_703"/>ball then. I said: You mean you never consulted
                            with the Americans? Ivor said yes, we and the Americans developed it,
                            but it always had on top of it: “Paper for discussion.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: They’re still saying
                            it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: When I went to Zurich,
                            I stopped in London and they gave us this paper. I gave it verbatim to
                            your Prime Minister. Even the spelling was British.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Your Prime Minister
                            had some comments on it and I went back to London. I met in the Cabinet
                            Room with <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>. They had problems which I
                            immediately transferred to you. They wanted equality on the Council of
                            State. We ended up with that and with a black majority on the Council of
                            Ministers.</p>
                        <p>It’s a totally dishonorable procedure. I am willing to go along with the
                            idea that, however we got here, it’s no longer possible to negotiate
                            Annex C.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: That’s another
                            question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s right. But they
                            can’t now claim they had nothing to do with it.</p>
                        <p>I am not amused by what the British are saying.</p>
                        <p>I want to show you my letters. So you know we made a massive effort.</p>
                        <p>[The Secretary took Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1"
                                >Botha</persName> to his office where they conferred alone from 9:42

                        <p>2. “Dear Mr. President: I have been in frequent communication with the
                            British Government and have followed closely Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor Richard</persName>’s mission to southern
                            Africa. I continue to hope that he will be able to develop with you,
                            your colleagues the front line presidents, the Zimbabwean nationalists,
                            the Salisbury authorities and the South Africans an acceptable basis for
                            reconvening the conference in Geneva and proceeding to a settlement of
                            the Zimbabwean question.</p>
                        <p>3. I need hardly tell you that the United States retains an intense
                            interest in a solution to the problem of Zimbabwe. We remain committed
                            to the rapid achievement of majority rule within the period agreed to at
                            the Geneva conference. As I wrote you from London on December 11,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">See <ref target="#d233fn5">footnote 5,
                                    Document 233</ref>.</note> we support the formation of a
                            transitional government which will have majority African representation.
                            Britain’s willingness to play an important role during transition is the
                            new element in the settlement which you have sought. I understand
                            Ambassador Richard is describing in detail British views on this
                            subject. The British have our full backing and will continue to receive
                            our support.</p>
                        <p>4. The British proposals, which you are considering, are nevertheless a
                            substantial departure from the framework we originally developed which
                            brought Smith to Geneva. Some means to bridge the gap between the new
                            British position and the original framework must be found if we are to
                            achieve rapidly the settlement we all seek. The information available to
                            me indicates that one way to bridge the gap could be a commitment that
                            once an interim government has been formed and installed in office the
                            war would come to an end. An indication of this nature, I believe, could
                            help to improve the atmosphere in Pretoria and Salisbury and may make it
                            easier to elicit the acceptance of the new British proposals. A
                            guarantee of this nature would make it easier for us to use our
                            influence in Pretoria and Salisbury and work towards an acceptance of a
                            new framework for a Zimbabwean settlement.</p>
                        <p>5. In the days ahead, and especially at the time the front line
                            presidents meet in Lusaka, great importance will be attached to public
                            statements which follow your deliberations. An indication that the
                            search for peace underlines all our objectives would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>6. I understand that you and your fellow presidents will also be
                            discussing the Namibian situation. The United States remains firmly <pb
                                n="705" facs="0744" xml:id="pg_705"/>committed to a peaceful
                            settlement of the Namibian question and an outcome which will guarantee
                            the full independence of Namibia. Much time has passed, but I believe
                            the proposals I have discussed with you in the past still offer an
                            acceptable basis for an agreement. I continue to hold to the view that
                            the South African Government could be persuaded to accept a firm date
                            for Namibian independence, a meeting under <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> auspices of Namibian parties, including <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> at an acceptable international
                            site and a substantial release of political prisoners. As I have told
                            you before, the present Windhoek conference would only send a
                            representative delegation and South Africa would send a representative
                            who would negotiate all issues concerning Namibia’s relations with South
                            Africa. It is my hope that the President of <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> and your colleagues will give these proposals serious
                            consideration. They will, in my judgment, lead inevitably to Namibian
                            independence and secure <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>’s
                            position. If you, the presidents and <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> agree this is the course to pursue, the United States
                            will use its influence to make sure these vital objectives are
                            achieved.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I just thought before
                            I left we could have a brief discussion. Where do we stand?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Richard is in Nairobi.

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What is your
                            assessment, Mr. Ambassador?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Have you been informed of
                            what transpired between my Prime Minister and Richard?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I’ve heard three
                            versions. Richard’s version to our people, Richard’s version to London,
                            and yours by phone. Could we have the correct version now?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FBG_1">Fourie</persName> and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH_1">Muller</persName> were there, and I informed my
                            Prime Minister fully on our last meeting, the breakfast we had before
                                Christmas.<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">See <ref target="#d236"
                                    >Document 236</ref>.</note> I made it clear to my Prime Minister
                            that you had sent messages to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> trying to remind them of what they had said. I
                            made it very clear you did what you could, but when President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> lost the election, you no longer
                            could affect the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked me about the policy of the new administration. I
                            told him I’d seen Mr. Vance but it was too early to tell. He said they
                            were still studying. He did say—I won’t read too much into it—that they
                            would take positive note of any constructive role we played on Rhodesia
                            and South-West Africa.</p>
                        <pb n="707" facs="0746" xml:id="pg_707"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: That’s a good position
                            for him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: That’s what I told my
                            Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>I was in a position, from what you and Ivor told me, to tell him the
                            outline of the plan.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Did he present the
                            outline of the plan I gave you?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Yes, the same plan. He
                            didn’t deviate from it. He even improved on it a bit.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: In what way?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The powers of the Resident
                            Commissioner, the powers of the National Security Council. He gave the
                            impression that once you get down to those details, there was scope for
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister didn’t react as if he, <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >John Vorster</persName>, had to give an opinion on the merits, but
                            he gave the Rhodesians’ reaction. He told Richard the Rhodesians would
                            not easily accept the fact of a British Commissioner. Also the Council
                            of Ministers was a weakening of the previous position.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn’t think it was
                            all that different. It has a blocking mechanism.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Now you need the Resident
                            Commissioner to vote with the whites to have a blocking mechanism.</p>
                        <p>[Page 3 of the original is missing.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Yes, the outline.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The second point is
                            how it evolved and how it was handled. We gave it to the British High
                            Commissioner every day.</p>
                        <p>We did permit Smith to add the two white ministers and a white chairman.
                            Because from the reaction of <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>, we thought it was negotiable and it was better
                            for him to come out with it then and not surface it later at Geneva and
                            break up the conference and have the United States accused of making
                            secret deals.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Richard, in the course of
                            the conversation, confirmed that you had sent messages to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: However we got there,
                            I think we’re now at the point where Annex C is not achievable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: My Prime Minister told him
                            straight that Geneva was badly handled. He also told him he was very
                            upset by the United States, Britain and France’s vote in the Security
                            Council on the charges brought by Lesotho.<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Was it factually
                            incorrect?</p>
                        <pb n="708" facs="0747" xml:id="pg_708"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: It was.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: The dispute lies
                            largely in the Lesotho interpretation of the border arrangements, and
                            they don’t recognize Transkei. There is no dispute really over the
                            facts, but over the interpretation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: They claim their supply
                            lines were cut. This is untrue. They can cross the border; they don’t
                            want to submit identity documents to Transkei officials. They don’t
                            recognize South West Africa either, but we have Zambians in the hospital
                            there. Nowhere in the world is it a big thing to show identity
                            documents. They want money at our expense.</p>
                        <p>My Prime Minister said, “Why couldn’t we have a fact-finding
                            mission?”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It was never brought
                            to my attention.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: He told Richard: “Any
                            black African state can say anything and you believe it and that is it
                            and you’ll even pay. If that is so, my constructive role in Southern
                            Africa is over.”</p>
                        <p>I’m afraid that sole incident really contributed very negatively to that
                            discussion. In the end, Ivor asked my Prime Minister: “If I go north and
                            get certain commitments and achieve something that achieves what Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> had in
                            mind—majority rule in two years and assurance for the whites, and that
                            the war will stop—will you listen again to me and talk again to Smith?”
                            My Prime Minister said he would seriously consider it but couldn’t
                            commit himself at this stage.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Didn’t he say
                            “bankable assurances?”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Here are the notes:

                            the war is off, would you go to Rhodesia again?’ Prime Minister: ‘I will
                            seriously consider it but can’t commit myself at this stage.’”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Ivor was going to go
                            to Maputo, then Salisbury, then Capetown. We told the British this was
                            insane because Smith would almost certainly turn him down and that would
                            make it harder for the Prime Minister—assuming your Prime Minister wants
                            to.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: My Prime Minister hasn’t
                            spoken to Smith.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Your Prime Minister is
                            handling Smith right. The time to see Smith is when everyone else has
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Mark Chona</persName> yesterday.<note

                            and cautiousness that got us into this mess, and I’m inclined to agree.
                            He says the blacks have accepted this plan as a basis for discussion at
                            Geneva, but have not accepted a document. They’ve not accepted the
                            National Security Council and the powers of the Resident
                            Commissioner.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: And the absence of a
                            Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: They accept the
                            preamble. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>He repeated yesterday that the war would stop when the Interim Government
                            is established. They justify their recognition of the Patriotic Front on
                            the ground that only that way could they assure the war would stop.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: What does this mean, this
                            recognition?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mark said they’re not
                            cutting Muzowera out of the political process.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Or out of Geneva.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: But they say he has no
                            standing for making a ceasefire because he has no troops. But <persName
                                corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName> “can participate in the
                            political process.” Probably from jail! That is sufficient assurance—for
                            him to get out of the country.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: He can participate in
                            elections—and <persName corresp="#p_SN_1">Sithole</persName>—but only
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> can negotiate a ceasefire.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: This will have no chance
                            whatsoever of ever being considered. Never ever.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: By whom?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: By Smith. With due
                            respect, it is nonsense. It means a man who has a few troops out in the
                            bush is tantamount to majority rule. This is nonsense. It’s immoral. I
                            don’t believe this country would ever stand for it. Because <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> has a few boys with guns, he’s
                            the government.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The British are
                            drafting a new plan which is a combination of Annex C and their latest
                            ideas. I’ll give you a copy informally. That plan isn’t essentially
                            different.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Right.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WFG_1">Wisner</persName>: It provides for the
                            possibility of a Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have no objection
                            to a Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: It depends on the
                            blacks being able to agree on the Prime Minister, but leaves open the
                            possibility of no Prime Minister if they can’t agree on one.</p>
                        <p>It would be hard to leave <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName>
                            out of the consultations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The British insist on
                            elections. [To <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>:] Will
                            the British give <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> the
                            paper?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: That’s the intention.
                            But they can’t locate him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The South Africans
                            can’t negotiate if they don’t know the substance.</p>
                        <p>The Africans said they couldn’t react to Richard because he didn’t
                            formally present a plan. So now Richard will hand to them, as a “study
                                <pb n="710" facs="0749" xml:id="pg_710"/>paper,” a document which is
                            substantially what we’ve discussed. I don’t know what a “study paper”
                            is.</p>
                        <p>Then presumably he’ll go to your Prime Minister and say if that paper is
                            acceptable to the blacks, will your Prime Minister support it? (We’re
                            not talking about the Patriotic Front.) That is when you have to make a
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>I’ve come reluctantly to the conclusion that the paper is the best you’re
                            likely to get.</p>
                        <p>But if the blacks accept it as a “basis of discussion,” where are we
                            then?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: But they’ve already moved
                            away from that paper.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The British haven’t
                            moved away from it; the Africans have.</p>
                        <p>What Richard is trying to sell now is the paper you’ve seen. It’s the
                            paper you saw at the end of December, with minor modifications, which
                            we’ll tell you.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: How Richard will talk them
                            out of support for Patriotic Front, I don’t know.</p>
                        <p>I’ll be frank with you, at the end of your term. I don’t see how this can
                            be accepted. I don’t see how the American people can accept this sort of
                            thing. It is patently unjust.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Don’t kid yourself.
                            The American people won’t understand it. It may be unjust.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The newspapers have been
                            against the trend.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Which?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Star.</hi></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Star</hi> . . .</p>
                        <p>Let’s distinguish two things. Let’s distinguish between the paper and
                            recognition of the Patriotic Front. Richard won’t ask you to support the
                            Patriotic Front. Is it better for you to support that paper and then
                            have the Africans reject it? Or have the onus on you? The problem at
                            Geneva is no one has talked to them to say there is a limit. I’ve sent
                            letters, which they didn’t like, but then they tried to conciliate a
                            bit.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: I have to say, in the
                            confines of this room, that I detected on the part of my Prime Minister
                            the attitude that he’s prepared to fight it out in Southern Africa. He’s
                            concluded—partly because of the Lesotho incident—that the West,
                            including you, is not prepared to stand up. There is no indication on
                            the part of the West, including you sir, that you are willing or have
                            the means to do something. And there is every indication the new
                            Administration will make it even more difficult for us economically. I
                            say this to you because of the relationship we’ve had over the last few
                            months. We will have to go it alone.</p>
                        <pb n="711" facs="0750" xml:id="pg_711"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I wouldn’t say that. I
                            think it’s premature.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: It’s not my opinion; it’s
                            my government’s.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You may come to that
                            conclusion, but it’s not the conclusion you should come to now. Let this
                            string be played out.</p>
                        <p>If Richard then submits to pressures to go beyond this paper, you may
                            conclude you can no longer be helpful. So my recommendation is to give
                            Richard one more chance.</p>
                        <p>He has not deviated from his program. He was violent with the Africans
                            for their recognition of the Patriotic Front, and has not modified his
                            program to reflect that recognition.</p>
                        <p>I think it’s a very serious matter for South Africa to reject it. You’ll
                            be subjected to massive pressures.</p>
                        <p>If you go along—if your conscience permits it—and the Africans then
                            reject it, then it’s different.</p>
                        <p>Nothing has happened since we discussed it in the last two or three
                            weeks.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: With this Lesotho thing,
                            with your term coming to an end, with the statements coming out from the
                            new Administration, we think we’ve got to do it alone.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. Ambassador, a
                            country that fought the British for four years won’t be defeated that
                            easily. I’d recommend you give it a little more of a chance before
                            deciding to fight. It’s not a decision I’d advise you to make.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Two years ago, no liberal
                            would have conceived we would agree to a policy on South-West Africa
                            that ends apartheid, scraps the Bantustan policy, gives independence and
                            a unitary state, and what we’ve done on Rhodesia. We’ve done it—but look
                            what happens—new demands. It’s over.</p>
                        <p>In Rhodesia they will turn power over to <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> straight.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: You can always reach
                            that conclusion. But I wouldn’t advise it now.</p>
                        <p>I asked for this meeting, not you, so we wouldn’t have heard this if I
                            hadn’t.</p>
                        <p>Let me sum up. I think Richard’s plan is probably the last tolerable
                            limit of what we set out to do. I think Richard’s plan, with assurances
                            that the civil service, judiciary and economy remain in place, is the
                            last tolerable evolution.</p>
                        <p>I can tell you if we had been running the negotiation, it wouldn’t have
                            reached this point. Even <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>
                            said that yesterday. He volunteered it.</p>
                        <p>So give Richard one more chance.</p>
                        <p>Now, South-West Africa.</p>

                            don’t think, when we’re changing administrations, the South African
                            government should announce it’s decided on a policy of war.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: We won’t do that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Or act that way. Let
                            them force you into it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: We feel like a sitting

                        <p>Your Prime Minister was willing to talk to Richard. It will be this plan.
                            I know he’s a just man and will decide it carefully. He’s a South
                            African patriot. I believe there is more than a 50–50 chance the
                            Africans will turn it down. But it’s better if it happens there than in
                            Capetown.</p>
                        <p>Now, South-West Africa. We finally got an answer from <persName

                        <p>[He gets up to get the letter from <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName>.]<note n="5" xml:id="d238fn5">Not

                        <p>Here, you can read it. [He gives him the letter to read.]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: May I ask, what were the
                            conditions?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: [Hands him Tab
                                A]:<note n="6" xml:id="d238fn6">Not attached.</note> You can just
                            initial them, and we’ll call a conference.</p>
                        <p>[<persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> reads it.] I told them in
                            my view you’d probably accept this, but just in case you raised some
                            points . . . [Laughter] Was I right?</p>
                        <p>First of all I said: Are they going to insist on this? He [<persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName>] said that’s what <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is going to say, but he left the
                            impression it was negotiable. He wanted us to call a conference. I said
                            we weren’t going to call a conference if we were going to have a
                            repetition of the first Geneva experience. I said I’d give this to the
                            South Africans and I’d recommend to my successors that they wait for the
                            South African reply.</p>
                        <p>My view is the seven points we agreed on I’m prepared to defend. I’ve
                            never asked you to go beyond them. Maybe some modifications. For
                            example, prisoners. I’ve never told them you would release them; I’ve
                            told them it was my impression you’d be prepared. Now they want my
                            “assurance,” instead of my “impression.”</p>
                        <p>I’d suggest you study it and let me have a point-by-point response.</p>
                        <p>Bill?</p>
                        <pb n="713" facs="0752" xml:id="pg_713"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: Only on the first
                            point. On all that gobbledygook—let them call it what they want.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: The only point I think
                            will be difficult is Point 4. They want it to be South Africa, <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, and United Nations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: On Point 1, Point 2—they
                            say “should,” “insists,” “has been and is still ready.” There are no
                            demands made. Maybe I’m reading too much into it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My impression from
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> is it’s softer than
                            before. He said these are just <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>
                            ideas. All of this.</p>
                        <p>I don’t recommend we call a conference. I recommend we keep stonewalling
                            until they give us an agenda we can live with.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: There is a contradiction
                            between Point 3 and Point 4. This doesn’t tally.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t know if you’ve
                            met <persName corresp="#p_NSD_1">Nujoma</persName>. I don’t think
                            precision of thought is the quality that brought him to his present
                            eminence. Even though he treats me with more respect than you do.
                            [Laughter]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: Could there be an informal
                            meeting of the U.S. and the four Presidents? To clarify the points.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly. You could
                            ask questions, which we could present as our own. I don’t think the
                            meeting would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>I think we’ve handled this issue well. They’re getting no publicity out
                            of it; this is softer than before.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: If we come out with this .
                            . .</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We shouldn’t go
                            public. Neither of us.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: I haven’t consulted with
                            my government. But what if there was a private meeting between you, us
                            and the frontline Presidents? To clarify the points.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be a
                            disaster. First, they wouldn’t agree to meet with you. Second, if they
                            did, it would force the frontline Presidents to take a public position
                            and it would be the most extreme <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1"
                                >SWAPO</gloss> position. And third, the new Administration should be
                            given a chance to get some experience before they take a public
                            position. If not, they’d be taking a position on the basis of their
                            previous experience.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I would add one more:
                            If the Presidents agreed to meet with you, they’d insist <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> be present.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName>: It was just a
                            question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: All right. Can I meet
                            with you alone for a minute?</p>
                        <p>My colleagues here are entering an era where this is the last Saturday

                            if we could just sit and talk a bit, there are so many questions coming
                            at us. I have been winging it too often. We need the benefit of your

                        <p>After Angola, it seemed to me that if we did not take some definite
                            action in southern Africa, events would soon get out of control. The
                            moderates upon whom the continent depends to prevent radicalism from
                            overrunning what democracy there is would be under increasing pressure
                            to adopt guerrilla means in order to achieve majority rule throughout
                            the southern portion of the continent. When we took our first trip, all
                            the Africans wanted was our support for majority rule. I then delivered
                            a major speech in Lusaka, which, I might note, did not get the unanimous
                            approval of the Republican Party, but which had a very salutory effect
                            in Africa. Most people thought we were just talking, but then we set out
                            to implement the policy we had enunciated. We arranged for a meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> in Germany. After
                            coming to an understanding of the position he felt he was in and getting
                            some feel for the room which he thought he had for maneuver, we then
                            contacted all of the (Front Line) African Presidents. Up until that
                            time, they had been operating solely in terms of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>/Smith meetings of last
                            February—that is, within the general context of majority rule. They told
                            us, “We, the African Presidents, think that Rhodesia is insoluble. We
                            don’t believe Smith will ever agree to majority rule. We strongly advise
                            you to try to get Namibia out of the way.”</p>
                        <p>We intended to get <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> behind
                            us, then go to Lusaka, then have a conference, and then independence.
                            This was the basis upon which I met <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <p>When I first met with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>, I
                            explained to him that I saw two possibilities for the unfolding of
                            events in the southern part of the continent. The first was that the
                            problems would simply be solved by force. Matters would be taken out of
                            the hands of those leaders who preferred moderate solutions, and would
                            gravitate towards the hands of the radicals. Sooner or later, foreign
                            forces would probably appear. Or, there could be negotiations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> asked me what my ideas
                            were. I said I had no solutions. I gave him <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>’s proposals on Namibia. He agreed. He said he
                            could not go to Lusaka, but would be willing to go any place in Europe.
                            He said he’d also consider <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>
                            participation.</p>
                        <pb n="716" facs="0755" xml:id="pg_716"/>
                        <p>I then went from Germany to Britain and met with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName> in the Cabinet Room. The
                            British, you should know, have a new theory on the conduct of
                            international relations. It is that once they have prepared a paper and
                            handed it over to you, they feel they still have the right to completely
                            disavow it on the grounds that it has not been cleared by the Cabinet.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1">Callaghan</persName> prepared a paper
                            which he handed over to me in the presence of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName> and several others of their
                            senior people. The two papers that they prepared were, first, one
                            setting forth the constitutional arrangements for the evolution of power
                            in Rhodesia, and second, the economic arrangements. I then sent
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> back to Africa. He
                            was generally well received. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> quite frankly didn’t think that Rhodesia would
                            work out, but he agreed to give it a try. There were three annexes, A,
                            B, and C—the first two of which were relatively inconsequential. The
                            first related to protection for minorities; Annex B were some proposals
                            for the composition of Parliament and voting qualifications. Isn’t that
                            right, Phil?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: Yes, I think so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Anyway, Annexes A and B were relatively inconsequential.
                            Annex C was what I proposed in Pretoria. You have Annex C I believe,
                            don’t you.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName> nods
                            affirmatively.)</p>
                        <p>The British then sent a team here to Washington, where we tried to polish
                            up a few of the details. We then sent two of our people to London to try
                            to make the thing more acceptable. Then <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName> and Duff went off with Annex C to Africa. The
                            basic proposal was for a Council of State, a Council of Ministers, and
                            two years to independence. Bill (to <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName>), is it correct to say that all of the
                            essential elements were presented to the presidents.</p>
                        <p>(<persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName> nods assent.)</p>
                        <p>We gathered that Annex C would be generally acceptable to the South
                            Africans and to the Presidents. <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1"
                                >Schaufele</persName> and Duff returned to London. I then arranged a
                            meeting with the South Africans in Zurich. On the way to Zurich I
                            stopped in London. <persName corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName>
                            handed me a revised Annex C which, that evening, I handed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>. You have that Annex C in your
                            files.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> accepted this version of
                            Annex C. He undertook to sell it to Smith and said that he would
                            threaten to cut off aid to Rhodesia if they didn’t accept it. He said he
                            would see to it that Smith would not wiggle out of it. The British had
                            said in that draft that the Council of State would have a majority of
                            whites. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> said he didn’t
                            think the blacks would accept that, so <persName corresp="#p_CJ_1"
                                >Callaghan</persName> changed it that night to a black majority.
                            This was done in a hasty exchange of cables with London. We then said we
                            doubted that Rhodesia would accept a black majority on the Council of
                            State. We agreed to leave things slightly indefinite. It <pb n="717"
                                facs="0756" xml:id="pg_717"/>was against this background, then, that
                            we went to Africa. First we met with <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                            >Nyerere</persName>’s attitude was very clear. He said, “If you think
                            you can perform miracles, go ahead. But I can tell you now it won’t
                            work. Smith won’t accept it.” <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName> had no major objections to Annex C. They all
                            preferred a Governor General, but no one objected to a Council of
                            State.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>, I should tell you,
                            pulled one of his more outrageous stunts on this trip by pretending to
                            be one of the soul brothers of the African tribes. (laughter)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> raised a number of
                            practical problems, which were relatively inconsequential. He suggested
                            that the timetable for independence be shortened. He also suggested that
                            the Council of State have a British chairman. These were minor
                            problems—nothing of any particular consequence. Regarding Namibia,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> was absolutely
                            delighted. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> had accepted
                            precisely what he wanted; all the Africans wanted was a United Nations
                            role and some South African participation.</p>
                        <p>We then went off to South Africa, and I must say we had a bit of a rough
                            time with <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>, persuading
                            him to accept the revised proposals. But the most painful negotiations I
                            have spent in my eight years in Washington were the seven hours with
                            Smith. It was really painful. I don’t think I will ever be able to
                            describe exactly how painful it was. For him and his colleagues, there
                            was no question that this represented the end. We were asking them to
                            accept the destruction of everything that they and their fathers had
                            built. They were being asked to sign their own suicide pacts. It may
                            well be that they are actors [omission in the original] were there
                            thought that they were acting. Smith saw major problems in selling this
                            to his people. He thought that perhaps if the chairman of the Council of
                            State could be white and if the Defense and Law and Order ministers were
                            white, he would have a slightly better chance. I said I would undertake
                            to try to sell it to <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I then went back to <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and
                            said that the proposal was for a Council of State of five ministers with
                            a white chairman and two white ministers. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> was absolutely ecstatic. He said, “My God,
                            you’ve performed a miracle. There is no need to go through all the
                            details; we’ll work them all out at the conference.” Both he and I held
                            a press conference that same afternoon, and he said essentially the same
                            thing. After <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>, I saw
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and I told him that I
                            wasn’t really very confident. I sent a message to Smith that evening
                            through the South Africans, telling him what I had learned about
                                <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName>’s and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>’s thoughts on the Council of
                            State. After the two meetings with <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KK_1"
                                >Kaunda</persName>, we (referring to those who were on the trip) met
                            to discuss what had taken place. We decided to pass a message to Smith
                            to go ahead and put in the proposal for a Council of State of five with
                            a <pb n="718" facs="0757" xml:id="pg_718"/>white chairman and two white
                            ministers. Our thought was that if that were the opening negotiating
                            position, we could then fall back to a black Council of State.</p>
                        <p>I then returned to Washington through London, and then a strange thing
                            happened. The British totally disavowed their own paper. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CA_1">Crosland</persName> told me it had not been
                            submitted to the Cabinet and therefore it had no standing. Now I must
                            tell you, Cy, that in my own discussions I never asked an ambassador
                            whether his papers were cleared within his own government. I simply
                            assume it. Anyway, there in the Cabinet room they disavowed their own
                            paper. Frankly, I must tell you, Cy, I will believe to my dying day that
                            if Smith had gone off to the conference and had proposed the essence of
                            Annex C with a Council of State with five ministers, a white chairman,
                            and whites in the Law and Order and Defense ministries, and independence
                            in two years, that the blacks would have accepted it on the spot.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Mark Chona</persName> as much as told us
                            so here in Washington last week.</p>
                        <p>But what happened next was that the British wasted an incredible three
                            weeks in Geneva on the most trivial of issues—in fact, one which was not
                            an issue when Geneva began—the timing of independence. No African had
                            ever objected to two years. Then we saw further internal haggling among
                            the Rhodesians which made the Patriotic Front look positively organized.
                            But it was <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor Richard</persName>’s show.
                            When Richard collapsed on the independence issue, which was the <hi
                                rend="italic">one</hi> non-controversial point, everyone having
                            agreed on two years, that simply made everyone think that he’d collapse
                            on anything. And it came apart from there.</p>
                        <p>On Namibia you’ve seen the seven-point proposal. We have letters from
                            both <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> saying that it’s okay. We never
                            surfaced the seven points, however, because we didn’t want two
                            conferences going at the same time. But the second reason was that if we
                            ever put out the seven points, then you’d simply end up in the same sort
                            of situation that we’ve had over Rhodesia. There would be a Front-Line
                            Presidents’ meeting and they would have to reject it. It is a proposal
                            on which everyone agrees. But the minute it is surfaced, each side will
                            take it as the maximum demand from the other side, and they would have
                            to reject it or haggle endlessly over it.</p>
                        <p>But frankly, I’ve never accepted that Namibia was a difficult problem.
                            The South Africans want rid of it. <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> won’t talk directly to <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>, but beyond that, there are no
                            real substantive problems.</p>
                        <p>Frankly, Richard’s odyssey through Africa baffles me. He has absolutely
                            no one lined up on anything. He is selling bits and pieces of paper to
                            people, but nothing concrete, and nothing that everyone can agree on.
                            Your problem is going to be to try to reestablish coherency. You have
                            some things going for you. No one wants war to start up <pb n="719"
                                facs="0758" xml:id="pg_719"/>again. The Front Line Presidents are
                            united in their desire for a negotiated solution. On Namibia, I think
                                <persName corresp="#p_NSD_1">Nujoma</persName> will probably come
                            around. What I would recommend would be to organize another conference
                            and find a solution to this problem. Once you have a solution to this
                            problem, the implication will be that you can resolve the other
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: I talked to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> and the Tanzanian ambassador
                            earlier this week. They were eager of course for some word about what
                            our policies would be. I told them first that the policy was under
                            review. Second, that we placed the highest priority on a negotiated
                            settlement. Third, that we strongly support the British effort to find a
                            solution to the problems, and fourth, that we will maintain the closest
                            possible contact with the Presidents (of the Front-Line states).
                            Regarding Namibia I told them we would maintain our role as an
                            interested observer. Secondly, that we attach highest priority to a
                            peaceful settlement. And third, that we would be in touch with <persName
                                corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> as soon as we finished our
                            policy review. My own feeling, very strongly, Andy, is that we should
                            say nothing more until the review is finished. I don’t think anything
                            could possibly be worse than to give the impression of lack of
                            confidence in the British efforts or of some change in our own policy. I
                            talked to <persName corresp="#p_RSP_1">Peter Ramsbotham</persName> at
                            lunch and he said that they had just put Richard’s proposals into
                            writing. He (Richard) is going to try to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> on board. Regarding Namibia,
                            the Tanzanian ambassador said <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2"
                                >Nyerere</persName> still thinks it’s the easier of the two problems
                            to resolve.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Me, too. The
                            fact that the South Africans said they’d send someone to the conference
                            gives <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> a fig leaf, which
                            is important since <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> said
                            he would never meet with <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>. And
                                <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> says the Windhoek people
                            have to be part of the South African delegation, which is also probably
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> said that today. I asked him
                            whether it was realistic. He said yes, he thought it was.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I’d
                            firm up the seven points. They’re so close together now, there should be
                            no problem at all. The basic essentials are independence by 1978; the
                            points introduce <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> into the
                            conference; since <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> is recognized
                            by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, there should be no further
                            problem there; it gets the South Africans into the conference; and it
                            binds the South Africans to the results of the conference. If we can
                            bridge these relatively small differences, the South Africans tell us
                            that there should be no further problem from their standpoint. All we’re
                            talking about are minor semantic differences. I’ve told the Africans I
                            think the South Africans will release the prisoners that <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> wants.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Yes, <gloss
                                target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> wants some of those people on
                            their delegation, don’t they?</p>
                        <pb n="720" facs="0759" xml:id="pg_720"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. There
                            is one, of course, the South Africans say they’ll never release. But
                            what you have to do is define the frame of reference adequately.</p>
                        <p>I have to tell you I think the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> has
                            mishandled the whole thing. By giving up right away to the Africans in
                            their insistence on raising the timeframe for independence—which was a
                            non-contentious point—they wasted time and they created the impression
                            that nothing was sacrosanct. Now no one is prepared to believe that the
                            British will hold to anything. The British position is too close to that
                            of the Patriotic Front. In every decision that they have had to make,
                            they have come down on the side of the blacks. That could hardly have
                            been calculated to inspire confidence in either <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> or Smith that the British can
                            be counted upon to be fair and objective.</p>
                        <p>Richard is now running around like a travelling salesman. As I see it,
                            you have two options. You can either get the whites to agree to your
                            proposals and then go to the blacks and say “the whites have agreed to
                            this—will you sign?” Or you can get the Africans to agree to a set of
                            proposals, and then you go to the whites to say “here is what the blacks
                            agree to—is this acceptable?” What <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>’s nightmare is, is that he will agree to a set
                            of proposals and then the Africans will reject it. Is that a fair
                            description, Jack (to <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1"
                            >Reinhardt</persName>)?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: Yes, it is.
                            I personally just don’t think it (referring to the Geneva conference)
                            will work. There is now too little confidence on both sides.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree.
                            (Turning to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>) But please
                            tell <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> that whatever he
                            would like me to do, I will agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: The one thing I don’t
                            want to do is pull the rug out from under Richard. I don’t think we can
                            do anything else (except support him).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, and the
                            most important thing is, you can’t let it be said that Richard’s effort
                            failed because you did not give him support.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Should we say anything
                            to Smith?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I never said
                            anything to him. My tactic was to be active all around him to increase
                            his nervousness, to get everyone else signed up, and then to tell him
                            what I wanted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: I saw in the paper that
                            he said the incoming Administration didn’t support the United Kingdom
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We never
                            told him what we would do or what we would not. We told him we didn’t
                            think he would be pushed beyond Annex C, and I think if you tell him now
                            that you’re fully behind Richard’s proposals, you’ll get an explosion.
                            Why not just wait to see what Richard gets. Why should the new
                            Administration rush to get it<pb n="721" facs="0760" xml:id="pg_721"
                            />self into a bind. I think it’s a waste of time to talk to Smith right
                            now. Get <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>’s agreement to
                            a set of proposals, then get the Africans behind it. Then tell Smith
                            what you’ve got. If you go to Smith now, he can only reject it. He will
                            claim—I can see <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> what he will say. I can
                            give you a perfect script. If you go to Smith now, he will be forced to
                            reject it. He will claim betrayal. He will quote you Annex C and he’s
                            absolutely right.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: Smith has some
                            sort of private communications channel through Andrews of Allegheny
                            Ludlum Steel, doesn’t he?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: He’s been in.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, I
                            personally believe there is no sense in talking to Smith now until you
                            have a concrete program which you want him to agree to—to which you want
                            a yes or no. If you go in now, <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> will simply say in Pretoria that he will study
                            it and he will study it to death. In my view, Richard should say to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>, look, I’m not
                            asking you to approve this. This is what I’m thinking of. If I get black
                            approval, will you accept it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: I think I understand.
                            He should give the proposals to all of them and then he goes home.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It is
                            mathematically certain that Smith will reject it if Richard goes to
                            Salisbury now. He has no other choice. My advice is to stay out of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(Universal agreement)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Okay. First we’ll go to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> through <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> and say that we understand that
                            these are the proposals and we’re studying them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Richard can
                            say to Smith, “I don’t have a consensus yet.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: We could say this
                            through <persName corresp="#p_RSP_1">Peter (Ramsbotham)</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Especially
                            since he hasn’t seen <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> yet.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: If he’s
                            insistent on going to Salisbury, we could of course ask the South
                            Africans to advise Smith not to say anything, publicly at least.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Basically, I
                            fundamentally do not believe in diplomatic trips where you believe
                            failure is certain. After I got <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> signed up, I gave him two weeks to work on
                            Smith. I said I wouldn’t agree to meet with Smith unless <persName
                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> could guarantee that Smith
                            would agree. Even if <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            agreed to Richard’s proposals tomorrow, he’s still got to work on Smith.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> isn’t going to agree
                            to Richard’s proposals right away. What kind of position does that leave
                            him in vis-à-vis Smith?</p>

                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: One thing that
                            could be pointed out to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            is that there has been some progress in putting together a coherent
                            black leadership group. Up until this time, it seemed as though the
                            Front Line nations had no control over the nationalists and there was no
                            unified leadership. As of the most recent Lusaka conference,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d239fn4">The Front Line Presidents, meeting in Lusaka
                                January 8–9, issued a communiqué supporting the Patriotic Front

                            Patriotic Front, and the Patriotic Front appears to be in control of the
                            military situation. They simply couldn’t back <persName

                                corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> would be agreeing to someone
                            who had some military control. As I understand it, they’re not committed
                            to the Patriotic Front as the ultimate government, but only to the Front
                            as a negotiating instrument. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Muzorewa</persName> can always, of course, participate or even
                            recover power through elections. But at last there is some organization
                            in the black ranks. This is the first time this has been the case in 15
                            years, so if <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> wants some
                            element of control, this may well be better.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName>?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: He’s out of
                            control. He’s absolutely untrustworthy. Even though <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> has some authority over
                            guerrillas outside Rhodesia, <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                                >Mugabe</persName> has no power inside Rhodesia. That, at least, is
                            the perception of the South Africans, and probably of Smith.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: It
                            certainly is.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If I could
                            have picked someone from the beginning, it would have been <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MA_2"
                                >Muzorewa</persName> has been all over the map. First he was on the
                            side of the guerrillas, now he’s on the side of the peacemakers. He’s
                            certainly no great hero. <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> is
                            the best. What I don’t understand is, is he just a figurehead for
                                <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> or does he have power
                            of his own?</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> at least seems to feel that once
                            agreement is reached, the guerrillas can be dealt with by sending one
                            battalion to Tanzania, one to Zambia, and so on and so you can get rid
                            of them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Look, if
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> can deliver and you can
                            hold elections without a guerrilla threat, that’s the ideal script. But
                            the trouble is, as soon as you get the Africans to agree, then they
                            raise the ante.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: I believe
                                <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and even <persName
                                corresp="#p_MS_2">Machel</persName> believe they can keep the
                            Patriotic Front supported and under control.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My own
                            judgment is that if you could go to <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> and say here is a concrete plan; I have the
                            black Presidents and the Patriotic Front agreed to it. The civil service
                            will stay in place; <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> will
                            agree. But if you give him nothing, he’ll simply recite a long series of
                            betrayals, dig himself in and you’ll get nothing.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: The Nigerian
                            role was interesting. Garba says he’s never heard of Mugabe; that Mugabe
                            is a plant.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (laughing)
                            Is he our plant? (Turning to <persName corresp="#p_VC_1"
                                >Vance</persName>) I never did get <gloss target="#t_AF_1"
                                >AF</gloss> under control.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_MR_2">Mugabe</persName> may be a bit more responsive to
                            control by <persName corresp="#p_NJ_2">Nyerere</persName> and not so
                            much by <persName corresp="#p_KK_1">Kaunda</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: It’s a bit
                            like dealing with the Harvard faculty. (laughter)</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RJE_1">Reinhardt</persName>: He
                            certainly has no following inside the country.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: My own feeling
                            is that <persName corresp="#p_MA_2">Muzorewa</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NJ_1">Nkomo</persName> basically had no following with
                            the guerrillas and no feeling for what they wanted.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: If someone
                            could plausibly tell <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName>
                            that the Patriotic Front is only an instrument for arranging for a
                            ceasefire and an interim government and will then be disbanded, my guess
                            is that <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> would probably
                            go for it. I think there’s about a 60–40 chance. But if this is simply
                            put in some sort of vague form, <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> is not going to agree.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> has a plan to disperse the
                            mercenaries.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Brzezinski: The white mercenaries?</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: Yes. I don’t
                            know precisely how it will work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Well, as I see it, we
                            have a couple of things to do. First, I’ll talk to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> and tell him what we’ve agreed
                            to. Then I’ll ask <persName corresp="#p_RSP_1">Peter
                                Ramsbotham</persName> whether they really want to go forward.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: I would think
                            the British must be getting awfully tired of this by now.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, and you
                            watch. They’ll try to stick us with failure. Frankly, I think Richard
                            should go home after he sees <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: My own fear
                            is that the British will say look, we’ve got the nationalists on board,
                            now you produce South Africa. The British, you know, haven’t always kept
                            us very well informed about what they’re up to. We don’t have any real
                            idea what they’re telling the nationalists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Well, in my
                            own view, the convincing argument why Richard should not go to Salisbury
                            now, or even in the fore<pb n="724" facs="0763" xml:id="pg_724"/>seeable
                            future, is if you’re going to depend on <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> to bring pressure on Smith, it’s going to be
                            harder if Smith is already on record as having rejected your
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: Publicly.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>:
                            Publicly.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: I just can’t
                            see <persName corresp="#p_RI_1">Ivor Richard</persName> with enough
                            energy to push anything through right now. He should go home and
                            rest.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: My strong
                            advice is I didn’t have enough fire power in the remaining days of this
                            Administration to compel either the nationalists or the Rhodesians to be
                            sensible. But I think a halt has to be called to the nonsense. You put
                            together a package that the blacks can agree on, you then can go to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1">Vorster</persName> and say this is what
                            we have gotten them to agree to. The white judiciary and civil service
                            and defense will stay in place for the interim government. You tell the
                            Patriotic Front if the whites don’t get this, they don’t agree.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM_2">Chona</persName> recommended that they
                            agree. I have no reason to believe that they would not agree.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: Is there any
                            financial responsibility, Mr. Secretary, that we might have to take to
                            Congress?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, there is
                            none apart from the Zimbabwe development fund, which you know about. We
                            have commitments from a number of countries.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: Are we talking
                            about very much—perhaps a billion dollars?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: No, we’re
                            only talking about three or four hundred million and that over a period
                            of five years.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: Would this be
                            administered only by ourselves or could it go through an international
                            institution such as the World Bank?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: The World
                            Bank is interested in it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: We have no
                            fixed ideas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: What’s the best way out
                            of this?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: I should
                            stay out of it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: I’ll talk
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RSP_1">Peter Ramsbotham</persName>. Shall I refer to
                            this meeting?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, but
                            just make sure that it’s understood that it comes from Cy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Yes, that’s fine.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: We can say
                            there’s been a meeting of the two Administrations and a review of the
                            policies to see where we are now. We can say we’re encouraged by the
                            progress shown so far.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: I think they are
                            simply waiting it out.</p>
                        <pb n="725" facs="0764" xml:id="pg_725"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Yes, but if they know
                            we’re both behind it, it would be an encouraging sign.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: The South
                            Africans, you know, are being very “iffy” about this. The latest note is
                            very negative.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. I’m
                            surprised and frankly, I gave <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1"
                                >Botha</persName> hell the other day.<note n="5" xml:id="d239fn5"
                                >See <ref target="#d238">Document 238</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: He was
                            quite negative on Namibia too. Maybe they’re just posturing. I think the
                            South Africans are just afraid the new Administration is going to be
                            very hard on them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Phil?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: Part of the message to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRF_1">Botha</persName> might well be that
                            Richard is going to fail and that they, the South Africans, should not
                            drop the effort to find a negotiated solution just because Richard
                            fails.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Now wait a
                            minute. The message should be that the new Administration is behind the
                            British effort and will do everything possible to help it succeed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Yes. We want them to
                            know that we will continue to be supportive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: And the second part
                            would be not to leave the impression that Richard should go to
                            Salisbury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: Oh, no. This is their
                            decision that they have to make. We’ll simply say that we believe that
                            with good will and serious intent both sides can find a reasonable
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: (laughs at
                            the reference) You know, did I ever tell you the great one that Le Duc
                            Tho played on me? He came up to me at the end of one of the Vietnam
                            meetings and looked me in the eye and said, “You know, I want to talk to
                            you with good will and serious intent—frankly, sincerely,
                            open-heartedly—you’re a liar.” (great laughter)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>: What should we say to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSP_1">Ramsbotham</persName>?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: Tell him
                            exactly what you told the South Africans so they (the British) can’t
                            stick you with not having kept them fully informed. Secondly, you can
                            say that we seriously question whether Richard should go to Salisbury
                            because if he does go to Salisbury, Smith will simply reject it and it
                            will complicate the burden <persName corresp="#p_VBJ_1"
                                >Vorster</persName> will have of trying to sell Smith.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: There is an
                            additional problem. If <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andy
                                Young</persName> goes to Zanzibar, he’s going to get stuck with all
                            sorts of questions.</p>
                        <pb n="726" facs="0765" xml:id="pg_726"/>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName>: I think I
                            should simply say that I’ve been sworn in less than a week. I’m there to
                            listen. I’m not there to make policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC_1">Vance</persName>: That’s absolutely
                            right, Andy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>: What’s going
                            on in Zanzibar?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWE_1">Schaufele</persName>: It’s the
                            tenth anniversary of the Declaration of Arusha.</p>
