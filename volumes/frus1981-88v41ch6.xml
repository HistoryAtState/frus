                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                        <p>In 1972, the United States participated in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Conference on the Human Environment, which took place in
                            Stockholm, Sweden, June 5–16. During the Conference, the U.S. delegation
                            pressed for “support for a 10-year whaling moratorium,” which began the
                            U.S. effort to pursue an international ban on commercial whaling. (<ref

                        <p>During the Ford administration, U.S. officials continued to try to
                            restrict whaling at meetings of the International Whaling Commission
                                (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>). In 1975, U.S. efforts led to
                            a reduction of whale-catch limits that represented “a partial
                            fulfillment of the U.S. proposal for a 10 year moratorium on all
                            commercial whaling which was adopted at the U.N. Conference on the Human
                            Environment in Stockholm in 1972.” (Telegram 9980 from London, June 27,

                        <p>Carter officials also pursued a commercial whaling ban. In 1980, a U.S.
                            effort to implement an immediate and outright ban on commercial whaling
                            failed by a vote of 14 in favor, 9 against, with 1 abstention (passage
                            required three-fourths majority). (Telegram 15898 from London, July 26,

                            Great Britain proposed “an indefinite moratorium on all commercial
                            whaling” at the July 20–25 <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting
                            in Great Britain. The proposal was defeated narrowly by a vote of 16 in
                            favor, 8 against, with 3 abstentions. (Telegram 13830 from London, July

                        <p>A second proposal to ban commercial whaling was introduced at the 1982
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting. This proposal, which
                            called for a commercial whaling moratorium after 1985 and an assessment
                            of the moratorium in 1990, succeeded by a vote of 25 in favor, 7
                            against, with 5 abstentions. Thereafter U.S. policy shifted to enforcing
                            the moratorium and negotiating with states that wished to continue
                            whaling. (Telegram 16122 from London, July 26, 1982; Department of

                            <p>I know you are aware of the impasse we seem to have reached on the
                                issue of whaling with the Japanese and the significant problems that
                                certifying the Japanese will cause us in trade and other fields of
                                foreign affairs.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, I am also aware of the conservationist pressure
                                and White House interest that exists for a better managed whale
                                stock. I would hope that our government could be sensitive to these
                                pressures and still not decide to certify any country without due
                                regard to the trade and foreign policy questions involved.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, I would suggest that the Departments of State and
                                Commerce, in the context of our present position or some modified
                                position, explore the possibility for equitable compromise.<note

                            perhaps it can be discussed in the Prime Minister’s subsequent meetings

                            they maintain their objections to the moratorium and engage in actual
                            whaling activities contrary to the moratorium after it takes effect.
                            Although we have an indication from the Japanese that they are
                            interested in avoiding fisheries sanctions and from the Norwegians that
                            they want to avoid a bilateral confrontation, we have no indication that
                            a complete termination of whaling activities would be acceptable. All
                            the other whaling countries, except the U.S.S.R., have now indicated a
                            willingness to abide by the moratorium decision, to differing degrees in
                            response to U.S. pressure. In addition, within the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, the countries supporting the
                            moratorium look to the U.S. as the only enforcer of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> action (through the sanctions
                            available in the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> and

                        <p>In these circumstances there is a significant prospect of confrontation
                            between the U.S. and Norway and the U.S. and Japan, respectively, when
                            the moratorium enters into effect. Confrontation over this issue with
                            Japan and/or Norway could have a significant negative impact upon our
                            respective bilateral relationships. Recognition of the consequences of
                            confrontation over whaling issues has led to the consultations between
                            the U.S. and Norway, and the U.S. and Japan, to explore some form of
                            compromise. The consultations have concentrated upon the possibility of
                            developing a formula to permit continuation of limited whaling of a
                            subsistence character which could be construed as not being subject to
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s ban on commercial
                            whaling.</p>

                            export of whale products. Although Japan has also insisted that some
                            pelagic whaling remain, to be justified as a research project without
                            import restrictions (allowing Soviet whaling to continue), they have
                            shown some flexibility already on numbers of whales taken in these

                        <p>It appears that requiring a phase-out in order for a compromise to be
                            acceptable to the U.S. is not likely to give us the opportunity to
                            discover if Japan and/or Norway will accept a major reduction in the
                            level of their whaling and other controls, and is very likely to end the
                            discussions. The Japanese and Norwegians have told us they cannot accept
                            a phase-out provision. The moratorium was also called a phase-out and
                            was rejected by the public and the Governments of both countries.</p>
                        <p>A more constructive approach might be to guide the discussions toward a
                            major reduction in the level of coastal whaling and toward a structure
                            which the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> can oversee. This
                            approach would have many of the advantages of a phase-out: disincentives
                            and restrictions to limit applicability to other whaling countries and
                            easier differentiation from the Commercial Whaling Moratorium decision
                            yet would be easier for Japan and Norway to sell at home. This should
                            not include a continuation of pelagic or research whaling because this
                            does not offer <pb facs="0905" n="859" xml:id="pg_859"/> any of these
                            benefits, unless it’s acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>. Such a position would offer us the time that we all
                            agree is on our side and substantially reduced whaling which will result
                            in the eventual acceptance of the end to whaling in these countries.</p>
                        <p>At this time it would not be helpful for the U.S. to take the initiative
                            within the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, but our position should
                            allow us to keep our options open. Informal discussions with other
                            Commissioners concerning possible structure of a proposal would be
                            useful. There is no assurance that the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> would accept any compromise but certainly U.S. support
                            would be critical. On the other hand the impression that the U.S. and
                            Japan and Norway respectively have cut a deal without <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> involvement could easily result in a
                            backlash. In order to take into account U.S. foreign policy concerns and
                            the U.S. commitment to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> as well
                            as the implementation of the commercial whaling moratorium decision, the
                            State Department should advocate this approach in our discussions with
                            the Department of Commerce.<note n="7" xml:id="d304fn7">Not further

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> indicated that under the
                            “life-estate” concept that they are studying, there would in the future
                            be no building of new whaling vessels and no increase in the number or

                            be a revival of commercial whaling as a result of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s Comprehensive Assessment by 1990
                            (part of the moratorium decision), the life estate concept would be
                            discontinued. The Japanese also stressed that if Japan was certified
                            during negotiations it would be totally impossible for Japan to make the
                            necessary concessions to accept such a concept. As you know, we are in
                            the process of agreeing on the text of a letter to send to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> conveying our
                            positive reaction to this movement by the Japanese and requesting that
                            certification be avoided in order to accomplish a negotiated compromise
                            to avoid the immediate problem.<note n="6" xml:id="d305fn6">See <ref
                                    target="#d306">Document 306</ref>.</note> There appears to be
                            agreement in the State Department that we would be unable to reach a
                            compromise on the sperm whale problem if certification were to occur
                            during our negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Although we are all encouraged by the Japanese interest in the “life
                            estate” (phase-out) concept to be discussed next week as a possible
                            compromise to avoid the sperm whale problem, we will be discussing what
                            items to consider in the negotiations. We will probably also want <pb
                                facs="0907" n="861" xml:id="pg_861"/> to discuss what response we
                            will give concerning the Japanese request that no certification be made
                            while we are negotiating. We understand that Dr. Byrne has told Japanese
                            Government officials that the certification process would begin as soon
                            as one whale was taken but that there would be no certification before
                            the discussions next week. When asked how soon certification could take
                            place once the taking of a sperm whale was verified, he reportedly said
                            within a few days.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we will be able to assess the Japanese approach only after it
                            is presented to us next week, but at this joint meeting we will want to
                            discuss what the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> specific proposal
                            might involve and which items we should consider for the negotiations.
                            Some items which might be brought up at this joint meeting are:</p>
                        <p>What is the basis for providing the guarantees requested by the <gloss

                        <p>I am writing to suggest steps that might be taken to advance the
                            President’s objective of ending commercial whaling.</p>
                        <p>The International Whaling Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>) has established what amounts to a <hi rend="italic">de

                            continue sperm whaling under its objection, as it is entitled to do
                            under <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> rules.<note n="3"

                        <p>The Japanese Government strongly believes that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> decision is unsound, was taken
                            improperly, and is unfair to Japan. Nevertheless, senior officials have
                            told us that they recognize that the end of Japanese whaling is
                            inevitable. They stress, however, that whaling is a major emotional
                            issue in Japan. There is a serious risk that this issue could so inflame
                            public opinion in Japan as to erode our efforts to assure compliance
                            with the conservation program of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>, regardless of the penalties we would impose under the

                                <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendments.</p>
                        <p>Dr. John Byrne, Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                            Administration, who is the U.S. Commissioner to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, has proposed a way to resolve this
                            issue that I believe would advance our objective of strengthening the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, take into consideration the
                            sensitivity of the whaling issue to many in the Congress and in the
                            environmental movement, and provide the Japanese a way for dealing with
                            their domestic political problem. This is the so-called “life estate”
                            approach, under which whaling would be phased out as current Japanese
                            sperm whalers retire. Since the number of Japanese sperm whalers is
                            small and their average age high, this would end Japanese sperm whaling
                            in the not too distant future. Representatives from Japan will be
                            meeting next week in Washington with representatives of our Departments
                            to discuss this approach.<note n="4" xml:id="d306fn4">See <ref

                        <p>There is no question that the threat of certification of Japan under the
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName>-Magnuson Amendment
                            provides an incentive for the Japanese Government to work with us to
                            resolve this issue. At the same time, Japanese officials have stressed
                            that certification itself would inflame the issue and eliminate the
                            Government’s ability to fashion a compromise acceptable to public
                            opinion in Japan. It would appear that we can achieve maximum leverage
                            if we begin the certification process as soon as the Japanese begin
                            sperm whaling, but delay making a final decision on certification so
                            long as we are making satisfactory progress in negotiations with Japan.
                            After the meeting next week, we can assess the acceptability of the
                            Japanese program.</p>
                        <p>In my view this would be the best way to achieve a compromise that would
                            enhance the effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            and the likelihood of achieving our goal of eliminating whaling.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate very much indeed the cooperative relationship that has
                            developed between our Departments on the whaling issue and the
                            leadership that has been displayed by Dr. Byrne. You can count on our
                            continued constructive support.<note n="5" xml:id="d306fn5">In his

                        </opener>
                        <p>I am writing to you concerning the recent meetings<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d307fn2">See the attachment below.</note> between the
                            representatives of the Government of Japan and the Government of the
                            United States on the subject of commercial sperm whaling in the western
                            division stock of the North Pacific.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the Government of Japan is keenly aware that the whaling
                            issue poses a threat of friction between our two countries. The
                            Government of Japan wishes to resolve this issue as quickly and amicably
                            as possible to avoid a confrontation which might be caused by the
                            application of United States domestic statutes, namely Section 8(a) of
                            the Fishermen’s Protective Act (the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment) and Section 201(e) (2) of the Magnuson
                            Fishery Conservation and Management Act (the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName>-Magnuson Amendment).<note

                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, while both Governments are Parties to the International
                            Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (the Convention) and while we
                            both share the concern for the general objectives of the Convention,
                            there are certain differences between our two countries which arise from
                            our different cultural and domestic situations.</p>
                        <p>As you know, <ref target="#d30fn1">footnote 1</ref> added in 1981 to
                            Table 3 of the Schedule to the Convention prohibits the commercial
                            harvest of sperm whales from the western division stock of the North
                            Pacific unless the International Whaling Commission affirmatively
                            decides otherwise. The Government of Japan has lodged an objection to
                                <ref target="#d30fn1">footnote 1</ref>, in accordance with the
                            provision of paragraph 3 of Article V of the Convention, and is

                        </p>
                        <p>The Government of Japan, recognizing the need to take measures including
                            the withdrawal of the objection mentioned above in order to avoid a
                            confrontation between our two countries, seeks an additional period of
                            time for the purpose of minimizing the economic and social hardship of
                            those who are engaged in commercial sperm whaling. The <pb facs="0911"
                                n="865" xml:id="pg_865"/> Government of Japan endeavors to take
                            appropriate measures in order to meet this purpose.</p>
                        <p>I therefore request that, as long as Japanese commercial whaling is
                            conducted in a manner as indicated in the arrangement set forth in the
                            Summary of Discussions attached to this letter, you not consider that
                            the whaling will diminish the effectiveness of the Convention or its
                            conservation program and not certify such whaling as provided for in the

                            <p>Mr. Hiroya Sano, Director-General, Fisheries Agency, Ministry of
                                Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Government of Japan</p>
                            <p>The latest in a series of bilateral discussions between Japan and the
                                United States were conducted in Washington, D.C., November 1–12,
                                1984, in an effort to determine whether it would be possible, in
                                accordance with the laws and regulations in effect in each country,
                                to develop an arrangement whereby the United States Secretary of
                                Commerce might refrain from “certifying” sperm whaling by Japanese
                                nationals, if they take sperm whales under the objection of the
                                Government of Japan to <ref target="#d307fn1">footnote 1</ref> to
                                Table 3 of the Schedule to the International Convention for the
                                Regulation of Whaling, 1946 (the Convention). The heads of the
                                delegations shared the view that such an arrangement might be
                                possible, subject to satisfactory resolution of certain details and
                                to approval and implementation by the cognizant authorities of each
                                Government. The essential points of such a possible arrangement
                                would be the following:</p>
                            <p>1. (A) The Government of Japan may permit a catch of 400 sperm whales
                                during each of the 1984 and 1985 coastal seasons, subject to the <pb

                            <p>(B) If, by December 13, 1984, the Government of Japan withdraws its
                                objection, lodged November 9, 1981 under paragraph 3 of Article V of

                                diminish the effectiveness of the Convention or its conservation
                                program, and would therefore not certify such sperm whaling as
                                provided for in Section 8(a) of the Fishermen’s Protective Act (the

                                not consider that whaling specified below would diminish the
                                effectiveness of the Convention or its conservation program and

                                >Murazumi</persName>:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter about the recent bilateral consultations
                            between representatives of our governments on the Japanese harvest of
                            sperm whales from the western division stock of the North Pacific and
                            the possibility that I, as Secretary of Commerce, may certify any
                            confirmed harvest of sperm whales by Japanese nationals.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d308fn2">Document 307.</note></p>
                        <p>After consulting with the United States Commissioner to the International
                            Whaling Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>), I have
                            concluded that commercial harvests of whales by Japanese nationals
                            within the limits and under the circumstances set forth in the Summary
                            of Discussions attached to your letter would not diminish the
                            effectiveness of the International Convention for the Regulation of
                            Whaling, 1946, or its conservation program.</p>
                        <p>The reports of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s Scientific
                            Committee, as well as the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s 1982
                            decision to permit quotas of 450 and 400 whales for the 1982 and 1983
                            coastal sperm whaling seasons, respectively,<note n="3" xml:id="d308fn3"
                                >In telegram 16122 from London, July 26, 1982, the Embassy reported
                                on the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s sperm whale catch
                                limits. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D820386–0931)</note> indicate that sperm whaling in accordance with
                            paragraph 1 of the Summary of Discussions attached to your letter is not
                            inconsistent with the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s essential
                            conservation purposes. Moreover, in deciding that Japanese commercial
                            whaling in accordance with paragraph 2 of that Summary of Discussions
                            would not thwart the essential conservation purposes of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, I have noted the apparent purpose of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> in having itself provided for a
                            delayed effective date of paragraph 10(e).</p>
                        <p>This arrangement does not insulate from certification any Japanese
                            whaling in excess of the 1984–85 quota for Southern Hemisphere minke
                            whales. I urge that the Government of Japan comply with that quota.
                            Furthermore, the withdrawals of your government’s objections to footnote
                            1 to Table 3 and paragraph 10(e) of the Schedule would be irrevocable,
                            notwithstanding their prospective effective dates.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in judging whether the Government of the United States would
                            accept the catch limits for the 1986 and 1987 coastal seasons <pb
                                facs="0914" n="868" xml:id="pg_868"/> and 1985/86 and 1986/87
                            pelagic seasons as contemplated in paragraph 2 of the Summary of
                            Discussions, the Government of the United States would be guided by the
                            most recent quota voted by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            prior to those seasons.</p>
                        <p>Our purpose in recent consultations with the Government of Japan has been
                            to encourage adherence by the Government of Japan to all provisions of
                            the Convention’s Schedule. We regard the provisions of paragraph 10(e)
                            of the Schedule to be of central importance to the rational conservation
                            and management of the world’s remaining whale stocks. This is reflected
                            in President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s 1981
                            letter to each of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Commissioners
                            encouraging them to take action along the lines now reflected in

                        <p>On March 5, 1985 United States District Court Judge Richey ruled against
                            the United States Government on all aspects of the lawsuit filed by
                            several environmental organizations challenging the United States

                            The Department of Justice has filed for an immediate stay of the
                            decision, pending an appeal.</p>
                        <p>In the order Judge Richey opined that the Secretary of Commerce and the
                            Secretary of State do not have any discretion under the <persName

                                >Packwood</persName>) not to certify Japanese sperm whaling, in
                            excess of the International Whaling Commission’s (<gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) zero sperm whale quota, as
                            diminishing the effectiveness of the International Convention for the
                            Regulation of Whaling (Convention) and its conservation program.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Judge Richey orders the Secretary of Commerce to certify Japan
                            under both <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> and <persName

                            that the President will have to exercise his discretion under that

                                discrimination.</note> The implication of his order to certify Japan
                            under <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName> is that the
                            Secretary of State will have to reduce (no discretion) Japan’s directed
                            fisheries allocation by at least 50%.</p>
                        <p>Under the Federal Rules of Procedure (Rule 62) no proceeding to enforce
                            the order can be brought until the expiration of ten days after its
                            entry, i.e., before March 15, 1985. The Justice Department will appeal
                            this decision and seek a stay of the order pending appeal. In the first
                            instance a request for stay will be submitted to the District Court,
                            Judge Richey. It is probable that he will deny it. Next the request for
                            stay will be presented to the Appellate Court. Justice has indicated
                            that it is not possible to predict what the Appellate Court will do
                            until the composition of the Appellate panel is known.</p>
                        <p>If the decision is not overturned and/or the stay is denied, the actions
                            required by this order would overturn the November 13 arrangement
                            between the United States and Japan which provided that if the
                            Government of Japan withdraws its objection to the <gloss

                            13, 1984, to be effective no later than 1988, the United States would
                            not certify Japan and apply sanctions under the <persName

                            to 400 sperm whales each in the 1984 season and the next season. This
                            condition was met by Japan’s withdrawal of its objection on the sperm
                            whale prohibition on December 11, 1984. The decision would require the
                            immediate certification of Japan for diminishing the effectiveness of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Convention and its conservation
                            program for the taking of sperm whales (approximately 270 have been

                        <p>The decision would also nullify the second and most important part of the

                            and not be certified for such whaling. Also Japan may whale for, at

                            consultation with Japan, using as a guide the last quotas voted by the

                            whether the Japanese Government has made a decision, there have been
                            many indications that it is likely that Japan would have withdrawn its
                            objection to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> moratorium.</p>
                        <p>The U.S.-Japan fishing relationship is an important part of our bilateral
                            economic relationship, benefiting both the U.S. and Japan. Beyond the
                            major economic consequences if this decision were upheld, there are
                            serious legal and political ramifications.</p>

                        <p>Southern Hemisphere minke whales are caught primarily by the Soviet Union
                            and Japan; in the past the Japanese and the Soviets have negotiated
                            agreements allocating the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> quota
                            between the two. This year the two countries did not negotiate such an

                            minke whales (4,224 whales down from 6,655 last year). According to
                            information provided by the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics
                                (<gloss target="#t_BIWS_1">BIWS</gloss>), the Soviets caught 2,403
                            whales as of March 9, while the Japanese had caught 1,888, totaling
                            4,291. In mid-February, we informed the Soviets that, in the absence of
                            an agreement allocating the 1984/85 Southern Hemisphere minke whale
                            quota between Japan and the Soviet Union, we would look to past practice
                            to determine what level of Soviet and Japanese minke whaling is
                            consistent with <pb facs="0919" n="873" xml:id="pg_873"/> the current

                        <p>Soviet failure to hold their catch to 1,941 means that Commerce will
                            begin the certification process now that the overall <gloss

                            whale catch limit of 4,224 has been exceeded. A decision by the
                            Secretary of Commerce to certify the U.S.S.R. under <persName
                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> requires that the President
                            exercise his discretion under that statute as to whether to restrict the
                            importation of Soviet fishery products ($16.6 million in FY 1984)
                            consistent with provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
                                (<gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>). Certification of the
                            Soviets under <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName> requires
                            that the Secretary of State reduce (no discretion) the Soviet Union’s
                            directed fisheries allocation by at least 50% (we estimate this to be
                            about 70,000 metric tons for the 365 day period). Reduction of the
                            Soviet directed allocation could adversely affect Soviet participation
                            in joint ventures. This would have an adverse effect on an existing West
                            Coast joint venture, and could hamper current plans by U.S. fishermen to
                            develop new joint ventures. It could also hinder proposed efforts to
                            renegotiate the existing U.S.–U.S.S.R. fishing agreement, as well as a
                            potential access agreement to Soviet waters.</p>
                        <p>Certification can be lifted if “the reasons for which certification was
                            made no longer prevail.” The Commerce Department review of available
                            facts for possible termination of certification would include any change
                            in Soviet compliance with the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            non-explosive harpoon ban, and in particular Soviet compliance with the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> 1985/86 commercial whaling
                            moratorium. Therefore, Soviet agreement to withdraw their objection to
                            the moratorium such that they would cease all commercial whaling and
                            comply with the moratorium could meet Commerce’s criteria for lifting a
                            certification. If the certification is not lifted within a year from the
                            date of certification, all remaining allocations must be rescinded and
                            no more allocations can be made until the certification is
                            terminated.</p>

                            thus have a good chance to influence Iceland’s proposal in any way which
                            best suits our interests. We should, however, of course avoid the
                            pitfall of in any way committing ourselves to defend against charges and
                            possible actions by environmentalists who may consider the proposal as
                            simply a subterfuge in an effort on the part of the Icelanders to

                            point in terms of risking action against their important economic
                            interests in the U.S. for the sake of catching more whales, for whatever
                            purpose. What way to an effort to insulate them from the fire that may

                            different than it has been in the past. He notes it is not Prime
                            Minister Willoch’s style to bow to outside pressure, either from
                            governments or special interest groups, if Norway is living up to its

                        <p>3. Emboff first described points in reftel concerning U.S./Japan
                            arrangement to local Japanese Embassy Officer responsible for whaling;
                            he was generally aware the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would be
                            seeking to smooth the way for the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            meeting, but provided no details about his own demarche. Emboff then
                            discussed the upcoming <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting and
                            Norway’s thoughts with <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Legal
                            Advisor (and Norwegian <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Commissioner) Per Tresselt, who will lead the <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> Delegation. Tresselt was pleased Byrne will head <gloss
                                target="#t_USDel_1">USDel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Commercial Whaling. Despite intense probing, Tresselt parried all
                            attempts to determine whether the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>’s
                            approach to this annual <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting,
                            the last before the moratorium takes effect for Norway, would differ
                            from known policy and what <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would
                            expect. Emboff noted that some Norwegian politicians have informally
                            indicated it is only a matter of time before Norway would have to phase
                            out its limited whaling. Tresselt responded that Norway is on solid
                            legal ground and has always complied with the recommendations of the
                            Scientific Committee. He noted the result of the recent <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> certification of the Soviet
                            Union—fishing rights were affected (Norway has not fished in U.S.
                            waters), but Soviet exports of fish products to the U.S. were not.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d314fn5">See <ref target="#d312">Document
                                312</ref>.</note> He said it would cause some concern if the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> were to treat one of its closest
                            allies more harshly. Noting that significant pres<pb facs="0925" n="879"
                                xml:id="pg_879"/>sure might be brought to bear on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to do something, Emboff expressed
                            concern that U.S./Norwegian bilateral relations—so trouble free—could be
                            in for tough sledding next year. Tresselt said Prime Minister Willoch
                            has shown on other occasions that he does not believe it is in Norway’s
                            long-term interest to bow to outside pressure if Norway has consistently
                            lived up to its agreements and important interests are at stake.
                            Tresselt added that President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> had also shown he could resist pressure if he
                            thought he was right. When Emboff asked about the threat of private
                            boycotts in the U.S. against Norwegian fish imports, Tresselt responded
                            that if a matter of principle were at stake, the Prime Minister would
                            not be easily swayed.</p>
                        <p>5. Both Emboff and Tresselt expressed some regret that Norway and the
                            U.S. had not been able to work out a bilateral arrangement earlier,
                            agreeing that the U.S./Japan agreement would probably make it more
                            difficult to do so now. Tresselt reiterated that the “Japanese model” is
                            not a good one for Norway; the situation is just too different. Emboff
                            wondered aloud if the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> might be in a
                            position to show more flexibility about the future of Norwegian whaling
                            after the fall parliamentary elections. As expected, Tresselt did not
                            concede this would be the case. Finally, Tresselt said there is
                            considerable doubt the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is on firm
                            footing concerning its <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            obligations if it seeks to restrict legitimate trade in fish products
                            under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment. He
                            said the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has looked into this
                            question, and may well have come to the same conclusion.</p>
                        <p>6. U.S./Japan Arrangement. Tresselt agrees that the arrangement is not a
                            matter for <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> consideration. He noted,
                            however, that it could raise a question about our bilateral relations.
                            It would “be noticed” for example, if Japan continues to whale after
                            1986 and is not “punished” for this by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> but Norway is.</p>
                        <p>7. Finance and Administration Matters. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> agrees with reftel points on this topic. Tresselt said
                            Norway has run out of patience with Peru, and the special circumstances
                            which excused it before no longer apply.</p>
                        <p>8. Aboriginal/Subsistence Whaling. Tresselt noted that the Technical
                            Committee subcommittee had not yet made a decision. He said there was
                            some sentiment in Norway to hoist the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> with its own petard. He “hoped”, however, for
                            instructions which would enable him to be flexible enough to take into
                            account the interests of both our governments.</p>
                        <p>9. Future Activities of the Commission. Tresselt foresaw no major
                            differences with the U.S. Emboff specifically asked about Icelandic
                            intention to take whales under scientific permits, and noted last sen<pb
                                facs="0926" n="880" xml:id="pg_880"/>tence of talking point on this
                            issue in reftel.<note n="6" xml:id="d314fn6">The sentence reads, “In
                                this connection, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> may suggest
                                that the working group recommend that the Technical Committee
                                consider drafting a set of interpretive guidelines that may be of
                                use to contracting governments that may be contemplating the
                                exercise of their authority under Article VIII of the Convention to
                                issue scientific permits involving the taking of whales.”</note>
                            Tresselt said he saw no pressing need for interpretive guidelines. The
                            issue has been discussed in the Scientific Committee, with mixed
                            reactions. Nevertheless, Iceland has a great deal of legal leeway under
                            the basic 1946 agreement.</p>
                        <p>10. Action requested. Embassy has attempted for some time to obtain
                            information on <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> interpretation of
                            consistency of its obligations under the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"

                            into this issue; we know Tresselt is generally aware of it; and would
                            appreciate a readout, if only for our own internal guidance.<note n="7"

                            the general question of whaling for scientific purposes as well as the
                            specific Icelandic proposal. The <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> is
                            expected to comment on the Icelandic proposal at its 1986 meeting which
                            will occur at about the same time that the Icelandic whaling season

                            seem to offer compelling reasons not to undertake any whaling program

                        <p>The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister seem to have a realistic

                            pressure which would have a more defined, immediate and financially more
                            significant impact on the Iceland economy than sanctions. On January 15,

                        <p>When we met in November, I promised you that we would study possible U.S.
                            reaction to the proposed undertaking by Iceland of a scientific whaling
                            program without appropriate action by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"

                        <p>We have now obtained the view of the Secretary of Commerce, who is
                            responsible under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName>-Magnuson amendments
                            for reviewing the activities of other nations to determine whether such
                            activities would diminish the effectiveness of the International
                            Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (Convention) or its
                            conservation program.<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d315">Document 315</ref> and footnote 6 thereto.</note>
                            The Secretary of Commerce cannot provide any assurances that the
                            Icelandic proposal for scientific whaling and the resulting trade in
                            whale by-products with Japan during the moratorium would not be found to
                            diminish the effectiveness of the Convention or its conservation
                            program. The Department of Commerce is also of the view that whaling by
                            Iceland under its proposed scientific program, without appropriate
                            action by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, and trade in whale
                            by-products with Japan would be likely to require certification of
                            Iceland and Japan under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1"

                            and the resulting legislatively mandated reduction of fisheries
                            allocations in the U.S. exclusive economic zone would not have an
                            immediate impact on Iceland since Iceland does not presently receive
                            such allocations. However, it would affect allocations that Iceland
                            might receive in the future under the U.S.–Iceland governing
                            International Fisheries Agreement. However, sanctions under the
                                <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> amendment would most
                            likely affect both <pb facs="0930" n="884" xml:id="pg_884"/> Iceland and
                            Japan and result in restrictions on fisheries exports to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the effect of any U.S. Government sanctions, the active
                            opposition by U.S. private environmental groups would seem likely to
                            have a severe effect on the Icelandic fisheries trade with the U.S.
                            Should Iceland proceed without the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                            >IWC</gloss>’s having taken appropriate action, it could well find
                            itself in the position of having jeopardized a major source of foreign
                            exchange earnings.</p>
                        <p>We have reviewed your memorandum carefully, but in light of our
                            legislation we cannot give the assurances which you seek. In the years
                            we have worked together, wherever possible we have tried to accommodate

                                Embassy reported that the Government of Norway had filed a

                                list the minke whale as a protected stock with a zero quota.

                        <p>2. Summary and action requested: Norwegian <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> Commissioner Tresselt has predicted privately that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> will authorize a modest
                            northeast Atlantic minke whale hunt in 1986, hinting the quota will be
                            in the range of 150–350 animals. Tresselt said that the Norwegian
                            scientific studies will be presented to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee in May. He described the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> decision last fall to protect the
                            northeast Atlantic minke whale as unreasonable and expressed doubt the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> would act differently if the
                            issue were reopened. Tresselt claims to have received indications that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will not object to Iceland’s
                            plans for continued whaling, and he opined that any <gloss

                            Norway would not be understood here. Embassy infers from Tresselt’s
                            remarks that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> intends to
                            authorize a very small whaling quota at about the time of the <gloss

                            that such a small quota does not justify invoking <persName

                        <p>4. In an informal conversation at a reception, Per Tresselt, <gloss
                                target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Legal Advisor and Norway’s <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Commissioner, told <gloss
                                target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> that domestic pressures would in all
                            probability require the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> to
                            authorize a whaling quota for 1986. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss>-sponsored scientific study clearly justified a modest
                            quota. In addition, a second private Norwegian study indicated that even
                            a substantially larger quota would not harm the stock. Tresselt
                            commented that the findings of this second study appeared to be very
                            soundly based. The Whaling Conference in Svolvaer showed strong local
                            support for continued whaling in north Norway, a strategic area which
                            had been steadily losing population because of its declining
                                economy.<note n="4" xml:id="d317fn4">In telegram 1576 from Oslo,
                                March 11, the Embassy noted that the Government of Norway had
                                publicized a study on the minke whale stock at a conference in
                                Svolvaer. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D860186–0867)</note> (Comment: The communities in north Norway which
                            are the center of the whaling activity have been hit this year by the
                            twin blows of a disastrous fish catch and declining prospects for
                            offshore oil development, resulting from the drop in oil prices.)
                            Tresselt said he expects that any <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>
                            decision to overrule the Norwegian scientific conclusions by not
                            authorizing a quota would be severely criticized within the government
                            and Storting.</p>
                        <p>5. When asked, Tresselt said the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> did
                            intend to present its scientific data to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>’s Scientific Committee which meets next in May.
                            However, he said that the whaling season usually begins in late April or
                            May and that the government would be under pressure to authorize a quota
                            in time for the hunt to commence as usual. When it was noted that if the
                            quota were very small, delaying longer would not prevent completion of
                            the hunt, Tresselt did not respond. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                            said that Norway had thus far adhered to <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> decisions and expressed the hope that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> would not authorize a quota in
                            defiance of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. Tresselt then
                            noted that the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> had decided to
                            protect the northeast Atlantic minke whale despite the Scientific
                            Committee’s approval of a modest quota of about 350 for 1986. He termed
                            the protection unreasonable. Tresselt asked whether the US expected the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> would be more reasonable if the
                            issue were raised again. When <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>
                            demurred, Tresselt commented that he did not see much hope that the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> could be expected to be more
                            reasonable. Tresselt was quick to add that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> had appreciated the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> attitude when the issue was discussed at the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> last fall.</p>
                        <p>6. Tresselt then said that one question for the <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> was how big a quota to authorize. Speaking personally,
                            he said that if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>
                            should indicate to Foreign Minister Stray next week that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would not object to a quota of 150 and
                            would be prepared to see such a quota continue indefinitely, such views
                            would reinforce those <pb facs="0933" n="887" xml:id="pg_887"/> who were
                            calling for a very low quota. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> said
                            that he did not see how the Secretary would be in a position to do this,
                            particularly in the context of an indefinite continuation of Norwegian
                            whaling.</p>
                        <p>7. Tresselt then said that he had received the very strong impression
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would not object to
                            Iceland’s plans for a quota of about 200 whales per year. He also
                            interpreted the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s decision to
                            appeal the Japanese whaling issue to the Supreme Court as an indication
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was optimistic about
                            winning that case.<note n="5" xml:id="d317fn5">In telegram 211037 to all
                                East Asian and Pacific diplomatic posts, July 4, the Department
                                reported that Japan had dropped its objection after a June 30 5–4
                                Supreme Court ruling in favor of the agreement. (Department of
                                State, Central Foreign Policy File, D860516–0588)</note> In this
                            context, Tresselt said that any decision by the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to single out its ally Norway for particularly
                            stringent treatment would simply not be understood or accepted in
                            Norway. <gloss target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss> replied that he could not
                            comment authoritatively on Iceland, but that there were considerable
                            risks to Norway’s fishing interests implicit in any assumption that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would in fact have the
                            flexibility not to invoke <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            sanctions if Norway hunted in disregard of an <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> decision.</p>
                        <p>8. Tresselt said such a modest hunt might be described as being necessary
                            in order to protect other species or to avoid a growing whale stock
                            becoming a danger to fish farming along the Norwegian coast. He noted
                            that the US-Norway talks in 1984–5 about the possibility of defining
                            Norwegian whaling as non-commercial coastal whaling had broken down and
                            said he would be prepared to resume these talks if the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> wished.</p>
                        <p>9. Tresselt said he recognized there were risks but that the issue was an
                            emotional one in Norway. He noted in particular that Prime Minister
                            Willoch had decided views on the matter, and that Willoch was a man of
                            conviction who would not back down under pressure if he was convinced
                            that his position was justified. The conversation was then interrupted,
                            and Tresselt ended by saying he would have no objection to his personal
                            views being reported to Washington.</p>
                        <p>10. Comment: Tresselt is a careful diplomat who acts quite deliberately.
                            Embassy infers from his remarks that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> will present its scientific data to the <gloss

                            at about the same time and almost certainly before the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> itself meets in June, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> will approve a modest quota (probably
                            in the 150–350 range) for 1986, in the belief that there is no hope of
                            favorable <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> action and the
                            expectation that neither the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> nor
                            the environmentalists will take effective action against Norway for

                            environmentalists actions in response to continued Norwegian whaling
                            would harm Norway’s eco<pb facs="0934" n="888" xml:id="pg_888"

                            prominently in recent discussions of the Whaling issue. This probably
                            reflects the perception that neither the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> or the environmentalists will react in a way that will
                            harm Norway. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has everything to
                            gain domestically from authorizing a modest quota and it perceives that
                            it has little to lose internationally from doing so. While we have urged
                            the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> not to expect <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> flexibility under the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment, it is clear that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> believes we will exercise the
                            discretion which is available under the amendment.</p>
                        <p>12. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> also believes there is a
                            scientific basis for a modest hunt, a view that was endorsed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee last fall.
                            We are not aware what basis there is for concluding that such a modest
                            quota would “diminish the effectiveness of the International Convention
                            for the Regulation of Whaling.”</p>
                        <p>13. Whatever the merits of a hunt, we believe it essential in light of
                            Tresselt’s assertions, that Foreign Minister Stray be given an
                            authoritative statement of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            attitude toward Iceland’s plans for continued whaling and of the degree
                            of flexibility that we may be able to exercise under the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment should Norway
                            authorize a modest quota this year. Given Tresselt’s comments, we
                            believe <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> will interpret an absence
                            of comments to Stray as an indication of <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> acquiesence in a modest Norwegian quota. As recommended
                            previously, we believe the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should
                            also offer to support a <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> effort to

                        <p>2. Summary, recommendation and action requested: The whaling issue looms
                            as a major irritant in US-Norwegian relations, despite the minimal
                            economic significance of the hunt and despite (or perhaps here because
                            of) the uncertain scientific justification for the conservationists’
                            position. Whaling is an emotional issue, particularly in Norway, and
                            will require careful diplomacy in order to avoid unnecessarily harming
                            US–Norwegian relations.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has opted to go ahead with a
                            reduced 1986 harvest from the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                            >IWC</gloss>-protected northeast Atlantic minke whale stock. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has reacted to political and economic
                            pressures in north Norway in the belief that (A) such a minimal harvest
                            is justified on biological grounds, and (B) that the United States will
                            certify Norway under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            Amendment, but will not apply sanctions against Norwegian fish exports
                            to the United States.</p>
                        <p>4. The Embassy recommends that State and USDOC consider the <gloss

                            recommendation they will make to the President concerning certification
                            and sanctions. If a recommendation in favor of sanctions is chosen, we
                            believe this planned recommendation should be conveyed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> before the hunt starts in late
                                May.<note n="3" xml:id="d318fn3">In telegram 3195 from Oslo, May 16,

                        <p>5. We also request early, specific guidance on the consistency of

                            summary.</p>
                        <p>6. Now that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has announced a 1986
                            quota for the northeast Atlantic minke whale stock, contrary to the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> ruling, the United States faces
                            some difficult decisions. Since 1972, United States policy has aimed at
                            ending commercial whaling. The <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1"
                                >Packwood</persName> Amendment to the Magnusen Fishery Conservation
                            and Management Act and the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            Amendment to the Fishermen’s Protective Act clearly manifest the
                            congressional intent to give teeth to our support for an end to
                            commercial whaling. The US must now decide whether to certify Norway
                            under the above amendments and then whether to apply some level of
                            sanctions against Norwegian fish exports to the United States. The
                            circumstances of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> protection
                            ruling, the size of the proposed harvest, the stock assessment data, and
                            the wording of the above amendments leave wide open the question of
                            whether the proposed harvest will diminish the effectiveness of either
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> itself, or its conservation
                            program. The legislative reference to appropriateness of sanctions under
                            the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> may complicate the issue.
                            Further, the importance of our bilateral relationship requires that the
                            US refrain from a single dimensional analysis of Norway’s decision to go
                            against the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. We see three basic options available to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—(A) Do nothing</p>
                        <p>That is, withhold both certification under the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendments and any sanctions
                            that might otherwise have resulted from such certification. In true
                            biological and conservation terms, this option is justified by the low
                            level of the proposed harvest, the lack of scientific data indicating
                            that such a harvest would harm the stock, and the difficulty of
                            establishing that such a low harvest would, in fact, diminish the
                            effectiveness of either the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> or its
                            conservation program. This option would clearly be the option of choice
                            in terms of US-Norway relations, socioeconomic considerations, and the
                            strategic importance of north Norway, for the following reasons.</p>
                        <pb facs="0937" n="891" xml:id="pg_891"/>
                        <p>Refs A through C have tracked the process which culminated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>’s April 7 Cabinet decision to allow a
                            harvest of 350 minke whales from the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>-protected northeast Atlantic stock. Ref D provided a
                            more community-oriented view of this small-scale coastal whaling,
                            showing the importance of this activity to individual communities in
                            north Norway—a strategically important area that shares a common border
                            with the Soviet Union. Despite common references to whaling as a dying
                            tradition, the refs show that whaling represents the critical marginal
                            income that sustains coastal communities in an area characterized by
                            long-term depopulation trends. Whaling is, in fact, a profitable
                            enterprise—one that in years such as this, when cod harvests have hit
                            record low levels, sustains entire communities.</p>
                        <p>Further, the hunt is a cultural phenomenon. The coastal whale hunt is the
                            last remaining vestige of a whaling tradition that stretches back to the
                            pre-Christian era, while many of the whaling vessels are modern and
                            whalers earn profits from the harvest, the cultural aspects of this hunt
                            differ little from those of Alaskan Inuits whose subsistance depends on
                            the harvest of other small whales. Direct financial support from the
                                <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> could alleviate the economic
                            hardship resulting from a cessation of whaling, but such transfers are
                            inadequate from a social/cultural point of view.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has established a record of
                            whale conservation by reducing over time, first its high seas whaling
                            activities and now, its coastal whaling efforts. At each turn, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has reduced the harvest in
                            compliance with the best scientific data available and in compliance
                            with the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. As a result it has
                            repeatedly reduced the number of whaling licenses and forced individuals
                            to leave the fishery, thus inflicting economic harm on individuals
                            existing in a marginal, albeit strategic environment. At this point, the
                            whale harvest has been reduced to the minimum level that will allow its
                            continuation. Elimination of whaling activities will cost jobs, and will
                            run contrary to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s longstanding
                            policy of support for <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> efforts to
                            maintain population levels along <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s northern flank.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> Willoch is personally
                            involved in this issue. He is not persuaded that a moratorium on minke
                            whale hunting is justified. He is by nature a man of principle, who
                            firmly sticks by what he believes is right. During last September’s
                            national election, Willoch’s non-socialist coalition lost votes in
                            Norway’s rural areas, particularly the north. The loss of votes to the
                            opposition labor party cost the governing coalition its majority in the
                            Storting and has repeatedly made life politically difficult for the
                                <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss>. Willoch has tried to emphasize
                            his coalition’s support for the residents of rural Norway by increasing
                            funding for infrastructure development and social programs. The <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> decision to hold a hunt is an
                            important attempt to show support for these isolated communities.</p>

                        <p>—(B) Certification, plus possibly token sanctions</p>
                        <p>Certify Norway but implement either no sanctions or extremely limited,
                            token sanctions, reflecting the minimal and perhaps biologically
                            insignificant impact that the 350-whale harvest will have on the
                            protected northeast Atlantic minke stock. This is the option on which
                            the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> is counting. <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> officials have indicated that they
                            anticipate certification under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment, but are confident that actual sanctions
                            will be withheld, because they are not in accord with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>, and because the President would
                            exercise his discretion under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment in any case. Unlike Option A, this
                            option would satisfy to some extent anticipated domestic pressure for
                            action against Norway by allowing the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to clearly state through certification its opposition
                            to Norway’s continued whaling. By stopping short of significant
                            sanctions, it would also show the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>
                            that we recognize the depth of its whaling problem and show our
                            understanding for a strong ally. On the other hand, this would remove
                            any external pressure to encourage Norway to cease whaling and withdraw
                            its reservation to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> moratorium.
                            In the absence of such pressure, Norwegian whaling can be expected to
                            continue indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>—(C) Impose a proportionate sanction</p>
                        <p>Certify Norway and implement meaningful but proportionate sanctions
                            against specified Norwegian fish exports to the US, such as salmon, in
                            order to deny Norway any economic benefits from continued whaling. A
                            proportionate sanction could involve Norwegian fish products up to but
                            not exceeding the value of the whales being harvested. Such a
                            proportionate sanction would reflect a strong US commitment to seek an
                            end to Norwegian whaling. Collateral action to certify any other nation
                            buying whale meat from Norway, would reinforce the message by impacting
                            Norway in the marketplace.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> clearly does not anticipate that
                            this option will be implemented. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> will react strongly and challenge the US action under
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>. The public reaction will be
                            strong, and will be exacerbated by the perception that a super power is
                            picking on “Little Norway” and doing so without an adequate scientific
                            justification. This strong reaction might be tempered by the realization
                            that the sanction was proportionate to the whale catch—an argument that
                            may prove essential to avoid this issue seriously poisoning bilateral
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> will also be watching closely
                            how the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will treat Iceland’s plans
                            to hunt 200 whales for research purposes under these same
                                amendments.<note n="6" xml:id="d318fn6">See <ref target="#d315"
                                    >Documents 315</ref> and <ref target="#d316">316</ref>.</note>
                            Any perception that Norway is being treated less <pb facs="0939" n="893"
                                xml:id="pg_893"/> favorably than Iceland would only further
                            aggravate the Norwegian reaction to US sanctions.</p>
                        <p>8. Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>The Embassy believes that option B would be the most appropriate course,
                            both in the interest of maintaining strong bilateral relations, and as
                            an appropriate signal of US opposition to <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> whaling. However, if it is decided that significant
                            sanctions are necessary, we recommend that this be conveyed to the
                                <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> in forceful terms as early as
                            possible and that this be coupled with an effort to engage the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> in a negotiated end to Norwegian
                            whaling.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we recommend that such a decision be conveyed to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> in Washington and Oslo (by the
                            Ambassador) before the hunt starts in late May. This timing would help
                            forestall any Norwegian accusations that <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> statements concerning sanctions were vague and
                            imprecise.</p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> statement should contain a
                            clear justification of the US action under the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1"
                                >GATT</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> officials have
                            already said that they consider such action contrary to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> and will likely lodge an objection
                            in that forum if sanctions are undertaken. In deciding what sanctions to
                            impose, we must also weigh the options which Norway has available under
                            the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss> or otherwise to respond to or
                            retaliate against US sanctions. The <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                            >GON</gloss>’s emphasis on the <gloss target="#t_GATT_1">GATT</gloss>
                            aspects suggests that they will be carefully assessing their options,
                            though we have not yet heard any indications of possible retaliation. A
                            strong, and early justification will help convince the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> that we are indeed serious in
                            explaining our intention to recommend sanctions.</p>
                        <p>10. So far, the Norwegians have given no indication that they are willing
                            to consider negotiating an end to whaling. Their reasons are clear. They
                            believe whaling will be scientifically justified for the foreseeable
                            future and, equally important, they simply do not believe that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will implement meaningful
                            sanctions. That belief may change, however, if the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> is faced with a solid State-USDOC
                            recommendation to the President to impose meaningful sanctions against
                            Norwegian fish. Nor do they yet believe that the environmentalists will
                            be able to organize an effective boycott.</p>
                        <p>11. After the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> has time to absorb the
                            seriousness of our intent to recommend sanctions, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should offer negotiations similar to
                            those conducted with the Japanese to phase out whaling activities by a
                            set date. Our opening position could be an offer to withhold sanctions
                            this year in return for a total ban on Norwegian whaling next year. The
                            ongoing negotiations could justify a slight delay in implementing
                            sanctions and give the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> time to back
                            away from a difficult political problem. Should the negotiations fail,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would always retain the option
                            of increasing the sanction pressure at a later date. While <pb

                            arise. The early June visit to Washington by Nils Morton <persName

                            current circumstances, in judging Norwegian whaling, despite Norway’s
                            objections, as diminishing the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>

                                of State, Central Foreign Policy File, D860514–0814)</note></p>
                        <p>3. (C) The <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> program includes the
                            establishment of an independent committee of internationally recognized
                            whaling scientists to study the status of the whale stock and deliver
                            its first report by November 15.<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">Not
                                found.</note> That report will form the basis for establishment of
                            the 1987 whaling quota. <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Economics
                            Division Director General Bjorn Barth, accompanying Gjesteby, said the
                            1987 quota will definitely be lower than the 1986 quota of 400 animals.
                            He did not, however, specify a figure.</p>
                        <p>4. (C) Gjesteby noted that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>
                            decision included a statement that as part of its ongoing scientific
                            studies the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> envisaged authorizing a
                            program for scientific whaling. Gjesteby went on to say that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> had no intention of using such a
                            scientific program as a subterfuge for commercial whaling. Whatever
                            program was eventually developed would be fully consistent with the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> provisions concerning
                            scientific whaling.</p>
                        <p>5. (C) Gjesteby and Barth took pains, as did the Ministers in the press
                            conference, to point out that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>
                            decision was made unilaterally and on the basis of the best scientific
                            evaluation of available information. Barth said Norway is an
                            environmentally conscious country and wants to maintain that posture. He
                            added that the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> is “tired of being
                            criticized.” The establishment of an independent scientific committee
                            will be both a way to increase the overall body of scientific knowledge
                            about this whale stock, and a means to assure that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> is not in conflict with the best
                            scientific opinion. In response to a question from the <gloss
                                target="#t_DCM_1">DCM</gloss>, Barth said the actual makeup of the
                            scientific committee had not yet been determined, but he reiterated that
                            it would be composed of experts working independently of any
                            institutions which have previously been involved in this debate.</p>
                        <p>6. (C) Barth said the overall program was specifically designed to meet
                            what the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> perceives as the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> criteria for stopping the imposition
                            of sanctions. He said the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> expects
                            that Commerce Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName>
                            will take this <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> decision into
                            account.</p>
                        <p>7. (C) Barth also noted that the unilateral announcement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss>’s plan perhaps deprived the two
                            countries of an opportunity to negotiate the fine points of an
                            agreement. He stressed, however, that it was important for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> to be able to say that it acted on its
                            own <pb facs="0945" n="899" xml:id="pg_899"/> after lengthy and
                            deliberate evaluation. Foreign Minister Frydenlund and Fisheries
                            Minister Eidem struck a similar tone at the press conference. Asked to
                            what extent the decision was the result of <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> pressure, Eidem responded that decision was the result
                            of further analysis of the best scientific data available and of
                            Norway’s longstanding belief that all living marine resources must be
                            managed in the most scientifically responsible and defensible manner
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>8. (U) Both the Ministers in the press conference and Barth and Gjesteby
                            confirmed that the decision does not technically shut the door on a
                            resumption of commercial whaling at some time in the distant future. In
                            response to a direct question, Eidem told reporters that such a
                            resumption could become a reality, subject to an increase in whale
                            stocks, evaluation of newly developed data, and continued discussions
                            within the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. When specifically asked
                            for clarification of this point, Barth responded that such an answer was
                            necessary to satisfy whaling interests. He added, however, that after a
                            hunting ban of several years, the likelihood of a resumption was almost
                            zero.</p>
                        <p>9. (C) Comment: Interministerial discussions leading to the decision
                            continued until this morning, and until the last moment, it was feared
                            that Fisheries Minister Eidem would resign rather than agree to stopping
                            the hunt. The compromise decision to continue the hunt for another year
                            and to implement a scientific whaling program allowed Eidem to remain in
                            office. Foreign Minister Frydenlund reportedly played a central role in
                            working out the compromise which avoided Eidem’s resignation. Embassy
                            believes that this politically courageous decision by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> meets the criteria which the
                            Ambassador presented to Gjestery last week that commercial whaling be
                            terminated before 1988. End comment.</p>
                        <p>10. (U) Should we receive press and public inquiries about the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> decision, we plan to answer as
                            follows, pending more specific guidance:</p>
                        <p>Q. Has the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> been officially informed
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> decision?</p>
                        <p>A. Yes, the Embassy was called in by the <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss> July 3 and informed of the <gloss target="#t_GON_1"
                                >GON</gloss> decision to terminate minke whaling at the end of the
                            1987 season and to establish an international scientific commission to
                            assess the whale stock.</p>
                        <p>Q. What impact will this decision have on the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> certification of Norwegian non-compliance with the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> ban on minke whaling and the
                            prospect of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> imposed sanctions?</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has already certified that
                            Norway has not abided by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            decision. This certification was prompted by US legislation,
                            particularly the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment
                            to the Fishermen’s Protection Act.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has not yet decided what, if
                            any, further actions will be taken. The recent decision by the <gloss
                                target="#t_GON_1">GON</gloss> will, of course, be taken into account
                            in the ongoing <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> deliberations.</p>

                                >NOAA</gloss> and U.S. <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Commissioner, respectively, met July 7 in Washington to discuss
                            Iceland’s “scientific” whaling. A small working group met on July 8 for
                            more detailed discussions. The two sides presented differing
                            interpretations of the paragraph in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> resolution on scientific permits which recommends that
                            quote following the completion of scientific treatment the meat as well
                            as other products should be utilized primarily for local consumption
                            unquote. The Icelandic side held the view that Iceland’s small size and
                            dependence on exports (90 percent of products are exported),
                            particularly fisheries (76 percent of exports), require special
                            consideration in interpreting this paragraph. A film was shown which
                            underscored this dependence. The U.S. expressed the view that the intent
                            of the resolution was to take commercial elements out of scientific
                            whaling and to set a limit on the number of whales taken in order to
                            avoid undermining the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> commercial
                            whaling moratorium. The meetings ended with commitment by <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> to provide <gloss target="#t_USG_1"

                        <p>3. On the issue of local consumption, it was explained that Iceland was
                            different than large countries or those less dependent upon trade
                            (exports contribute more than half of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1"
                                >GNP</gloss>). The Icelanders explained that there was a stockpile
                            of lamb and ox (?) meat and therefore, with Iceland’s small population,
                            little hope of increasing consumption of whale meat significantly. The
                            Icelanders emphasized that the purpose of the program was to contribute
                            to scientific knowledge for the comprehensive assessment and to
                            knowledge of the whales ecosystem because fish (which whales and fish
                            consume in large quantities) are so very important to the Icelandic
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>4. Gudmundur Eiriksson, Legal Adviser to <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss>, pointed out there were three elements of this
                            paragraph on local consumption in the resolution on scientific whaling
                            that led the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> to believe that its
                            case-by-case approach was appropriate: 1) Begins with “recommends, 2)
                            the use of “should” and not shall, and 3) the use of the word
                            “primarily” and not all. In Eiriksson’s view the Icelanders would be
                            enhancing the effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            in implementing its scientific whaling program.</p>
                        <p>5. In response to U.S. query, the Icelandic side indicated that
                            approximately 10 percent of the whale meat would be consumed within
                            Iceland (150 to 200 tons). The 120 great whales (80 Fin and 40 Sei)
                            would produce about 1500 to 2000 tons. They stated that in the past,
                            when more whales were taken, 3–5 percent of the whale meat was consumed.
                            They further explained that they expect to increase utilization. The
                            U.S. side responded that even with a 100 percent increase only 20
                            percent would be consumed locally. In the U.S. view, this was the
                            reverse of the appropriate interpretation of the amount to be exported
                            to meet the criterion for “primarily for local consumption.”</p>
                        <p>6. The <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> on several occasions stressed
                            that the Icelandic scientists had been under strict instructions to plan
                            a scientific program with the bare minimum number of whales to be taken
                            necessary to provide useful scientific results. The scientists would be
                            asked again if the number could be reduced. The program was also
                            designed to provide no profit for the whaling operation involved.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> demarche (ref B),
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> officials made presentation
                            concerning minke whales. At the present time the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> has only granted permits for great
                            whales because the facilities for research are available and whaling is
                            localized. The minke whaling on the other hand involves a small,
                            scattered operation using 9 vessels of 15–30 tons. Plans now call for
                            reducing the operation to 3 or 4 vessels and 2 landing sites to
                            guarantee thorough expedited scientific processing of the whales. Until
                            this is arranged, the permits will not be issued.</p>
                        <pb facs="0948" n="902" xml:id="pg_902"/>
                        <p>8. Icelanders confirmed U.S. understanding that minke whale meat was
                            preferred by Icelanders. The blubber is pickled (soured) and eaten in
                            the winter with, we were told, vast quantities of aquavit. If the meat
                            from the 80 minke whales proposed to be taken was all consumed locally,
                            then approximately 120 tons of meat would be eaten (about one and a half
                            tons of meat per minke whale). (We observe that this will leave
                            virtually all of the meat from the great whales for export.)</p>
                        <p>8 [9]. The <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> plans to implement the
                            use of explosive harpoons in the minke whaling operation. They will use
                            the same mechanism developed and currently utilized for Norwegian minke
                            whaling operations, but no firm purchase order has yet been placed.
                            Apparently a small firm in Switzerland makes the necessary trigger
                            mechanism and will require a year to make delivery. It was also pointed
                            out that in addition to the delivery problem, it will be necessary to
                            teach inexperienced whalers to incorporate the necessary precautions and
                            safety measures.</p>
                        <p>9. [10.] In the smaller meeting held on July 8, Mr. Eiriksson presented
                            list of arguments that U.S. could use against assertions that Icelandic
                            whaling was diminishing the effectiveness of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>: 1) Iceland’s proposed research
                            program is dedicated to science. 2) The <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> was not seeking to circumvent the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> moratorium on commercial whaling. (Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> had indicated on July
                            7 that he was convinced that this was the case). 3) As requested by the
                            U.S., the proposal as now drafted took account of <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee comments (e.g.
                            excluding any taking of blue or humpback whales). 4) Research is
                            mandated by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. It is part of the
                            comprehensive assessment which is incorporated in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> commercial whaling moratorium
                            decision. Iceland considers its research proposal as necessary to
                            provide information for the comprehensive assessment which the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> interprets as necessary by 1990. 5)
                            Iceland’s program is consistent with the terms of the resolution. 6) The
                            question of local consumption should be treated on a case by case basis.
                            Iceland’s special situation discussed above would justify the 10–20
                            percent level of consumption.</p>
                        <p>10. [11.] U.S. responded that a large segment of the U.S. population and
                            many members of Congress are carefully observing Iceland’s activity and
                            the U.S. reaction. While aspects of Eiriksson’s argument could be
                            persuasive, in the U.S. view the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            resolution on scientific whaling does not allow such a broad
                            interpretation. Our interpretation of primary requires that
                            substantially more than 10 percent of the whale meat be consumed in
                            Iceland.</p>
                        <p>11. [12.] The Icelandic side pointed out that if the U.S. had the desire
                            to interpret U.S. regulations favorably, then there certainly was a
                            basis for deciding that the Icelandic scientific whaling proposal
                            actually enhanced the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Convention.
                            As an example of this “if there is a <pb facs="0949" n="903"
                                xml:id="pg_903"/> will there is a way scenario” it was explained
                            that the U.S. base in Iceland has been the beneficiary of many favorable
                            interpretations of Icelandic law, often requiring great effort by <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> officials. (At a lunch hosted by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> on July 8, a <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> official was told that if the US
                            threatens Iceland’s fisheries (even if certified without sanctions), the
                            US base would no longer be welcome).</p>

                        <p>2. In a letter to Norwegian Ambassador Eliassen dated July 23, Secretary
                            of Commerce <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> made the
                            following points:<note n="5" xml:id="d323fn5">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p>—On June 9, 1986, the Secretary of Commerce certified to the President,

                            Fishermen’s Protective <pb facs="0950" n="904" xml:id="pg_904"/> Act of
                            1967, that Norwegian nationals were conducting whaling operations that
                            diminished the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission
                                (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) conservation program.</p>
                        <p>—Under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment, when
                            the Secretary of Commerce determines that a foreign country is
                            conducting a fishing operation that diminishes the effectiveness of an

                            determination to the President. After receiving a certification, the
                            President may direct the Secretary of the Treasury to embargo the
                            offending country’s fishery products to the limits of the General

                            action taken under the certification.</p>
                        <p>—On July 3, 1986, the Government of Norway announced that, inter alia, it
                            would suspend commercial whaling after the 1987 season and that 1987
                            catch limits would be lower than this year’s 400.</p>
                        <p>—The Secretary of Commerce has made a recommendation to the President
                            concerning trade sanctions under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"

                        <p>1639. Subject: Whaling Dispute: How Much Damage? What Next?</p>
                        <p>1. (C—Entire text.)</p>
                        <p>Summary:</p>
                        <p>2. Apart from the cod wars, nothing in Iceland’s history as an
                            independent nation has aroused such strong emotion and inflamed
                            nationalism here to the extent that the whaling dispute with the U.S.
                            has. Indeed, in the case of the series of cod wars in 1958, 1972, and
                            1975, in which the U.K. resisted, unsuccessfully, Iceland’s successive
                            expansions of its exclusive fisheries zone to 200 miles, everyone here
                            recognized that the British, who are also a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> ally, had a conflicting economic interest of its own
                            at stake. In the case of the whaling dispute, the point has been made by
                            contacts to every officer in this Embassy that Icelanders are outraged
                            by the perception that the U.S. appointed itself as the judge and jury
                            on whaling issues and, in so doing, assumed the authority for telling
                            Iceland how to conduct its scientific whaling program in its own waters
                            and how to market the resulting products. The political impact of this
                            in Iceland is of considerable long-term importance. This is an episode
                            which will be remembered and discussed in political circles for years to
                            come. While Icelanders may differ in their views over how the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> should have handled this problem and,
                            indeed, whether the scientific whaling program should have been launched
                            in the first place, they are remarkably united across the entire
                            political spectrum in their sense of outrage. It is too early to predict
                            how the nationalistic sentiments which have been unleashed will play out
                            or which political leader will prove most skillful at exploiting this.
                            However, it is clear that there has been a shift in perceptions of the
                            U.S. As a result, we now have to work very hard to ensure that our
                            actions in the future avoid inflaming this nationalism and, to the
                            extent possible, reassure Iceland that we are a reliable friend and
                            ally.</p>
                        <p>3. To do this we need a coherent policy. Initially, this means a clear
                            explanation of what the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did and why
                            so that we can begin getting our side of the story across because
                            Icelanders are presently getting a very one-sided account of the whaling
                            dispute. But much more is needed if we are to stem the damage to the
                            U.S. position here. In particular, <pb facs="0952" n="906"
                                xml:id="pg_906"/> we must: (A) avoid giving the impression that the
                            U.S. is interfering in any way with Japanese purchases of Icelandic
                            whale products, (B) do our best to avoid a replay of the whaling dispute
                            next year, and (C) convey the view that we are moving as quickly and as
                            forcefully as possible to resolve our other dispute with Iceland over
                            the transportation of military cargo. End summary.</p>
                        <p>4. The nature and scope of the damage: We have reported on the depth of
                            emotion and nationalism aroused by the whaling dispute. However, there
                            has also been a perceptible shift in positions and views in Iceland as a
                            result of this dispute. For example, PolOff had a revealing conversation
                            with Styrmir Gunnarsson, editor of <hi rend="italic">Morgunbladid,</hi>
                            Iceland’s most widely read and influential paper. PolOff has known
                            Styrmir, who is a key figure in the Independence Party (IP), well for a
                            little over a year. In both editorials and personal conversations,
                            Styrmir has been a staunch supporter of Iceland’s defense relationship
                            with the U.S. and repeatedly opposed the notion that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> should link the U.S.-manned <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> base at Keflavik to other issues and
                            use the leverage to get its way in disputes. This appears to have
                            changed. In an August 13 conversation, after describing at length the
                            very high level of emotions and nationalism inflamed by this issue,
                            which are “like nothing experienced here in recent years,” he went on to
                            say that if the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> continues to treat
                            Iceland the way it has in the whaling dispute, Iceland would have to use
                            the presence and strategic importance of the base for leverage. When
                            PolOff expressed his dismay at this statement in view of his past
                            position and clear understanding of the base’s importance, he simply
                            replied that U.S. behavior made it impossible for Iceland to deal with
                            the U.S. “without using this card.”</p>
                        <p>5. The point has also been made to a number of us that the military cargo
                                dispute,<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">In telegram 1810 from
                                Reykjavik, September 10, the Embassy reported, “During the period
                                1967–1984, Icelandic vessels carried supplies for the defense force
                                in Iceland. This activity proved to be reliable for the U.S.
                                military and important to Iceland by utilizing available space on
                                the return voyage of Icelandic vessels carrying fishery products to
                                the United States market. Then, suddenly, in 1984 an American
                                company, Rainbow Navigation, Inc., entered this route claiming
                                preferential treatment on the basis of a 1904 Cargo Preference Act,
                                which provided that American Government property should be carried
                                on U.S. vessels.” (Ibid.)</note> which remains unresolved despite
                            over two years of diplomatic effort, worked in a pernicious way
                            throughout the whaling dispute to intensify Icelandic frustrations.
                            There is a widely held view here that “Washington” has been unwilling to
                            come to grips with the military cargo issue because the IP, which has
                            always advocated a close defense relationship with the U.S. and opposed
                            linking the base to other issues, is unwilling to play Iceland’s
                            strongest card, the base. This view has made many in the IP very
                            nervous, especially since there <pb facs="0953" n="907" xml:id="pg_907"
                            /> is about a fifty-fifty chance of parliamentary elections this year.
                            This, in turn, seems to be an important factor in the shift in position
                            by Styrmir Gunnarsson and others in the IP leadership.</p>
                        <p>6. This shift in views is not limited to the IP—it spans the entire
                            political spectrum in Iceland apart from the leftists in the People’s
                            Alliance who are using the episode to show that they have been right all
                            along in saying that Iceland cannot rely on the U.S. Indeed, these
                            disputes have provoked numerous calls from all quarters here for greater
                            self-reliance in foreign affairs and for the need to reduce Iceland’s
                            dependence on U.S. fish markets. With regard to the latter, while we
                            believe recent trends in exchange rates are responsible for the growing
                            interest by exporters in markets other than the U.S., the greater
                            attention being paid to other potential customers is being justified in
                            political terms.</p>
                        <p>7. It is important to recognize that at this juncture the political
                            dimensions of the whaling and shipping disputes take on greater
                            importance than the economic aspects. Icelanders have reacted strongly
                            not because of fear of loss of revenues or jobs but rather because they
                            perceive the U.S. to be interfering in Iceland’s internal affairs and
                            ignoring Iceland’s legitimate interests. This offends their strong sense
                            of nationalism. Iceland, which only became independent in 1944 and only
                            has a population of about a quarter of a million people, is very
                            sensitive about such interference. Moreover, because the U.S. has no
                            economic interest at stake in the whaling dispute, unlike the military
                            cargo dispute, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> behavior in this
                            matter was all-the-more incomprehensible and outrageous in the view of
                            the Icelandic public.</p>
                        <p>8. What must be done? In order to present the U.S. case in both private
                            discussions and to the media, we need a statement of some kind making
                            clear that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, 1) will not certify
                            Iceland for its whaling activities as now agreed upon by the two
                            countries, 2) that from a bilateral standpoint this issue is currently
                            over, 3) that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is not
                            intervening in any way to prevent a Japanese purchase of whale meat from
                            Iceland, and 4) that the “impreciseness” of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> resolution will be addressed within a multilateral
                            framework and that the U.S. looks forward to working together with
                            Iceland within the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> to make certain
                            that further misunderstandings of this kind are avoided. With regard to
                            the latter point, we would encourage Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> to continue to nurture the very useful personal
                            relationship that now exists between himself and Halldor Asgrimsson. We

                            end whaling now before the next whaling season (1987/88). We agreed with
                            Commerce that if the Soviets find this unacceptable, the certification

                            unable to come to a consensus on such matters. But more importantly, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> was concerned about the
                            appropriateness of submitting their scientific whaling program to a vote

                            motives, they thought, and thus the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>
                            was reluctant to submit their program to it for a vote. Throughout the
                            visit, the Icelandic side expressed their belief that, in fact, the U.S.
                            proposal was aimed at stopping Iceland from carrying out scientific
                            whaling. While the results of the visit could be viewed as inconclusive,
                            there is reason to believe that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"

                            concerning scientific permits and that each in his own way was working

                            minutes, took place at Althing. <persName corresp="#p_MMA_1"
                                >Mathiesen</persName> underscored the importance of maintaining good
                            relations with the U.S. and asked that everything be done to accomplish
                            this. In a gesture toward Ambassador, Foreign Minister pointed to other
                            recent obstacles having been surmounted commenting that amicable
                            relations must be preserved. He looked to Ambassador to contribute again
                            toward this end. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> in
                            turn responded that it was also his wish to maintain good relations.
                            While Iceland and the U.S. did not see eye-to-eye on whaling matters, he
                            thought some way must be found to resolve differences. McGovern stated
                            that a positive element was that both sides involved in whaling matters
                            now knew each other well and this would reduce any chance of
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>4. Rest of afternoon taken up with meeting devoted, for the most part, to
                            whaling issues including a detailed briefing on Iceland’s research
                            program. On Icelandic side, meeting attended by Fisheries Minister,
                            Secretary General of Fisheries Ministry Arni Kolbeinsson, Kjartan
                            Juliusson, Whale Division Director at Ministry, Jakob Jakobsson,
                            Director of Marine Research Institute, Johann Sigurjonsson, a Marine
                            Biologist at the Institute, and Gudmundur Eiriksson, Foreign Ministry
                            Legal Adviser accompanied by an assistant. Throughout almost entire
                            visit Eiriksson and his assistant were sole representatives from Foreign
                            Ministry.</p>
                        <pb facs="0958" n="912" xml:id="pg_912"/>
                        <p>5. Meeting began with Johann Sigurjonsson describing various elements of
                            Iceland’s research program including efforts to obtain age and
                            reproduction data (has greater availability of food resulted in speeding
                            up of fin whale growth rate and therefore sexual maturity?), energetics,
                            food and food-web (what is the relationship between Capelin and Humpback
                            whale stocks?), June/July 1986 minke whale aerial survey (consultations
                            with European and American scientists on interpretation of data not yet
                            complete), and killer whale movement and population studies (what is
                            their role in the ecosystem? Photo ID of over 120 completed so far).</p>
                        <p>6. With regard to Icelandic efforts to get North Atlantic sighting survey
                            under way this year, Sigurjonsson and Jakobsson explained that progress
                            had been made in obtaining resources (8 vessels and 4 aircraft) from
                            Norway, Faroes, Denmark and the Nordic Council. Given the area to cover
                            stretching from Norway to southern tip of Greenland, Iceland also sought
                            participation of U.S., <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> and Spanish
                            scientists. Area to be surveyed could then possibly be extended to seas
                            off the coasts of those countries. Management workshops had already
                            taken place and two more were scheduled for late March. Planning
                            sessions were organized for April/May with start of survey to take place
                            in June. Throughout briefing, Icelandic side repeated that 1987 North
                            Atlantic survey was intended as a major contribution to <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> comprehensive assessment. Indeed, the
                            major thrust of their argument was that rhetoric surrounding discussion
                            of the issue in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> was intended,
                            in their view, as a delaying tactic and that their actions proved that a
                            comprehensive assessment could be completed by 1990. In response, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> expressed some
                            surprise that he had not known extent of planning for this survey, to
                            which Halldor Asgrimsson replied that developments had come slowly. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> said he would look
                            into possibility of encouraging participation by U.S. scientists
                            including possible material resources. He agreed that international
                            cooperation was essential to a comprehensive assessment.</p>
                        <p>7. Fisheries Minister then intervened to say with regard to U.S. proposed
                            resolution concerning scientific permits, that question of utilization
                            of whale meat had not been addressed. American interpretation of
                            “primarily for local consumption” contained in June 1986 resolution on
                            special permits had been difficult to accept, he said, especially given
                            small Icelandic population.<note n="5" xml:id="d326fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d322">Document 322</ref>.</note> Nevertheless, this was
                            history and he did not wish to return to the question again. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> commented that it was
                            his purpose to get a better understanding of how other <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>-member countries saw the US-proposed
                            resolution on scientific permits <pb facs="0959" n="913" xml:id="pg_913"
                            /> and, on this score, it was essential that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> get Iceland’s views early on. After
                            consultations with the Minister last August, the U.S. had concluded that
                            it was best not to return to the resolution agreed to in Malmo given its
                            ambiguity. Thus, his purpose in coming to Iceland was to search for a
                            resolution of differences and not to impose the will of the U.S. on
                            Iceland. He sought to avoid volatility and an escalation of animosity,
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> said. At this point
                            the U.S. side distributed two scientific papers (“The Role of Special
                            Scientific Permits in Meeting the Research Objectives of the
                            Comprehensive Assessment of Whale Stocks” by Howard Brabham, and
                            “Problems in the Reanalysis of Past Data for the Comprehensive
                            Assessment of Whale Stocks” by Douglas Chapman)<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d326fn6">Neither found.</note> which were intended to help
                            establish a link between research and the comprehensive assessment. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> also stressed that
                            even the suggestion of a comprehensive assessment had been resisted by
                            American environmentalist groups as little as twelve months ago, but
                            that they had now come around to accepting such an exercise. He felt
                            this was significant progress. His hope was that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> could adopt the four criteria
                            contained in the U.S. resolution on scientific permits and thus have a
                            way of judging whether the granting of special permits contributed to
                            the comprehensive assessment. It was not the intent of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to push the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> in any direction, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> said. The problem, he stated, was that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> was “walking away” from difficult
                            decisions and would not take a position. It was his objective to come up
                            with a way for the U.S. to abide by its laws while obviating the need
                            for unilateral imposition of sanctions.</p>
                        <p>8. Asgrimsson responded to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName>’s remarks with a declaration that a comprehensive
                            assessment was also important to Iceland, but that it was also important
                            to let scientists decide for themselves how best to get results and not
                            subject their proposals to a vote. It was essential that Iceland be
                            allowed to carry out research as it saw fit. The Minister said he had no
                            faith in the judgment of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s
                            Scientific Subcommittee and that members were too susceptible to
                            political pressures. In short, he was concerned about what would come
                            out of the Scientific Subcommittee and was not willing to be bound by
                            its views. Further, the view of the full committee inevitably contained
                            three or four opinions anyway. While scientific merit was not something
                            one could vote on, he said, it was another thing to seek the views of
                            others. In response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName>’s comments that his purpose was to get movement
                            toward a comprehensive assessment by focussing attention on criteria and
                            that it was possible to set limits and still respect a divergence of
                            views, Asgrimsson asked why the U.S. could not simply <pb facs="0960"
                                n="914" xml:id="pg_914"/> go forward with a comprehensive assessment
                            based on Iceland’s research so far. He did not understand what danger to
                            stocks there could be by virtue of scientific whaling. Catches were not
                            excessive, he said. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>
                            in turn responded that if moratorium on commercial whaling was ever to
                            be lifted, members would need to have the results of a comprehensive
                            assessment and that currently there was no criteria in place. The result
                            of inaction in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> would be that
                            the organization would drift for perhaps another five years. If this
                            were to happen, he could foresee a repetition of the US/Iceland
                            bilateral confrontation in 1987, and each year after that.</p>
                        <p>9. McGovern intervened at this point saying that in fact much of the
                            opposition to a comprehensive assessment was based on the fear of some
                            that it would produce wrong answers, that is, results which could
                            justify lifting the ban on commercial whaling. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, however, had succeeded in convincing
                            opponents that the only way to apply discipline to scientific programs
                            was to move forward on a comprehensive assessment and agree on criteria
                            by which scientific proposals could be tested. The objective, he said,
                            was to bring skeptics to the conclusion that the purpose of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> was to manage stocks, not simply to
                            preserve them. McGovern repeated Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName>’s earlier statement that at this point a
                            repetition of last year’s bilateral confrontation was inevitable and
                            therefore both sides must manage the problem. The error last year, he
                            thought, was in trying to get at scientific legitimacy by focussing on
                            consumption and use. Therefore, this year the U.S. was aiming at getting
                            agreement on scientific criteria. The way to decide whether a scientific
                            program undercut an internationally agreed upon conservation regime was
                            for the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> to say so. McGovern
                            concluded his remarks by saying that in his view the ambiguity of the
                            resolution on special permits agreed to in Malmo had allowed varying
                            interpretations and that this had led to feelings of bad faith.
                            Therefore, the ambiguity needed to be cleared up.</p>
                        <p>10. The remainder of March 5 afternoon meeting was devoted to a brief
                            discussion of four criteria contained in U.S. proposal. On this score,
                            Fisheries Minister thought Iceland’s scientific program could probably
                            stand up under all four. What concerned him, he stated, was the notion
                            of voting, devising procedures and getting the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> to come to grips with issues. In response to
                            expressions of frustration by Icelandic side at apparent inability of
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Subcommittee to come
                            to a consensus, <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> agreed
                            that at present it was in effect a debating society, but that if
                            confronted with the need to make a decision, it could be sufficiently
                            disciplined to produce one. Fisheries Minister then stated that if the
                            U.S. sought solutions, his suggestion would be to change American law.
                            “You can’t save the world,” he commented. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> responded that if the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> attempted to change the law, the
                            result was likely to be a much stiffer one.</p>
                        <pb facs="0961" n="915" xml:id="pg_915"/>
                        <p>11. Next day began with <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName>,
                            McGovern and EconOff traveling with Arni Kolbeinsson and <gloss
                                target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> Representative to Westman Islands to
                            observe fishing operations. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> was unable to take part in this part of visit.
                            With the agreement of both sides, the afternoon was spent meeting again
                            to resume discussion of whaling matters. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1"
                                >Evans</persName> began with a brief description of scientific
                            papers distributed the day before emphasizing that Iceland was the first
                            country to see them, that intent was to discuss them fully at June 1–13
                            Scientific Subcommittee meeting, and that they were intended to tighten
                            theories and provoke action, not rhetoric. Johann Sigurjonsson’s
                            reactions were almost uniformly negative saying that they were general
                            and without detail and that in his view result would be discussion of
                            comprehensive assessment in terms of paper work with no action. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> responded that papers
                            were intended to stimulate thinking and did not necessarily reflect the
                            views of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. He agreed that we
                            needed to get started toward agreement on launching of comprehensive
                            assessment by 1990 but did not understand how the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> intended to get there.</p>
                        <p>12. Halldor Asgrimsson commented that in his view the question was, does
                            the U.S. proposal promote the carrying out of a comprehensive
                            assessment. He could conclude, he thought, that in fact its intent was
                            to stop scientific whaling. It was essential that the first step be to
                            address the question of how to accomplish a world-wide comprehensive
                            assessment, like the one Iceland had already begun. Following that, the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> could take up criteria on
                            special permits. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>
                            responded that it was not his intent to propose criteria for special
                            permits, but merely to get at the question of whether scientific whaling
                            contributed toward a comprehensive assessment. Thus it was essential
                            that the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> focus on the definition of
                            a comprehensive assessment. McGovern asked whether the price for
                            Icelandic support of the U.S. resolution on scientific permits was a
                            call for action on a comprehensive assessment and that in turn the price
                            for support of a comprehensive assessment was <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> review of special permits to assure no abuse. Gudmundur
                            Eiriksson responded that in fact the price for Iceland supporting the
                            U.S. proposal was giving up its right to conduct scientific whaling.
                            McGovern in turn thought that the issue arousing most interest this year
                            was special permits. This being the case, the U.S. objective was to
                            channel that enthusiasm toward the goal of accomplishing a comprehensive
                            assessment.</p>
                        <p>13. Discussion then turned to questions of tactics and how each, in his
                            own way, was contributing toward acceptance of the need for the startup
                            of a comprehensive assessment. In response to Asgrimsson’s comment that
                            the U.S. wanted Iceland to stop scientific whaling, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> said this was not necessarily
                            the case and that in fact continuation of scientific whaling was
                            building pressure for acceptance of a compre<pb facs="0962" n="916"
                                xml:id="pg_916"/>hensive assessment. It occured to him, however,
                            that the June meeting of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> might
                            be too early to get acceptance of the U.S. resolution and that it might
                            be wiser to aim for completion of deliberations in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> by early 1988. These were questions he
                            would be taking up soon during consultations with other <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> members including Nordic Group and
                            Europeans. Asgrimsson then said that it was clear that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> could not support U.S. resolution but
                            that both sides must continue discussing matters and keep up pressure
                            for a comprehensive assessment. Picking up on earlier comments, his view
                            was that Iceland’s scientific program was helping to bring this about.
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> agreed but said this
                            was a sensitive matter which needed to be handled discreetly. It was
                            essential to stay in close communication, Asgrimsson said. Discussion
                            concluded with Fisheries Minister’s offer to assist Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> in arranging meetings with
                            Nordics, if need be. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>
                            thought it important to keep in mind that movement in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> toward a comprehensive assessment
                            could result in consensus that work on the survey would not involve the
                            taking of whales. In this event, it would be important to come up with
                            wording to the effect that <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> members
                            continued to enjoy the sovereign right to determine their own actions.
                            McGovern commented that US/Icelandic cooperation in this year’s North
                            Atlantic Survey could also contribute toward getting agreement for a
                            comprehensive assessment.</p>
                        <p>14. March 6 meeting then concluded with a brief discussion of Iceland’s
                            plans to prevent the Sea Shepherd Organization from attending the next
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting as an observer. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was aware of Iceland’s interest
                            in denying Sea Shepherd an opportunity to be present as a
                            non-governmental organization, McGovern said, and the U.S. was prepared
                            to offer its support if it could be accomplished without undue
                            embarrassment to the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>. Further, it was important to deny Sea Shepherd the
                            publicity that it sought. Therefore, U.S. suggested early consultations
                            with the Chair and other <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> members.
                            Icelandic side said they had written to a number of delegations in order
                            to seek their views. Although the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s
                            current thinking was to bring the matter up at the first <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting, the U.S. suggested approach
                            and concerns would be taken into account. Iceland’s aim was also to deny
                            Paul Watson any opportunity for publicity.</p>
                        <p>15. In order to prevent the possibility of any misunderstanding, both
                            sides agreed that it would be useful to meet again for an hour prior to
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>’s departure for
                            Washington. Therefore, on March 7 Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName>, McGovern, <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1"
                                >Evans</persName>, Ambassador and EconOff met at Keflavik Airport
                            with Gudmundur Eiriksson, Arni Kolbeinsson and Kjartan Juliusson.
                            Eiriksson, who appeared to have a mandate to speak for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>, stated that as a result of discussion
                            over the last two days it was the impression of the Icelandic
                            participants that the U.S. side had put <pb facs="0963" n="917"
                                xml:id="pg_917"/> into abeyance the U.S. 4-point resolution on
                            scientific permits and that it would go forward with efforts to bring
                            about agreement on a comprehensive assessment. This in fact would
                            satisfy the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>, Eiriksson said, since
                            it was the opinion of his colleagues that the U.S. should “relax” and
                            that the compromise agreed to in August 1986 was sufficient to prevent
                            further friction until at least 1990. In short, the U.S. proposed
                            resolution was unnecessary, Eiriksson thought. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> stated that the need for this
                            last meeting was to clarify what appeared to be the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s incorrect understanding of the U.S.
                            course of action with regard to putting forward the 4-point resolution
                            in upcoming consultations and at Bournemouth. He explained that he had
                            put the resolution on the table and that it contained criteria which
                            would establish a link between special permits and a comprehensive
                            assessment. He reiterated comments the day before to the effect that he
                            did not think it possible to get the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> to focus on a comprehensive assessment until the issue
                            of special permits had been resolved. At the same time, he agreed that
                            Iceland’s activities also stimulated movement toward a comprehensive
                            assessment. He thought it a mistake, therefore, to conclude that the
                            U.S. had agreed to shelve its proposal. In fact this option had been
                            rejected some while back and he had no choice but to push forward with
                            the proposal. The conversation then turned to Eiriksson’s concern about
                            the intent of the U.S. resolution. Was it not, in fact, aimed at
                            Iceland, he asked. The imminent departure of Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>’s flight prevented any further
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>16. Prior to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>’s arrival
                            at the airport and the March 7 last minute meeting, he attended a
                            briefing by <gloss target="#t_IDF_1">IDF</gloss> personnel on U.S.
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Base Operations. Finally, we
                            provide below text of Ministry of Fisheries March 7 press release, text
                            of which had been agreed upon by both sides the day before.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Anthony J. Calio</persName>, Under
                            Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, concluded on March 6 an
                            official visit to Iceland, the purpose of which was to gather
                            information on marine research and fisheries management as carried out
                            by the Government of Iceland. He was here at the invitation of Minister
                            of Fisheries Halldor Asgrimsson. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> was accompanied by Assistant Administrator of the

                            officials exchanged information with scientists from the Marine Research
                            Institute as well as experts from the Ministry of Fisheries relative to
                            Iceland’s recent experience in Fisheries Management and Stock
                            Assessment. Consultations included a visit to the Westman Islands where
                            they observed, among other things, the processing of capelin roe for
                            export. <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss> officials were <pb
                                facs="0964" n="918" xml:id="pg_918"/> also interested in estimates
                            of cod production in 1987. The shrimp fishery and future prospects for
                            clam production in Iceland.</p>
                        <p>Given the central role that <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss> plays
                            in carrying out the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of
                            1976, legislation requiring the U.S. Government to prevent overfishing
                            and conserve resources, the delegation sought to profit by Iceland’s
                            experience in fisheries management. Officials also discussed ways in
                            which the United States and Iceland can promote and increase their
                            cooperation in the field of fisheries and fisheries research.</p>
                        <p>Both sides also consulted on whaling matters as they pertain to their
                            mutual membership in the International Whaling Commission. They
                            discussed the possibility of increased cooperation in comprehensively
                            assessing whale stocks, including those of special interest to
                            Iceland.</p>

                        <p>On April 21 and April 24, 1987, a delegation consisting of <persName

                                >Evans</persName> met with Dr. V. Zilanov, Head of the Department

                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. Several times during our meetings,
                            I stated that discussions of allocations for <pb facs="0965" n="919"
                                xml:id="pg_919"/> direct take in the U.S. exclusive economic zone
                            were not possible until the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            removed its objection to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            moratorium on commercial whaling. Zilanov’s response was that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> did not have a problem since they
                            ceased all commercial whaling in 1987. They did not find it necessary to
                            remove the objection. This gesture would be purely academic since they
                            were no longer whaling. During the latter part of the April 24th
                            meeting, both <persName corresp="#p_WEE_1">Ed Wolfe</persName> and I
                            told Zilanov that his answers on the whaling issue were not
                            satisfactory. Further discussion on renewal of the present governing
                            international fishery agreement (<gloss target="#t_GIFA_1"
                            >GIFA</gloss>), a reverse <gloss target="#t_GIFA_1">GIFA</gloss> or any
                            other type of bilateral agreement would not be productive. Dr. Zilanov
                            presented copies of two articles which stated the Soviet point of view
                            (see attached).<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">Not attached.</note> His
                            final statement during the remainder of the formal meetings was that
                            these articles stated the Soviet view clearly. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WEE_1">Ed Wolfe</persName> and I said thank you and
                            indicated there was little more to discuss if this was the Soviet final
                            position.</p>
                        <p>On April 25, at the airport just prior to our departure, Dr. Zilanov
                            asked to talk with me in private. He stated the following:</p>
                        <quote><p>• The Soviet decision to cease all whaling except aboriginal was
                                made at the “highest level,” above the Minister of Fisheries.
                                Participation in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> was a
                                sensitive issue.</p>
                            <p>• Many senior scientists with the Academy are opposed to commercial
                                whaling. This is especially true within the Commission on the
                                Protection of Nature, currently chaired by Professor Alexey
                                Yablokov.</p>
                            <p>• The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was supportive of all
                                aspect of the moratorium, but their lawyers have convinced them it
                                is illegal, since it was not a recommendation based on advice of the
                                Scientific Committee. This makes it impossible for them to withdraw
                                their objection formally.</p>
                            <p>• He requested that we write a letter to Commissioner Nikonorov
                                asking for more detail on the Soviet cessation of whaling. This
                                would allow them to provide a response which might make it possible
                                for us to remove our certification.</p>
                            <p>• He stated that we may also wish to enclose a copy of the U.S.
                                resolution, with explanation under the same cover.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>At the end of the conversation he informed me that Commissioner Nikonorov
                            was being assigned as a deputy to Professor Alexey Yablokov. It was
                            unlikely that he would remain the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            Commissioner to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> beyond
                            1987.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_WEE_1">Ed Wolfe</persName> was not present
                            during the private conversation with Dr. Zilanov, he has relayed some of
                            the Soviet response to Bob Eisenbud. Bob called and expressed some
                            concerns about any exchange of letters with the Soviets. He did not
                            elaborate but did state a desire to discuss the implications of such a
                            change with both you <pb facs="0966" n="920" xml:id="pg_920"/> and me.
                            As was mentioned in the meeting on Dall’s porpoise in your office May
                            11, Dan McGovern has also talked with Bob Eisenbud.</p>
                        <p>As per our discussion, I will draft a letter to Dr. Zilanov transmitting
                            a copy of your Resolutions on Scientific Whaling Permits.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d327fn3">Not found.</note> I will also ask for some
                            clarification on <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> cessation of
                            whaling, since the attached articles do not give specifics. I will also
                            thank him for his hospitality.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your letter of May 11 concerning the United States proposed

                            respect and good will that have long characterized our relations.
                            Iceland is a close friend and longstanding ally, whose views and
                            cooperation we value. It is on the basis of our strong bilateral
                            relationship that we try to find mutually acceptable solutions to the
                            inevitable differences of opinion that can arise—even between close
                            friends. It is this spirit of friendship and understanding that I hope
                            can guide both of our efforts to find a solution to the scientific
                            whaling issue.</p>

                        <p>Because we so highly value our friendship with Iceland, we have made
                            exceptional efforts to consult fully and frequently with your government
                            on this difficult issue. These consultations began last year when the

                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> and Minister

                                >IWC</gloss> last year.<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">See <ref

                            It should be noted that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> has not been able to afford the time to visit any
                            other country for the sole purpose of consulting on the proposed
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>I regret that you interpret our efforts to establish within the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> an objective evaluation and review
                            system for scientific whaling as “an aggressive policy against a
                            legitimate and well founded Icelandic research program,” or that you
                            believe it “reflects a disregard for the will and well being of the
                            Icelandic people.” Our proposed resolution is intended to reduce the
                            possibility of abuses under the present scientific whaling system. It is
                            not directed at the program of any nation. We do not contemplate or
                            intend that our resolution, or any action by the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, would rule out the taking of whales
                            for recognized scientific research purposes. The United States is not
                            insensitive to Iceland’s legitimate research interests. For instance,
                            when Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> was in Reykjavik
                            he offered to provide substantial support—up to eight scientists and
                            research vessels—for Iceland’s whale-sighting survey, which constitutes
                            one part of your country’s scientific research program.</p>
                        <p>It is in our common interest to work together in the <gloss

                            whaling in a cooperative spirit. At this stage, we believe we cannot
                            withdraw the proposed resolution as you suggest. However, we are
                            prepared to engage in meaningful and constructive dialogue with Iceland,
                            prior to and during the meeting, to develop mutually agreeable changes
                            to the resolution, which we would support. Thus, I urge you to provide
                            us with your specific comments on the proposed resolution at the
                            earliest possible time.<note n="5" xml:id="d328fn5">In telegram 1200

                        <p>1. Confidential—Entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. The following is approved text of memorandum of conversation of
                            Secretary’s meeting with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MMA_1"
                                >Mathiesen</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Summary: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName> held
                            a bilateral discussion on the margins of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting with Icelandic Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MMA_1">Matthias Mathiesen</persName> and
                            Fisheries Minister Halldor Asgrimsson. As expected, the talks centered
                            almost exclusively on scientific whaling and the upcoming International
                            Whaling Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) meeting at
                            Bournemouth, U.K. The Secretary began the conversation by noting that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would not be able to meet
                            Iceland’s request for a bilateral agreement prior to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting guaranteeing that we would not
                            certify Iceland under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>

                            desire to see Iceland introduce its draft resolution on scientific
                            whaling or formally table amendments to ours at Bournemouth.
                            Surprisingly, the Icelanders did not press the Secretary on this issue,
                            but rather sought assurances that if they did so, their points would be
                            taken seriously. The Secretary responded that Dr. <persName

                            discussions with Iceland. He added that we expect to continue
                            discussions both during and after the Bournemouth meeting and that no
                                <pb facs="0969" n="923" xml:id="pg_923"/> decisions would be taken
                            on certification without full bilateral consultations. No matter what
                            final outcome emerges from the meeting.<note n="3" xml:id="d329fn3">An

                        <p>There was a brief discussion of Iceland’s desire to have increased
                            flights between Reykjavik and Orlando. The Secretary replied that we

                                >NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting. Also participating for Iceland
                            were: Hannes Hafstein, Permanent Under Secretary of the Ministry of

                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Arni Kolbeinsson, Secretary General,
                            Ministry of Fisheries. Accompanying the Secretary were: Assistant

                        <p>5. The Secretary began the meeting by thanking the Icelanders for the

                            outstanding example of Icelandic hospitality, hard work and efficiency.
                            The Secretary added that when the history of this period is written, the
                            name of Reykjavik will be closely identified with important steps
                            forward in arms control.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_MMA_1">Mathiesen</persName> began the
                            substantive discussion by referring to the Secretary’s letter<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d329fn5">In telegram 178511 to Beijing, June 15, the
                                Department transmitted the text of a version of the letter, but the
                                text was garbled. (Department of State, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D870470–0249)</note> which he had received the previous evening and
                            asking if the Secretary would care to provide additional comment. In
                            response, the Secretary reiterated the points made in the letter—we
                            strongly urge that Iceland go to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> meeting prepared to table its draft resolution on
                            whaling or formally introduce amendments to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> draft resolution. This will be the only means by which
                            a full debate on the issues can be held. When the results are in, we can
                            take stock and decide if any further discussions or steps are warranted.
                            He added that he recognized the Icelandic desire for a bilateral
                            agreement prior to the commissioners meeting, but we must be careful not
                            to <pb facs="0970" n="924" xml:id="pg_924"/> preempt the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting. Such an agreement could cause
                            serious problems for the Secretary of Commerce with Congress.<note n="6"

                        <p>7. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRL_1">Ridgway</persName>
                            seconded the statement made by the Secretary and added that it was
                            important for us that both sides of the issue be presented at
                            Bournemouth. Only by presenting its case can Iceland hope to have a
                            final outcome that meets its needs. In reply, Fisheries Minister
                            Asgrimsson agreed that Iceland would also prefer to work within existing
                            international bodies such as the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> to
                            resolve differences. However, Iceland believes that the U.S. draft
                            resolution will be passed to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> no
                            matter what Iceland does or does not do since our influence is so
                            strong. Before engaging in an effort to win approval for its draft
                            resolution or proposing amendments to ours, the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> would like to be assured that its proposals will be
                            taken seriously by the U.S. If Iceland is going to compromise a
                            principle that it holds strongly, i.e., the right of <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> states to issue special permits for
                            scientific whaling without involvement of the Commission, as provided
                            for under Article 8 of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            convention, then it would like to be assured that the final result will
                            be acceptable.<note n="7" xml:id="d329fn7">An unknown hand bracketed
                                this sentence and drew an asterisk to the right of it.</note>
                            Asgrimsson repeated the well-established <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> position that the U.S. draft resolution would give the
                            Commission a responsibility not justified under the convention. Such a
                            step would lead to “politicization” of scientific research and be
                            dangerous for the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s future.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary responded that he is not familiar with the working of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, but he assumed that like most
                            similar international organizations, members spanned the spectrum from
                            the serious and well-informed to fanatics. Nevertheless, it is useful
                            and essential to work through the process. He would be surprised if the

                        <p>9. Agrimsson explained that Iceland, like the U.S. was not happy with the

                            However, the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> had agreed to it, on
                            the understanding that the issue was resolved at least through 1990

                            that the U.S. will not again raise the question of certification and
                            trade sanctions, as happened during last year’s bilateral confrontation
                            over scientific whaling. The Secretary assured <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMA_1">Mathiesen</persName> that before any decision was
                            taken on certification, we would consult fully with the <gloss

                        <p>11. Just prior to the conclusion of the meeting, <persName

                            asked to raise the question of additional flights to Orlando, Florida,
                            for Icelandair. The route has been very successful and Icelandair would
                            like to move from three flights per week to five. The Secretary noted
                            that he had worked a number of civil aviation issues with the <gloss

                        <p>A recent resolution by the International Whaling Commission (<gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) bans any killing of whales by
                            Iceland. Lawyers at the Department of Commerce assert that if Iceland
                            does not adhere to the resolution, the Secretary of Commerce is required
                            under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment to
                            “certify” Iceland in contravention of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> resolution. Indeed, some at Commerce believe that the
                            Secretary is already obligated to certify Iceland because of whaling
                            practices.</p>
                        <p>Given the importance of trade (mostly fish) with the US, even
                            certification represents, in the Icelandic view, a highly threatening
                            measure and could harm our security interests there. We recommend you
                            discuss the issue with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1"
                                >Baldrige</persName> and emphasize the importance of finding
                            acceptable alternatives to certification (talking points are

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> was formed in 1937 to monitor
                            rapidly dwindling whale stocks. Over the years the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> has become a force for preserving
                            whale stocks and includes contracting parties from both whaling and
                            non-whaling countries. In 1982, the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            passed a resolution placing a moratorium on all commercial whaling, but
                            it reserved the right of nations to engage in scientific whaling. In
                            response to this moratorium the Icelanders reduced their whale kill from
                            roughly 400/yr to 120/yr.</p>
                        <p>Although whaling is not important to the Icelandic economy, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> insists that the current take of 120
                            whales is essential to make a determination on the implications for
                            Iceland’s fishing industry, far and away the most important sector in
                            their economy. “Scientific whaling,” if it meets <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> criteria, is permitted under the
                            convention. The Icelanders argue, with some merit, that whales compete
                            for the same feedstock as the commercial fishstocks. They do not wish to
                            stop their whaling program until the research indicates their fishstock
                            population will not be harmed.</p>
                        <p>The Icelanders take Fin and Sei whales, neither of which are on the
                            endangered or threatened list. The recent <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> meetings determined that the Icelandic scientific
                            whaling program no longer met the appropriate criteria for acceptable
                            whaling. Should the Icelanders continue to kill whales (under their
                            scientific program), the Secretary of Commerce is required to certify
                            them in contravention of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, a
                            legal requirement under U.S. law. Once certification occurs, the
                            President must decide whether to impose trade sanctions. We would
                            recommend against putting the President in a position of deciding
                            between whales and our security interests in Iceland.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Steps</p>
                        <p>There are some steps we can take to keep this issue from getting out of
                            control. Clearly, part of the concern with the Icelanders is the issue
                            of sovereignty. The Icelanders see the U.S. as threatening them on an
                            issue which they believe is none of our business. If they continue
                            whaling, <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Mac Baldrige</persName> believes
                            he has no choice but to certify Iceland. We do not agree. We believe the
                            Secretary of Commerce has discretion <pb facs="0974" n="928"
                                xml:id="pg_928"/> both from a policy and legal perspective. For
                            example, we could open consultations with the Icelanders to examine
                            proposals for augmenting their scientific program in a manner that would
                            be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> (i.e., they
                            could continue taking whales but under a more rigorous scientific
                            protocol). With our help, the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> might
                            approve a new scientific program and we would avoid certification.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d330fn5">An unknown hand underlined the previous two
                                sentences and wrote in the left-hand margin: “Work with

                                approval.”</note> Other alternatives also exist. There is precedent
                            for not certifying Iceland. The Supreme Court recently upheld a decision
                            by the Secretary of Commerce not to certify Japan for violating the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. Commerce, however, argues that
                            Iceland’s violations are so egregious as to require certification.</p>

                            may escalate the problem with Iceland to the point where our options are

                            <salute>Dear Mac:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>(C) I am writing to express my strong interest in the imminent
                            negotiations with the Government of Iceland on the issue of scientific
                            whaling, and my concern that a rigid US position could undermine
                            important security arrangements.</p>
                        <p>(S) As you know, the US base at Keflavik, Iceland, is of vital importance
                            to US and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> security. Its
                            geographical location makes Keflavik the linchpin of our efforts to
                            defend our North Atlantic sea lines of communication between North
                            America and Europe, as well as an invaluable forward position for the
                            defense of the US. Without unhampered ability to operate US air and
                            naval forces from Keflavik, we would be very hard-pressed to reinforce
                            Western Europe in crisis or war, and to defend the US from Soviet
                            nuclear ballistic missile submarines in the Atlantic Ocean. Even in
                            peacetime, Keflavik is an unrivalled location for daily surveillance and
                            monitoring of Soviet air and naval activity in the Atlantic. It would be
                            extremely difficult to conduct these operations from any other possible
                            location.</p>
                        <p>(C) At present we are able to use this facility on favorable terms and
                            without paying any base rent. Our cooperation with the last Icelandic
                            Government was among the very best we have had, and great progress was
                            made to modernize and improve our defense posture at Keflavik. Under
                            normal circumstances, the new Icelandic government would be likely to
                            continue along the same lines.</p>
                        <p>(C) I am concerned now, however, that our position in Keflavik, our
                            freedom of operations there, and perhaps even our presence itself, may
                            be jeopardized if we pursue inflexible positions with Iceland on
                            scientific whaling. While clearly we want Iceland to bring its program
                            into conformity with International Whaling Commission (<gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) regulations, I hope that we can be
                            flexible in the ways that we pursue this goal, and give the Icelanders
                            the opportunity to work with us rather than present them with ultimata
                            that may force them to choose between sacrificing their national dignity
                            or being certified under the Pelley Amendment. Based upon the history of
                            the very difficult US-Icelandic Rainbow shipping controversy between
                            1984 and 1987,<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">See <ref target="#d324fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 324</ref>.</note> I would expect the
                            Icelanders to harden rather than sacrifice their national dignity, at
                                <pb facs="0976" n="930" xml:id="pg_930"/> considerable expense to
                            friendly bilateral relations now and in the future.</p>
                        <p>(S) At risk is the US base at Keflavik, as that is the only lever that
                            Iceland can use to apply pressure upon the US. The result could be
                            serious damage to US defense, and the loss of a most important Ally,
                            without achieving our objectives with regard to whaling.</p>
                        <p>(C) DoD has previously expressed its concern about this situation to the
                            Departments of Commerce and State, and to the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss>. I would be glad to discuss it with you at your

                        <p>In Iceland’s view this dispute is also a question of national
                            sovereignty. No Icelandic government, especially one that has just taken
                            office, can be seen allowing itself to be “dictated to” by the <gloss

                        <p>Fisheries issues in Iceland are considered a question of national
                            security. In previous bilateral disputes, Icelandic governments have not
                            hesitated to use the presence of the base and US forces at Keflavik as
                            leverage. The <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> fully understands

                        <p>As an alternative to certification, Commerce has suggested a brief
                            package of points for discussion with Iceland that would, inter alia,
                            allow Iceland to continue scientific whaling, albeit at a reduced level
                                <pb facs="0978" n="932" xml:id="pg_932"/> for the remainder of the

                            Iceland resubmit a revised scientific research program in 1988 to the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> for consideration if it wishes
                            to continue research whaling and agree to abide by the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Although we support the thrust of Commerce’s position, the terms of
                            discussion need to be modified if we are to have a realistic chance of
                            resolving this matter and diminishing the likelihood of a bilateral
                            crisis. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1">Baldrige</persName> takes
                            the position that unless Iceland agrees quickly to this offer, as
                            presented, certification will follow immediately after the talks
                            conclude. We find this totally unacceptable. If the US enters bilateral
                            talks with that position, these talks can not reasonably be construed as
                            the “meaningful consultations” you promised to then Foreign Minister

                        <p>Three points need to be conveyed to Secretary <persName

                        <p>—The negotations must be undertaken in good faith. There may be other
                            ways to accomplish our goal of seeing that the effectiveness of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> or its conservation program is
                            not reduced.</p>
                        <p>—The US should be prepared to participate in scientific consultations
                            with Iceland on how its program can be redesigned to meet <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> criteria in an appropriate manner.</p>
                        <p>—No decision should be made on certification until after bilateral
                            discussions have taken place and there is a chance to assess the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese and other governments will see an accommodation with Iceland
                            as a precedent and are likely to seek equivalent agreements, therefore,
                            discussions with Iceland must be viewed in this context.</p>

                                <salute>Dear Mac:</salute>
                            </opener>
                            <p>As you are aware, plans are underway for discussions in the very near
                                future between the United States and Iceland on the decisions taken
                                by the International Whaling Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                    >IWC</gloss>) at its recently concluded annual meeting in
                                Bournemouth. For Iceland the most important result was an <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> assessment that its scientific
                                research program did not meet existing <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                    >IWC</gloss> criteria. A recommendation by the Commission urged
                                that Iceland halt its scientific whaling until uncertainties
                                identified by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific
                                Committee are resolved.</p>
                            <p>Based on the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> decisions and
                                Iceland’s continued research whaling there is, I understand, strong
                                sentiment among some environmental organizations for you to certify
                                Iceland under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                                and/or <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName> Amendments.
                                Clearly, that is one way of bringing pressure on Iceland to cease
                                scientific whaling until its program accords with <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> criteria. A certification of
                                Iceland may not be the best way to ensure the effectiveness of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and its conservation
                                program.</p>
                            <p>I think our agreement to offer discussions to Iceland before you make
                                a decision on certification is sound. It is consistent with past US
                                practice as well as the commitments I made to the Icelandic Foreign
                                Minister. We want to continue working with <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1"
                                    >NOAA</gloss> to assure that these discussions are meaningful
                                and result in progress towards our goal of assuring that research
                                whaling is scientifically valid and not used as a cover for
                                commercial activity.</p>
                            <p>On behalf of the Department of Commerce, <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1"
                                    >NOAA</gloss> outlined for us steps that could be proposed to
                                Iceland to bring it into compliance with <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                    >IWC</gloss> recommendations. In essence, they are that Iceland
                                agree to limit its scientific whaling to no more than 80 whales this
                                year and agree to be bound by <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                                recommendations on scientific whaling starting in 1988. This would
                                be in the best interests of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                                conservation program. Commerce would also maintain its present
                                position that Japan not be certified if it purchases no more than
                                49% of whale meat and by-products taken by Iceland under these
                                special permits.</p>
                            <p>I think that this package forms an adequate basis to begin
                                consultations. However, I am concerned about two aspects of the
                                terms of <pb facs="0980" n="934" xml:id="pg_934"/> reference for
                                these talks. The first is the view that Iceland must accept the
                                Commerce proposal as presented below or certification will
                                immediately result. There may be other, equally valid ways to
                                achieve the same ends. It is important that we listen to Iceland’s
                                position and be prepared to consider alternatives that are
                                consistent with our objectives of seeing that the effectiveness of
                                the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and its conservation
                                program are not reduced.</p>
                            <p>The second area I find troubling is the lack of discussions on
                                Iceland’s scientific research program. In my May 22 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">21</hi>] letter to Foreign Minister <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MMA_1">Mathiesen</persName>, sent with USDOC
                                clearance, I stated that our draft resolution (since adopted by the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) was not intended to
                                prohibit scientific whaling but rather to prevent possible abuses
                                and to assure that it was conducted only for valid scientific
                                    reasons.<note n="8" xml:id="d332fn8">See <ref target="#d328"
                                        >Document 328</ref>.</note> I would like to see us take
                                steps to help Iceland’s program meet those goals.</p>
                            <p>In the past, <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss> was reluctant to
                                provide a scientific assessment to Iceland on a bilateral basis,
                                arguing that this task should properly be done by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee. At this
                                year’s meeting the Scientific Committee reviewed the results of
                                Iceland’s first year of scientific whaling and found the program
                                flawed—a conclusion we helped shape and continue to share. Now that
                                the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> has spoken, I would think
                                that <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss>’s inhibition about
                                scientific discussions with Iceland could be reconsidered.</p>
                            <p>I think that it would be in our interest to work with Iceland to
                                assure that its scientific research program meets <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> standards. A quality program would
                                contribute to the comprehensive assessment and help support our own
                                conservation goals. Furthermore, US advice in designing a research
                                program that could win <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> approval
                                is a strong incentive for Iceland to remain in the organization.
                                Iceland’s withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>,
                                a real possibility in the wake of the recent Bournemouth decisions
                                or a US decision to certify, surely would not serve our conservation
                                objectives.</p>
                            <p>Finally, there is the question of dealing with the outcome of the
                                discussions. I think it is essential that we have a chance to assess
                                the results and take stock. Also, a new government has just taken
                                office in Iceland and will need a reasonable amount of time to
                                decide its policy and consult Parliament. I know you are aware of
                                the important issues at stake and the need to proceed
                                cautiously.</p>
                            <p>Although the dates of the discussions have not yet been set, we
                                expect them to take place perhaps as early as this week or shortly
                                thereafter. For this reason, I look forward to receiving your views
                                at your earliest convenience.</p>

                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment. The head of the <gloss

                            Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. Halldor Asgrimsson, Minister of
                            Fisheries, headed the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> delegation.

                        <p>The main body of the delegations met in the morning of July 21 and in the
                            morning and afternoon of July 22. A meeting addressing scientific
                            aspects of <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s whale research program
                            was held in the afternoon of July 21.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">MORNING MEETING, JULY 21, 1987</p>
                        <p>Halldor Asgrimsson opened the discussions by noting that there is a new
                            government recently elected in Iceland. One of the purposes of the
                            discussions is to ascertain the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            position regarding certification in order to present that position to
                            the new government. Before <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> can
                            commit to any position concerning the taking of whales in a research
                            program, there must be support from all parties in the newly elected
                            parliament. Because of this, Asgrimsson stated that it would be
                            necessary to meet further with <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            after presenting the results of these meetings to the new government. He
                            declared that the pause in the taking of whales would continue until all
                            discussions had been completed.</p>
                        <p>Asgrimsson then offered a brief background of <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss>’s whaling research program. He described <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s decision to intensify its whaling
                            research program since <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s moratorium
                            on commercial whaling. Presently, eight ships involved in whale research
                            are deployed from Norway to Greenland, and almost all of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s whale scientists are involved in
                            this research. In light of this intensified research effort, <pb
                                facs="0982" n="936" xml:id="pg_936"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> was very unhappy with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> resolution against its research
                            program.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Anthony Calio</persName> responded in his
                            opening remarks that he understood <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                            >GOI</gloss>’s need to report back to the new government before any
                            definitive decisions are made and that he agreed to continue the
                            meetings at a future date. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> expressed the desire that at the end of these
                            meeting both sides should be clear on where they stood and what should
                            be done in the interim.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> acknowledged <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s pause in taking of whales and
                            indicated that as long as the pause was in effect and that discussions
                            between the two countries continued, DOC would not certify <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>. But <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> stated that if <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> decided not to abide by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> resolution against Iceland’s research program by taking
                            additional whales, then Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BMH_1"
                                >Baldrige</persName> would have no alternative under U.S. law other
                            than certification. If <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> abides by
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> resolution and takes no
                            additional whales, then certification can be avoided.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> explained that an
                            important reason for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s resolution
                            concerning scientific criteria at the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> meeting was to avoid the need to make an independent
                            judgment regarding the compliance of scientific whaling programs of
                            other countries to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> conservation
                            program. He stressed <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> policy that it
                            is not necessary to kill whales for research.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> stated that the overall philosophy
                            of its research program was to determine the ecosystem impact of whales
                            in Icelandic waters. Asgrimsson specifically said that whaling is not
                            the important factor; rather, the effect of whales on the ecosystem is
                            the primary concern of the research. In this regard, he stated that
                            whales are eating 4% of the food in Icelandic waters, and this is a
                            significant factor to a country so dependent on the ocean.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> then explained why it did not abide
                            by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> resolution stressing that it
                            was vague as to scientific criteria it should follow and that it was
                            only a majority expression of scientists who have differing views.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> desires to avoid the taking of
                            whales where possible.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> responded that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> resolution taken in context of the
                            whole record was sufficiently clear in setting forth criteria <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> should be following. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stated that it has no desire to
                            discuss the scientific aspects of the resolution except within <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> guidelines. <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> made clear its position that it will not intervene on
                            behalf of <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> to justify the taking of whales in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Both sides agreed that it would be useful to clarify the scientific
                            differences between the two countries concerning the taking of whales
                            under the resolution. It was agreed that delegates representing
                            scientific interests would meet in the afternoon to discuss the meaning
                            of compre<pb facs="0983" n="937" xml:id="pg_937"/>hensive assessment,
                            the objectives of <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s research, the
                            need to use lethal research techniques, experiment designs, sampling
                            plans, and adverse effects of research on whale populations.</p>
                        <p>A discussion followed concerning the difference in philosophical
                            approaches of the two countries in undertaking research on whales.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> emphasized its multi-species,
                            ecosystem approach. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> expressed its
                            understanding of this approach and sympathy to it, but stressed that
                            DOC’s decision about certification is guided in large measure by
                            findings of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> attempted to convince <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> that in a certification decision,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should make an independent
                            decision concerning violation of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> and not be bound by the resolution. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> answered that it was not bound by the
                            decision but it nevertheless deferred to it until <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> can resolve discrepancies between its
                            behavior and the requirements of the resolution.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> shifted discussion to the
                            certification process and its implications. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> expressed confusion concerning DOC’s role in certifying
                            and the President’s role in imposing sanctions. <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> explained DOC’s certification decision is totally
                            separate from the President’s decision to impose sanctions. Examples of
                            certifications involving other countries such as Japan, Korea, Norway
                            and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> were cited.<note n="3"

                            <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> emphasized that certification under
                            the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment does not
                            automatically result in any direct economic sanctions but can result in
                            indirect economic effects if for example Iceland sold whale meat to
                            Japan. In that case Japan could be certified and economic sanctions
                            imposed on Japan.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> was interested in whether DOC would
                            recommend sanctions in conjunction with a certification. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> assured <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> that recommendations are not a part of the
                            certification process, but DOC is free to recommend or not recommend
                            sanctions or do nothing at all. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> at this point stated that <gloss
                                target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss> would probably recommend no
                            sanctions against <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> if it is

                            asked for questions. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> desired
                            clarification about the use of the terms “some or all” in the first and
                            last bullets of page 2 because the wording seemed to indicate that the
                            President’s only options were between prohibiting <hi rend="italic"
                                >some</hi> or <hi rend="italic">all</hi> fish products. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> was assured that the President had
                            discretion not to impose any prohibitions and that “some or all” should
                            be replaced by “any.”</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> also asked about the use of the term
                            “unlimited discretion” in the second bullet on page 2 since the

                                >USG</gloss> responded that the President can only exercise
                            discretion within legal limits and that this was implied. It was
                            suggested that “unlimited” should be replaced by “wide” to avoid any

                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> inquired about the reasons the

                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> explained that the President will not
                            say sanctions should not be imposed because DOC recommended it but
                            rather will give substantive reasons.</p>

                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment certifications of other countries. An

                            which summarized this history.<note n="5" xml:id="d333fn5">Not

                        <p>After this review, <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> asked whether a
                            certification of Iceland would be the first one based on a violation of
                            a resolution as opposed to the Convention or Schedule. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> expressed its belief that it would be
                            the first time, noting, however, that certification had been considered
                            in the late 1970’s in relation to repeated <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> resolutions urging member countries not to import whale
                            meat from non-members. In that instance, the problem was resolved
                            without resort to certification. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            emphasized that a certification based on the violation of a resolution
                            is in keeping with <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            Amendment language which refers to diminishing the effectiveness of a
                            conservation “program.” <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>’s
                            interpretation of the term “program” is that it includes all elements of
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> actions and is not confined to
                            the Convention or the Schedule. When asked if there are any affirmative
                            statements to this effect in legal documents, <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> offered to research the matter and pass on its

                            <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> wanted to know if the President’s
                            decision not to sanction Norway was based on Norway’s decision to abide
                            by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, and if the President’s
                            decisions not to sanction in other cases were likewise based on the

                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> responded that it believed this
                            has always been the case although the President is not required by law
                            to base a no sanction decision on the certified country’s remedial
                            actions. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stated that a primary

                            is to influence certified countries to cease their objectionable

                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> then asked that if a certified

                            decide not to impose sanctions. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            responded that hypothetically this is possible, but it would be
                            presumptuous to speak for the President.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> explained about the continuing
                            nature of a certification and the formal requirement of

                        <p>After a break, the delegates reconvened and the first topic introduced by
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was a report from the preceding
                            afternoon’s scientific meeting. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">William
                                Evans</persName>, Assistant Administrator of Fisheries, <gloss
                                target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss>, briefly reviewed major points of
                            the meeting emphasizing <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName>’s
                            charge to explore <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s justification
                            of lethal techniques and the differences in philosophical approaches
                            between the two country’s scientific programs regarding whales.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> then called on Michael
                            Tillman, Office of Protected Resources, <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1"
                                >NOAA</gloss>, to summarize in more detail the results of the
                            meeting. Tillman characterized the meeting as involving broad
                            discussions that were very useful. He stressed that both sides explored
                            philosophical differences in scientific research on whales. U.S. law
                            allows the killing of whales for purposes of scientific research, but
                                <pb facs="0986" n="940" xml:id="pg_940"/> only after setting forth a
                            carefully prepared rationale that considers population size and trends,
                            sample size, and impact on the population. This approach is then carried
                            over in implementing U.S. policies and objectives at HWB. Tillman stated
                            that one of the biggest problems with <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss>’s scientific approach is its failure to offer an
                            adequate rational for its proposed killings. According to Tillman,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> scientists are satisfied that
                            non-lethal techniques could be substituted for lethal techniques. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> recognizes that non-lethal techniques
                            may be more time consuming and costly, but such an approach is
                            preferable to <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s approach and more
                            in keeping with <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> requirements.</p>
                        <p>Tillman also recognized an understanding from the meeting that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> was combining lethal and non-lethal
                            techniques in order to precipitate the collection of data so as to meet
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> 1990 date for “undertaking” a
                            comprehensive assessment of whale populations.<note n="9"

                                >USG</gloss> does not interpret use of the term “undertake” to mean

                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>. It is <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>’s interpretation that “undertake” means that the

                            explanation of it is that <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> is under
                            a tighter timeframe than <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in
                            collecting data for the 1990 comprehensive assessment and that this
                            timeframe does not allow use of non-lethal techniques in all instances
                            because such techniques are too costly and time consuming.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stated that its approach to whale
                            research is conditioned by the requirements and limitations of the
                            Marine Mammal Protection Act (<gloss target="#t_MMPA_1">MMPA</gloss>)
                            which requires permits for any taking of whales including <pb
                                facs="0987" n="941" xml:id="pg_941"/> harassment. If the use of
                            non-lethal techniques is more time consuming and costly but will yield
                            the same results as lethal techniques, then, according to <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> philosophy, the non-lethal techniques
                            must generally be developed and used.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> emphasized its interpretation of the
                            1990 date for the comprehensive assessment as only the beginning of what
                            is necessarily a long process due to the need to analyze environmental
                            changes and their biological effects on whales.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> reiterated its justification for a
                            combined use of non-lethal and lethal techniques based on its
                            intensified attempt to collect as much data as possible before 1990. The
                            statement was made that this approach does not diminish the
                            effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> but does the
                            opposite because <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> is interested in
                            finding out as much as possible about whales.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s scientist, Johann Sigurjonsson,
                            participated in this portion of the discussions and gave his assessment
                            of the scientific meeting of the previous day. He expressed that his
                            understanding of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position
                            regarding justified killing of whales was that there must be an adequate
                            understanding of the the state of the stock, the whale must not be
                            endangered, only the minimum possible take will occur, and non-lethal
                            means must be used as much as possible. Sigurjonsson said that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> had clearly shown that these
                            prerequisites had been met in <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s
                            research proposals. He stated that lethal takes are necessary in an
                            ecosystem approach and that for some scientific inquiries there is no
                            non-lethal technique available.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stated that it is not opposed to the
                            ecosystem approach and in fact has adopted such an approach for its
                            National Marine Fisheries Service. However, other constraints of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and Marine Mammal Protections
                            Act do not permit the type of lethal takings <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> is pursuing.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> suggested that the meeting break and
                            reconvene in the afternoon to summarize the discussions and make plans
                            for future discussions. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> agreed and
                            expressed the desire to jointly draft a brief, general press release in
                            the afternoon meeting.<note n="11" xml:id="d333fn11">In telegram 227373

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> initiated this session of
                            the meetings by stating that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had
                            tried to answer the preceding day’s questions concerning the
                            certification process. He stated that he felt both sides had reached an
                            understanding about their different backgrounds and approaches
                            concerning whale research. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1"
                                >Calio</persName> expressed his understanding that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> must now go back to Iceland to present
                            the results of these meetings, and that he assumed <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> will meet again with <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to discuss <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss>’s intentions for the rest of the year and in the future
                            regarding the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> recommendations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> stated that as long
                            as future discussions are planned and <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> does not take any more whales, then DOC can probably
                            hold its position not to certify for one month to 5 weeks.</p>
                        <p>Asgrimsson committed to continue the pause in whaling until consultations
                            are over. He stated that the delegation will return to Iceland to
                            present the results of the meetings. He expressed <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s desire to have good relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, but he said that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> also wants to have the freedom to
                            conduct research as it sees fit in its own waters. This freedom to
                            conduct research, according to Asgrimsson, is the most important aspect
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s concerns because Iceland is
                            living off its waters. Therefore, the necessary decisions will be
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> echoed <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s desire to continue good relations
                            with each other and committed the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            not to do anything precipitous to affect this relationship. But <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will eventually have to do something
                            by law if it has to in reaction to <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                            >GOI</gloss>’s whale research.</p>
                        <p>At this time, selected members of the two delegations met to draft a
                            press release which is attached hereto as document I.<note n="13"

                            would be prepared to go to Iceland for them, if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Asgrimsson said the next meetings would be arranged through the two

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">William Evans</persName> opened the
                            discussion with a background of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            philosophical approach to whale research. He discussed the requirements
                            of the <gloss target="#t_MMPA_1">MMPA</gloss> and how this act
                            determines the conditions under which permits for the taking of whales
                            are issued. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> stressed the
                            need under U.S. law to have an adequate assessment of a stock before any
                            takings are allowed. He referenced the Marine Mammal Commission report
                            concerning <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s research proposal and
                            the report’s conclusion that <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> had
                            not adequately assessed the stocks from which it was proposing to take
                            whales.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> recognized the need to
                            study the ecosystem effect of whales and to some degree <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is sympathetic to this approach.
                            However, he pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is
                            proscribed legally by the <gloss target="#t_MMPA_1">MMPA</gloss> from
                            utilizing lethal techniques in many research applications.</p>
                        <p>In response to <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s question about the
                            motivation of the <gloss target="#t_MMPA_1">MMPA</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> stated that the Act was not just
                            an environmental statement but it represented a valid scientific shift
                            to the need to carefully assess the impact of research and interaction
                            with marine mammals.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> put forth some of its justifications
                            for the lethal taking of whales. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>
                            recognized that the <gloss target="#t_MMPA_1">MMPA</gloss> has resulted
                            in the development of non-lethal techniques for the study of whales.
                            But, according to <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>, killing of some
                            whales is necessary for certain scientific inquiries and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> is not bound by a law such as the
                                <gloss target="#t_MMPA_1">MMPA</gloss>. Nevertheless, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> is sensitive to the effects of killing
                            on stock size because Iceland is so dependent on the ocean.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> stated that it has good knowledge of
                            minke and fin whale stocks but not sei whales. When asked about the
                            status of these stocks, <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> estimated
                            that there are 7000 fin whales, and 15,000 minke whales. The fin whale
                            estimate is based on a Catch per Unit of effort study in 1970.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> responded to these data by stating
                            that these estimates have not been generally accepted by the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> also expressed concern with the sample
                            size by pointing out that if sample size is too small then all of the
                            taking is unnecessary because it will not yield statistically valid
                            results.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> emphasized that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee found that there
                            was inadequate rationale for the sample size proposed. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> explained that the rationale was
                            justified so that it could monitor catch per unit of effort, age, sex
                            and maturity, and annual variations, among other things. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> commented that much of this research
                            could be done through non-lethal methods and suggested alternative
                            approaches.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> then inquired about Asgrimsson’s
                            statement in the morning meeting that <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> research philosophy is to determine the role of whales
                            in the ecosystem. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> responded that
                            this is a dual purpose with other <pb facs="0990" n="944"
                                xml:id="pg_944"/> research objectives that had been mentioned.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> pointed out that the ecosystem
                            research does not parallel the research needs of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s comprehensive assessment.</p>
                        <p>A discussion followed concerning the fact that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is not opposed to killing of whales
                            per se for scientific purposes but in order to justify the killing there
                            must be an adequate rationale. Japan’s research proposal at the last
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting was cited as an example
                            where the Scientific Committee did not object per se to the proposed
                            killing of 825 whales but rather objected to the sampling design.<note

                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> argued that it was necessary to
                            conduct some killing to study hormone levels, energy systems, tissues
                            for electrophoretic analysis, pregnancy rates and weights of whales.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> recognized the usefulness of
                            non-lethal techniques, but felt that their use was often too
                            time-consuming and expensive.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> responded that even if lethal
                            techniques can be justified, there is still a need for adequate stock
                            assessment. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> reiterated the fact
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>’s research program needs to be
                            examined in light of <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> criteria which
                            focuses on the comprehensive assessment of all whale stocks.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> expressed its view that the
                            practicality of a non-lethal approach only has too often been left out
                            of discussions concerning research. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                            >GOI</gloss>’s approach is based on its interpretation of the 1990 date
                            to “undertake” the comprehensive assessment of whales. The combination
                            of lethal and non-lethal techniques will most likely ensure that
                            important data are collected before 1990.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> responded that it interprets the
                            1990 date to mean that the comprehensive assessment is only to be
                            initiated by that date and the time limits <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"

                            clarified its interpretation of the date to mean that all data shall
                            have been contributed by 1990 in order that the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> can assess the status of whale stocks to determine
                            whether any modifications of the moratorium are appropriate.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> shifted the discussion by inquiring
                            whether the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has an overall plan
                            with regards to its whale research program. <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> responded with a brief discussion of some of the
                            ongoing research at this time and by emphasizing that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> approach focuses on whales <pb
                                facs="0991" n="945" xml:id="pg_945"/> in which there is a national
                            interest. Much of the research concerns the assessment of whale
                            populations in and around <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            waters.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> asked if <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> could share its research plan with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            stated that there is not a single plan, but it could provide <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> with the annual report on marine
                            mammals that is submitted to Congress. <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> also estimated that <gloss target="#t_NMFS_1"
                                >NMFS</gloss> is spending around 2½ million dollars on whale
                            research.</p>
                        <p>A discussion followed concerning the possibility of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> assisting <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                >GOI</gloss> with the synoptic survey of whales in the North
                            Atlantic. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> expressed little interest
                            in contributing to a survey off the U.S. Coast because previous U.S.
                            research had shown that whales were in Canadian waters during the period
                            of the synoptic survey.</p>
                        <p>In the concluding moments of the discussion, <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> emphasized that it is not opposed to lethal techniques
                            per se but before such techniques are used certain criteria must be met
                            including the collection of adequate data concerning the affected
                            stocks, knowledge of the impact of the lethal takings on the stocks, and
                            an acceptable statistical and biological rationale for the number of
                            proposed lethal takings.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> reiterated its position that it has
                            met all of these criteria and that the lethal takings will not harm the
                            existing stock of whales. <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> wants
                            quicker answers because of the 1990 date and it wants answers that can
                            only be obtained through lethal techniques.</p>
                        <p>Both sides agreed that they had discussed the important differences
                            between the philosophies of research of the two countries and that they
                            understood better each other’s positions.</p>

                                revoke) scientific whaling permits until uncertainties identified by

                                Secretary of Commerce, Iceland’s continued taking of whales was

                                the criteria outlined at the July discussions. The steps are: 1)
                                reduce the 1987 take of 40 sei whales to 20 (i.e. this would bring
                                the overall level from 120 to 100); 2) redesign its entire research
                                program with the aim that the number of whales taken be kept to the
                                minimum (it is our understanding from Ambassador Ingvarsson that
                                this is intended to signal further reductions in 1988—an
                                interpretation also conveyed to Ambassador Ruwe by Foreign Minister
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HS_2">Hermannsson</persName>); 3) continue
                                its cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and to
                                take account of scientific views expressed there; and 4) consult
                                with us on the implementation of this offer and on its scientific
                                program as a whole. Due to the imminent arrival of the sei whales at

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">International Conservation Implications</p>
                            <p>The most effective means of gaining whale conservation goals is
                                through voluntary compliance by the government(s) involved. The
                                threat of certification under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                    >Pelly</persName> Amendment has thus far been the primary means
                                by which we influenced Iceland on the scientific whaling issue. It
                                is our view that the Icelandic response, while disappointing, moves
                                in the right direction and contains sufficient substance to allow us
                                to pursue our conservation objectives through means other than
                                certification.</p>
                            <p>Iceland has repeated on several occasions that certification will
                                result in its withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                    >IWC</gloss>, possibly along with several other states. Thus one
                                result of certification could be to reduce the influence of the US,
                                and other states, on Iceland’s international whaling policy
                                decisions. Such a development could not be viewed as strengthening
                                the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s conservation regime.</p>
                            <p>Certification will result in a serious bilateral confrontation and
                                put us in an adversarial position vis-a-vis Iceland. Under these
                                circumstances, the US ability to influence <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> whaling policy would be drastically reduced or
                                ended. The reduction or end of US leverage in Reykjavik will lessen
                                our ability to meet our conservation objectives.</p>
                            <p>As long as certification is kept as a threat, Iceland may be more
                                inclined to meet US and <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                                concerns over its program. Other than the loss of its whale meat
                                sales to Japan, and damage to its international reputation,
                                certification by itself would create no real economic imposition on
                                Iceland. (Since Iceland does not fish in the US <gloss

                                and absent any real intention to impose economic sanctions, the
                                Icelanders may have little or no reason to cooperate bilaterally or
                                in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>.</p>

                                IP’s electoral strength and reduce its willingness to defend our

                                    >IWC</gloss> to “push them around.”</p>
                            <p>Certification will inevitably result in Iceland attempting to use the
                                presence of the Icelandic Defense Force (<gloss target="#t_IDF_1"
                                    >IDF</gloss>) at Keflavik as a bargaining tool, as it has done
                                in the past under similar circumstances. Initially, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> is not likely to take drastic
                                steps, such as closing the base or asking for specific missions to
                                be ended. However, there are alternatives that could dramatically
                                reduce the operational effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_IDF_1"
                                    >IDF</gloss> and eventually threaten the status of the base.

                                some of the missions due to the need to operate over greater

                                were originally made. However, it is safe to assume that inflation

                                Certification Decision</p>
                            <p>Efforts to mitigate the results of a decision to certify fall into
                                three categories. The first are steps that could be taken regarding
                                whaling <pb facs="0997" n="951" xml:id="pg_951"/> policy and
                                conservation. Since we do not know what the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> whaling policy would become after certification, it
                                is difficult to concisely list possible steps we could take.
                                However, the US would continue to discuss scientific whaling with
                                Iceland as well as the implications of certification.</p>
                            <p>The second category are steps to mitigate reductions in the military
                                effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_IDF_1">IDF</gloss> or a
                                change in the status of the base. In the 1976 paper referred to
                                above, there is a lengthy analysis of what actions (based on 1976
                                requirements) <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> could take to
                                replace the functions carried out at Keflavik. Although there are
                                technically feasible alternatives listed for each mission, some
                                relocation options might not be politically possible today and
                                others would be prohibitively expensive, especially in a period of
                                reduced budgets.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in the area of foreign policy and bilateral relations, a
                                decision by the President not to impose sanctions under the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment would
                                avoid worsening the situation. We have been unable to identify any
                                other reasonable measures (such as in trade relations or <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> affairs) that could be offered
                                to the Icelanders to mitigate certification.</p>

                            <p>The Department of State supports Option B which is best calculated to
                                provide progress toward an improved whale conservation regime. We
                                are opposed to Option A and see it as likely to produce results
                                counterproductive to our whaling policy objectives and national
                                security interests.</p>
                            <p>We recognize the primary role of the Secretary of Commerce on this
                                issue and the important whaling policy questions at stake. We also
                                believe that the potential negative impact on bilateral relations
                                and national security are significant and must be considered within
                                the context of a decision to certify.</p>
                            <p>This dispute has now reached a juncture where it is clear that
                                Iceland is putting forward its final position in this year’s round
                                of whaling policy negotiations. We believe it is incumbent upon the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to assess an appropriate
                                course of action vis-a-vis Iceland that takes into account not only
                                whaling concerns, but also foreign policy and our security interests
                                in Iceland.</p>
                            <p>In considering our response to the Icelandic proposal, an important
                                consideration is whether the Secretary of Commerce can use means
                                other than certification to accomplish US conservation objectives.
                                We believe he can and that a decision not to certify is justified
                                under the present circumstances.</p>
                            <p>While recognizing the statutory responsibility of the Secretary of

                                Amendment, we operate from the premise <pb facs="0998" n="952"

                                has discretion in making a decision whether or not to certify that a
                                nation is diminishing the effectiveness of the <gloss

                                respect to scientific whaling, but can and should consider
                                certification on a case-by-case basis, in light of all relevant
                                factors, with a view to what enhances/diminishes the effectiveness
                                of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. While we recognize the
                                risk of litigation and arguable distinctions between this and the
                                Japan case, we believe that a decision not to certify can be
                                justified legally.</p>
                            <p>We share the US goal of promoting the effective conservation of
                                whales and have contributed significantly to the Department of
                                Commerce’s efforts in this regard. We recognize that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> proposal does not conform to the
                                optimal objectives of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and
                                the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. However it does represent
                                progress toward the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                                conservation regime on which we can expect to build further: it
                                reduces the number of whales taken this year, opens the way for
                                further reductions next year, keeps Iceland in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and retains US influence. There is
                                no evidence that certification would produce equal results—and there
                                are strong indications to the contrary.</p>
                            <p>We do not consider certification to be the the most effective way of
                                furthering US whaling policy nor to bring Iceland into closer
                                conformity with the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                                conservation regime. It will reduce, or end, our influence on
                                Iceland’s whaling decisions.</p>
                            <p>While it is impossible to predict how Iceland would respond to
                                certification, we strongly believe that it will be seen as an insult
                                to national pride and a potential threat to its largest money
                                earner—fisheries exports—resulting from the possibility (no matter
                                how remote) of sanctions being applied under <persName

                                off a downward spiral in our bilateral and security relationship
                                that will be difficult to arrest once begun.</p>
                            <p>We believe that the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> proposal
                                represents the most constructive position we are likely to receive
                                from Iceland and it should be accepted. It is our understanding that
                                it was agreed only with great difficulty by the three-party
                                government coalition and, should we press now for additional
                                concessions, new formulations could be worse from our
                                perspective.</p>
                            <p>We would make clear in that we do not endorse Iceland’s decision and
                                that we intend to continue to press for more flexibility; Iceland
                                    <pb facs="0999" n="953" xml:id="pg_953"/> indicated in its
                                response that it is prepared to continue discussions. Additional
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> concessions are far more
                                likely if the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> can portray them
                                as voluntary, rather than having them seen as a result of US
                                “coercion.” As an example, non-certification would leave open the
                                possibility of further cooperative non-lethal research that could
                                reduce Iceland’s rationale for conducting scientific whaling.
                                Iceland has stated several times its willingness to use non-lethal
                                methods to accomplish its research aims.</p>
                            <p>Should the US certify Iceland, Japan would almost certainly cease its
                                purchases of whale meat taken under the special permits in order to
                                avoid being certified. Iceland would view the Japanese decision as a
                                result of US coercion and interference in the trade relations
                                between two of America’s allies. Although not a major factor in
                                Iceland’s exports, the added loss of a trading partner would further
                                strain our relations with Reykjavik.</p>
                            <p>The crucial base at Keflavik remains Iceland’s most important “card”
                                in any dispute with the US, and it is one that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> has not hesitated to use in the
                                past. In recent years security cooperation with Iceland has improved
                                markedly in a broad range of areas, despite problems that occur in
                                relations between close friends and allies. However, Iceland defines
                                this issue as touching on its national sovereignty and of
                                fundamental importance to its special relationship with the US.
                                Should the US certify, there will be an immediate public reaction
                                against the US and our military presence. The reduction or loss of
                                one or more of the missions currently carried out at Keflavik would
                                have an immediate and highly negative effect on our national
                                security and closure of the base could be devastating. If our 35
                                year old security relationship is seriously damaged by this issue,
                                the political will and consensus necessary in Iceland to maintain
                                our presence might prove impossible to reconstruct.</p>
                            <p>Outside of security and bilateral areas, there are other steps the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> could take that will work
                                against our interests. If certified, the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> could initiate steps to withdraw from the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, effective in 1988. Iceland, and
                                other whaling nations, have raised the possibility of founding a new
                                international organization to regulate whaling. It is not clear
                                whether this is a serious threat at this time.</p>
                            <p>Acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> proposal can
                                be presented to Congress and conservation groups as providing more

                                conservation regime than would have been possible through
                                certification. We will be able to cite that fewer whales will be
                                taken this year, and there is a good (but informally conveyed)
                                likelihood that Iceland’s program will be further reduced in future
                                years. Iceland will remain in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                    >IWC</gloss> and continue to take account of the scientific
                                views expressed there, all of which will strengthen the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s conservation regime.</p>

                            <p>The US base at Keflavik, Iceland is of vital importance to US and
                                    <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> security. Its location
                                makes it the linchpin of US efforts to defend North Atlantic sea
                                lines of communication between North America and Europe, as well as
                                an invaluable forward position for the defense of the US. Without
                                unhampered ability to operate US air and naval forces from Keflavik,
                                we would be very hard pressed to reinforce Western Europe in crisis
                                or war, and to defend the US from Soviet nuclear missile attack
                                submarines in the Atlantic Ocean. Even in peacetime, Keflavik is an
                                unrivalled location for daily surveillance of Soviet air and naval
                                activity in the Atlantic. It would be extremely difficult to conduct
                                these operations from any other location. At present, we use
                                Keflavik on favorable terms and without paying base rent. Icelandic
                                cooperation has permitted great progress on modernization and
                                improvement of the US defense posture there.</p>
                            <p><gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> is concerned that the US
                                position in Keflavik, our freedom of operations there, and perhaps
                                even our presence itself, may be jeopardized by the expected
                                Icelandic reaction to a certification decision. The history of the
                                very difficult US-Icelandic “Rainbow” shipping controversy between
                                1984 and 1987<note n="14" xml:id="d334fn14">See <ref
                                        target="#d324fn2">footnote 2, Document 324</ref>.</note>
                                leads us to expect that if certified, Iceland will harden its
                                position rather than sacrifice its national dignity, at considerable
                                expense to friendly bilateral relations. At risk is the US base at
                                Keflavik, as that would be the only lever that Iceland could use to
                                apply pressure upon the US. The result would be serious damage to US
                                defense, and the loss of an important ally.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>Friendly relations between our countries have long contributed to our
                            shared interests in economic growth and international security. The
                            commitment of our nations to the sovereign equality and political
                            independence of states, and to the principles of freedom and democracy,
                            have formed the foundation of this relationship. Quite correctly, in the
                            development and implementation of diverse domestic and international
                            policies, each government has been mindful of legitimate concerns of the
                            other. A profound sense of mutual confidence, without which neither
                            government could entrust important economic and security interests to
                            the other, has thus been preserved and deepened.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, a matter of the utmost concern that certain officials
                            of your government intend to take action which would undermine<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d335fn2">An unknown hand underlined the phrase “which
                                would undermine” and drew a box around the word “would.”</note> this
                            close relationship between our nations. That action is “certification”
                            of Iceland under United States law for continuing a program of
                            scientific research which necessarily involves the taking of whales.</p>
                        <p>My government regards its research program as a legitimate exercise of
                            sovereign rights reserved to Iceland in the International Convention for
                            the Regulation of Whaling, and as a positive contribution to the
                            objectives of the International Whaling Commission (“<gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>”). My government also believes that
                            its whale research program is essential to understanding the marine
                            environment upon which the people of Iceland are compelled to rely for
                            their survival as a society and a State, on an island remote from world
                            centers of population and commerce.<note n="3" xml:id="d335fn3">An

                        <p>My government has undertaken intensive consultations with yours, in order
                            to continue the Icelandic research program in a manner that would be
                            sensitive to your public opinion and your policies, while ensuring that
                            legitimate and indispensable scientific objectives would be achieved.
                            Based on those consultations and on a thorough review of our program, my
                            government has decided upon a substantial reduction of the taking of
                            whales this year, and upon a review of the program <pb facs="1002"
                                n="956" xml:id="pg_956"/> in future years with the aim of keeping

                        <p>My government has, further, decided to continue cooperation with other

                            dissatisfaction in Iceland with the recent activities and method of work

                            expectation that recommendations of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"

                            would not provide the occasion for measures of coercion against

                        <p>In view of my government’s extraordinary effort at accommodation with the
                            United States on whaling for scientific purposes, and in light of
                            Iceland’s earlier acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            moratorium on commercial whaling, it would be impossible for the people
                            and Government of Iceland to understand or accept certification by the
                            United States that Iceland is diminishing the effectiveness of the

                            Rather certification would disregard the sovereign equality and
                            political independence of Iceland, and be an unwarranted threat to the
                            economic security of this nation. Most certainly, Icelanders could not
                            reconcile action by the United States against their country with the
                            good and friendly relations that have been growing between our two
                            nations for decades and were highlighted by your visit to Iceland last

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>Iceland’s determination to continue whaling may yet lead to a
                            confrontation with the United States, but we believe a slight shift in
                            Reykjavik’s position on “scientific whaling” over the past year gives
                            Iceland an opening to meet US concerns without appearing to give in to
                            US pressure. Iceland’s traditional commitment to whaling has been
                            challenged domestically by criticism from scientists, members of
                            parliament, and newspaper editors across the political spectrum.
                            Reykjavik is now moving away from treating scientific whaling as a cover
                            for continuing business as usual to focusing on the truly scientific
                            aspects of the program—giving the government leeway to win support for
                            its scientific program from the International Whaling Commission and
                            thereby avert a showdown with the United States without losing face.
                            Reykjavik’s only other option for heading off possible US sanctions is
                            to “play the Keflavik card”—imposing further restrictions on the
                            US-manned <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> base or demanding
                            economic benefits from the US for its use. We believe Iceland is
                            unlikely to follow this course because a US ban on imports of Icelandic
                            fish would hurt the economy severely, and Reykjavik is probably unsure
                            that action against the base would forestall such sanctions. [<hi

                        <p>Icelandic support for whaling is deep. Although it does not make up a
                            large part of the Icelandic economy (less than 0.5 percent of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>), whaling is a traditional occupation
                            in a country where tradition and culture are jealously guarded.
                            Moreover, as a small fishing nation, Iceland is very sensitive to
                            perceived threats to its sovereignty over territorial waters. Possible
                            US sanctions aimed at forcing a change in <pb facs="1004" n="958"
                                xml:id="pg_958"/> Icelandic whaling practices are seen as such a
                            threat. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Reykjavik originally viewed the International Whaling Commission’s
                                (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) comprehensive assessment of
                            whale stocks as an exercise that would define acceptable limits for
                            future commercial whaling, rather than presage its abolition. Icelanders
                            saw the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s authorization of
                            scientific whaling as an opportunity to gather information for the
                            future management of whale stocks, while Iceland continued to reap
                            economic benefits from the hunt. It was in this context that the
                            Icelandic parliament voted in 1983 to support <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> limits on whaling. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking
                                not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Since Iceland’s scientific whaling began last summer, however, Icelandic
                            attitudes toward whaling have shifted slightly. Scientists, members of
                            parliament, and newspaper editors across the political spectrum have
                            questioned the wisdom of continued whaling. Public discussion over the
                            year has been much less defensive and emotional, and accusations of US
                            “interference” in domestic affairs much less frequent. These changes in
                            the tone of the debate over whaling may be due in part to frequent
                            consultations between the US and Iceland, as well as to efforts by both
                            sides to avoid public comments that could spark Icelandic resentment of
                            the US. The sabotage of whaling facilities by radical environmentalists
                            and the impounding of whale meat by West German authorities in Hamburg
                            may also have contributed to the evolving change in attitude. Although
                            such actions drew public condemnation, they made clear to Icelanders
                            that whaling is an emotional issue for opponents as well as proponents.
                            Moreover, expressions of environmental concern dramatically demonstrated
                            that opposition to commercial whaling is not something arbitrarily
                            created by the US government, but a view shared by private citizens of
                            many countries. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Reykjavik’s position on the question of scientific whaling also appears
                            to have moved slightly since last year; the government is putting
                            greater emphasis on the quality and necessity of its scientific program,
                            rather than simply continuing “business as usual” in whaling behind a
                            facade of science. Iceland’s recent arguments in defense of the
                            scientific whaling program highlight three important points. First,
                            Reykjavik claims that the program is scientifically sound and that it
                            generates needed information on whales and their environment. Second,
                            the government points out that Iceland’s only whaling company, Hvalur
                            H/F, does not earn a profit on its whaling operations. Third, officials
                            declare willingness to cease killing whales, if the scientific program
                            for studying whale stocks and migratory habits could be conducted
                            effectively by other means. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>This change in Iceland’s position on the specific issue of scientific
                            whaling is due to several factors. International and domestic charges
                                <pb facs="1005" n="959" xml:id="pg_959"/> that scientific whaling is
                            a transparent “cover” for commercial whaling wounded Icelandic pride.
                            The shift in emphasis to the truly scientific aspects of the program
                            probably also reflects a decision by Reykjavik to back down somewhat in
                            order to avoid a major confrontation with the United States—which would
                            expose Iceland to the prospect of certification and sanctions under the
                                <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d336fn2">The <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                                Amendment requires that the Secretary of Commerce inform the
                                President if any nation is undertaking actions which diminish the
                                effectiveness of an international fisheries agreement. Violation of
                                    <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> rules for scientific
                                whaling would be grounds for such certification. Once a country has
                                been certified, the President is authorized to impose sanctions on
                                its fish exports to the US. The President must also report to
                                Congress on the action taken, at which point Congress could decide
                                to legislate its own sanctions if it wanted stronger measures than
                                those taken by the President. [Footnote is in the original.]</note>
                            We believe this new focus on scientific goals would allow Iceland to
                            meet US concerns—by bringing its whaling program into line with <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> specifications—yet claim victory for
                            “winning” US support for a sound scientific whaling program, rather than
                            admit to bowing to US and environmentalist pressure. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Iceland has only one significant point of potential leverage on the US to
                            block efforts to restrict whaling: the US-manned <gloss

                            certifies Iceland under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment—even if sanctions are not
                            implemented—Reykjavik is likely to weigh possible actions against the
                            base that would put pressure on the US. If Iceland decided to take
                            action, it would probably move through a series of steps in an
                            incremental escalation designed to force US concessions. In order of
                            likely implementation, Iceland could:</p>

                        <p>We believe it is unlikely, however, that Iceland will eventually resort
                            to any of these measures. Although Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_HS_2">Hermannsson</persName> indicated to US officials
                            in early August that Iceland would pursue a tough line by resuming
                            whaling and “reevaluating the entire bilateral relationship” if
                            Washington certified Iceland under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment, his comments to the press the next day
                            were much less combative. Moreover, the US Ambassador reports that,
                            based on a conversation with <persName corresp="#p_HS_2"
                                >Hermannsson</persName> in late August, Iceland will probably reduce
                            by one half its take of sei whales for 1987 and agree to further
                            revisions in its scientific whaling program for 1988. Lastly, as noted
                                <pb facs="1006" n="960" xml:id="pg_960"/> above, Iceland’s position
                            on whaling has changed slightly over the last year, creating maneuvering
                            room for Iceland to meet US concerns on scientific whaling without
                            losing face. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>Reykjavik is surely considering that the costs of a US ban on Icelandic
                            fish exports would be enormous—Iceland could immediately lose up to 10
                            percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>. Even sanctions imposed
                            for a short period of time would cause significant disruption in the
                            Icelandic economy. Iceland probably believes the United States is
                            willing to certify and impose sanctions if no concessions are made, and
                            Reykjavik will be reluctant to trigger US punitive measures. Iceland
                            would be quick to exploit any signs of differences between Washington
                            agencies, of course, in order to push a tougher line on whaling. [<hi

                        <p>In our view, there are two circumstance that could persuade Iceland to
                            retaliate against the Keflavik base:</p>
                        <quote><p>—If the Icelandic public were angered by perceived US
                                interventionism.</p>
                            <p>—If Reykjavik became convinced that actions against the base would
                                prevent the United States from taking punitive measure. [<hi

                        <p>At present, however, the public seems as concerned with environmentalist
                            charges that “science” is being used deceitfully to justify hunting
                            whales as it is with the prospect of US sanctions. Icelandic officials,
                            moreover, appear unsure that action on Iceland’s part would result in US
                            concessions. If the dispute continued to the point of US certification

                            Amendment, Iceland might threaten retaliation against the base, but only
                            if it believed this would raise the issue to a political level where it
                            may launch a final “appeal” for a concession. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                        <p>The current dispute over whaling is superficially reminiscent of the
                            famous “Cod Wars” of past years. The Cod Wars were disputes in 1958,
                            1972, and 1975 between Iceland and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss> over the extent of Iceland’s exclusive fishing zone.
                            These disputes led to exchanges of fire and ramming incidents between
                            Icelandic gunboats and <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> frigates. In
                            an effort to obtain US pressure on London, Iceland threatened to expel
                            the US base at Keflavik and withdraw from <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. In 1975 Reykjavik broke diplomatic relations before
                            London finally recognized Iceland’s unilateral claim to a 200-mile
                            fishing limit. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>There is little in common, however, between the current whaling dispute
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>-Icelandic Cod Wars. In the
                            Cod Wars, Reykjavik acted to protect vital economic interests; in the
                            whaling issue, it is <pb facs="1007" n="961" xml:id="pg_961"/> Iceland’s
                            actions that expose it to the loss of important economic interests
                            through US sanctions. Whereas Iceland took unilateral action in the Cod
                            Wars, action in the whaling case was initiated by <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> efforts—with Icelandic support—to
                            regulate whaling. In the Cod Wars, Iceland was acting out of an
                            environmentally based concern to preserve fish stocks. In the scientific
                            whaling dispute, Iceland’s current position is opposed by
                            environmentalists who believe that fewer or no whales need be killed to
                            conduct necessary research. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>The main similarity, however, may be the most dangerous. As they did in
                            the Cod Wars, Icelanders may grow to see themselves as defending their
                            national sovereignty against a hostile Great Power. This view cemented
                            the Icelandic position in the Cod Wars, and—if public outrage grew—could
                            also do so in the scientific whaling dispute. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                            There are two issues before us. One, whether or not to certify Iceland
                            and the degree of discretion the Secretary of Commerce has in making
                            this decision. And, two, the foreign and national security implications
                            that flow from this decision.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_SSB_1">Smart</persName>:</hi> The
                                <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment requires the
                            Secretary of Commerce to inform the President of any action by a foreign
                            government that runs against any international conservation agreement or
                            its intentions. It is a two-step process. First, we must tell the
                            President what happened and then, second, the President decides what to
                            do regarding sanctions. Iceland’s scientific whaling program was
                            rejected by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and they have not
                            given the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> a proposed alternate
                            program. Commerce did not certify Iceland when it took its first 80
                            whales but we advised them at that time that we would certify if they
                            started their second phase of whaling. Furthermore, our counsel tells us
                            that under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment
                            we are legally obligated to certify them.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_BAI_1">Burns</persName>:</hi>
                            There is a long history behind this issue. In the Japanese Whaling
                            Association case environmentalist groups challenged Secretary Mac
                            Baldridge seeking to enjoin him to certify Japan for whaling practices
                            which were in contravention to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                            >IWC</gloss>’s scheme. Baldridge said that the Secretary of Commerce had
                            discretion under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            Amendment whether to certify Japan or not. He exercised this discretion
                            and concluded that the Executive Agreement reached between the United
                            States and Japan whereby the Japanese agreed to end all commercial
                            whaling by 1988 justified not certifying Japan in this instance. The
                            District and Appellate Court ruled that the Secretary of Commerce did
                            not have discretion under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment not to certify. The United States
                            Supreme Court, after reviewing the fuzzy legislative history of the
                            Amendment, concluded that the Secretary of Commerce did indeed have
                            discretion under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                                Amendment.<note n="2" xml:id="d337fn2">See <ref target="#d317fn5"
                                    >footnote 5, Document 317</ref>.</note> On this point, the
                            Department of Justice has an easy call: under the rule of law the
                            Secretary of Commerce has discretion. It is just as clear, however, that
                            it would be an abuse of discretion by the Secretary of Commerce not to
                            certify on the record before him in this case. Secretary Baldridge could
                            have certified Iceland a year ago, but did not. For over a year the
                            United States has acted reasonably and patiently in dealing with
                            Iceland. In conclusion, it is the Department of Justice’s view that <pb
                                facs="1009" n="963" xml:id="pg_963"/> were the Secretary not to
                            certify the United States would lose its case in court.</p>
                        <p>Our congressional relations would be damaged if we do not certify.
                            Representative <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName> and
                            others would go “beserk” if the Administration does not certify in this
                            situation. Remember, it is a two-step process. The first step being
                            certification and the second step being sanctions. At the sanction’s
                            stage the President can consider the national security concerns. Japan,
                            however, will not import the whale meat if Iceland is certified.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General was told this morning that it is the Department’s
                            view that certification will be required under the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment if Iceland takes
                            another whale and that we could not defend in court the failure to
                            certify. The Attorney General said that it might be prudent to have the
                            President or Vice President call the Prime Minister of Iceland and say
                            that every play has an end and we are pulling the curtain down on this
                            play.</p>

                            Everything that Defense says in this discussion is irrelevant.
                            (Laughter) What Defense says is only relevant as to our national
                            security interest. It is not relevant to the legal debate.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we at State do not contend that we have the right to tell
                            the Secretary of Commerce not to certify or how and whether to exercise
                            the discretion given to him under a statute. The Department can advise
                            Commerce regarding the procedures involved.</p>
                        <p>I will address Arnie’s (<persName corresp="#p_BAI_1">Burns</persName>)
                            second conclusion concerning the Secretary of Commerce’s discretion. It
                            does not follow automatically that a given event requires certification.
                            Rather, the decision to certify should be reached through a <hi
                                rend="italic">reasoned</hi> process.</p>
                        <p>The point is, the Secretary of Commerce has discretion. The statute says
                            that he is to <hi rend="italic">investigate</hi> the events. I do not
                            have the benefit of knowing all the facts in the investigation, but I do
                            know the record of the last six months and it’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >very</hi> impressive to me. It should be addressed in writing by
                            the Department of Commerce indicating why it requires certification
                            under the Amendment. Review of the Record indicates (1) they’ve reduced
                            their overall take of whales by half—from 200 to 100, (2) Iceland is
                            prepared to redesign their entire research program to keep it at a
                            minimum. Now, this doesn’t satisfy me or Arnie (<persName
                                corresp="#p_BAI_1">Burns</persName>) because it falls short of the
                            Japan case where they had agreed to take no more whales by fixed date.
                            But they have said concretely that they’d move in the right direction.
                            (3) They have indicated their intention to remain in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. This is meaningful. The meaning we
                            have given to scientific whaling is a very tough one. The <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> initiative clearly is helping
                            conservation and we are moving forward, therefore, with our conservation
                            goals. It is in our best interest to keep Iceland engaged in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>. Now, I am not arguing what they have
                            done is satisfactory <pb facs="1010" n="964" xml:id="pg_964"/> for the
                            long term, but it is satisfactory enough for State to want in written
                            form from Commerce the reason why it is so bad that they have to
                            certify. We need more debate regarding the scope of discretion.</p>

                            State’s recommended changes to the resolution were to reserve U.S.

                            this early on to preserve flexibility. Iceland has moved their position
                            significantly. Quantitatively it is true that they have not moved as far
                            as we want. Qualitatively it seems that they have come far

                            Secretary not certifying would be to pass a law which states the

                            would undermine both; (1) Iceland would withdraw from the <gloss

                            That’s right. Japan will then not import their whale meat.</p>

                            No, I think it’s looking, for example, for a further declaration by

                        <p>Then, it might be useful for Commerce to negotiate with Iceland and get

                        <p>The President might reveal in his letter his disinclanation toward

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I wish to thank you for your thoughtful and important letter of September
                                2.<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">See <ref target="#d335">Document
                                    335</ref>.</note> The longstanding special relationship between
                            Iceland and the United States is of great personal importance to me and
                            I regret that it has been troubled by the scientific whaling dispute.
                            During my visit to Reykjavik in October of 1986, I was impressed by the
                            warmth and strength of Iceland’s ties to the United States.<note n="3"

                        <p>I agree that we must preserve and strengthen this relationship while at
                            the same time remaining mindful of the legitimate concerns of each
                            government. Clearly, we have a difference of views with respect <pb
                                facs="1017" n="971" xml:id="pg_971"/> to Iceland’s taking of a
                            number of whales. I firmly believe these differences can and should be
                            resolved in the spirit of friendship and cooperation that has been the
                            basis of US–Iceland relations for many decades. I am heartened by the
                            amount of progress that has been made thus far by working together to
                            resolve these differences. I also want you to know that I appreciate the
                            importance and the difficulties involved in Iceland’s decision to modify
                            voluntarily its scientific program and continue its cooperation with the
                            International Whaling Commission. I hope that you can appreciate the
                            efforts that the Secretary of Commerce has made thus far in deferring
                            certification under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            Amendment since the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> annual
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>I recognize and appreciate the progress which Iceland has already made.
                            Your government’s most recent proposal<note n="4" xml:id="d338fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d335">Document 335</ref>.</note> contained a
                            number of constructive elements, and I directed the Attorney General to
                            review the legal obligations of the Secretary of Commerce in this
                            matter. The Attorney General concludes that the Secretary of Commerce,
                            in the present circumstances, is under a direct legal obligation to
                            certify Iceland if additional whales are taken during this season.</p>
                        <p>This is a matter of considerable and immediate concern to me because, as
                            I understand it, Iceland intends to resume its scientific whaling
                            program on September 10. In view of the great importance both our
                            governments attach to this issue, and the potential implications of the
                            situation, I believe it is incumbent upon us to be sure that we have
                            exhausted every opportunity to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution
                            of this matter.</p>
                        <p>With that goal in mind, I would suggest that further consultations be
                            held between our governments at the earliest possible time. It is
                            crucial that we explore every possible means of resolving this matter
                            before any action is taken which might make a mutually satisfactory
                            solution impossible to achieve. I look forward to your earliest response
                            to my proposal for further constructive talks, and I personally urge you
                            to maintain the pause in your scientific research whaling program in the
                            interim.</p>

                            agreed for Ottawa on September 9. Ottawa was selected as the site due to
                            the travel there of Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_HS_2"
                                >Hermannsson</persName> on other business.</p>

                            was from the Foreign and Fisheries Ministries. Foreign Minister

                            agreed to present to their respective governments a three part
                            understanding which was to be put into a written document (ad ref text
                            of the understanding follows at para [9] below). Ambassador Ingvarsson
                            agreed to present this understanding to the Foreign Ministry for
                            consideration at the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> Cabinet’s
                            regular Thursday morning meeting on September 10. On a personal basis,
                            he opined that the understanding could prove acceptable.</p>
                        <p>6. [5.] Both sides agreed that the text should not be made public nor
                            should the press be informed of the contents of the Ottawa talks at this
                            time. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> noted that the
                            agreement was also ad ref for the US and would need to be approved by
                            the Acting Secretary of Commerce and senior officials at Justice and
                            State. In the meantime, he <pb facs="1019" n="973" xml:id="pg_973"/>
                            urged that Iceland continue its pause in the taking of whales. Dr.

                            position of the Secretary of Commerce had not changed—Iceland’s taking
                            of whales after the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> recommendation
                            not to do so had created a basis for certification. Should Iceland take
                            any further whales prior to agreeing to bring its research program into
                            line with the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> resolution on

                            that this ad referendum understanding was beyond the limit of his
                            negotiating mandate. Iceland must agree in unambigious and public terms
                            to abide by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s scientific
                            advice. Also, should the U.S. and Iceland fail in their efforts to
                            reform the Scientific Committee’s process for the review of research
                            permits, Iceland must still abide by the views of that committee. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CAJT_1">Calio</persName> stated that he was
                            prepared to begin efforts to reform the committee on an expedited basis
                            and was prepared to contact key commissioners immediately after the ad
                            ref understanding was confirmed by both sides. He added that there was
                            no reason other than cost why the reform process could not be considered
                            at an inter-sessional meeting in order to try to have the 1988 review of
                            special permits by the Scientific Committee conducted under revised
                            procedures. He indicated that he would consult with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Chairman when appropriate.</p>
                        <p>8. [7.] Ingvarsson stated that he believed this proposed understanding
                            provided a good basis for settling the issue and he thought his
                            government would be able to respond quickly. Should there be a need for
                            further discussion of the proposed text, he expected it could be carried
                            out in Washington through the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>9. [8.] Begin text of ad ref agreement:</p>
                        <p>1) For 1988 and thereafter, the Government of Iceland would submit its
                            research program for review by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Scientific Committee and would carry out the recommendations of that
                            committee.</p>
                        <p>2) The United States would not certify the Government of Iceland for the
                            80 fin whales and the 20 sei whales taken in 1987.</p>
                        <p>3) The United States will work with Iceland and other <gloss

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1"
                                >GOJ</gloss> officials met in Washington October 13–15, 1987, to
                            discuss the Japanese Scientific Whale Research Program. The revised
                            proposal involves the taking of 300 minke whales (original proposal
                            called for taking 825 minkes and 50 sperm whales). The proposal is now
                            called a “feasibility study . . . for preliminary research” to highlight
                            a new sampling method which takes into account comments by the
                            Scientific Committee. It deletes the most controversial portion of the
                            original proposal which was to determine age-specific mortality.
                            However, the <gloss target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> plans to provide a
                            simulation study of this matter and analysis for Scientific Committee

                        <p>2. Begin text. Representatives of the Government of Japan and of the
                            United States Government met in Washington October 13–15, 1987, to
                            discuss the Japanese Scientific Whale Research Program. The Japanese
                            delegation was led by Goroku Satake, Director General of the Japanese
                            Fisheries Agency; the U.S. Delegation was led by J. Curtis Mack, II,
                            Acting Under Secretary of Commerce, <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1"
                                >NOAA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Japan recognizes that the United States considers that whaling policy
                            should not be treated as a bilateral issue and further considers that
                            the International Whaling Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>) is the appropriate multilateral forum for discussion
                            of the merits of the research programs involving the taking of whales
                            submitted by Japan and other nations. The United States reiterated that
                            the Secretary of Commerce would have no discretion but to impose
                            sanctions on Japan under the Pack<pb facs="1021" n="975" xml:id="pg_975"
                            />wood Amendment if the Secretary were to determine that the Japanese
                            Research Program diminished the effectiveness of the International
                            Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.</p>
                        <p>Japan announced that, in response to the recommendation made by the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> at its 39th annual

                                    >footnote 14, Document 333</ref>.</note> Japan had developed a
                            new preliminary research program to address the problems raised at the
                            last <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee meeting
                            on Japan’s original research proposal. Japan expressed its intention to
                            immediately submit its new research proposal to the members of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee for review
                            by correspondence.</p>
                        <p>Japanese scientists briefed Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">William
                                Evans</persName>, Assistant Administrator of the National Marine
                            Fisheries Service (<gloss target="#t_NMFS_1">NMFS</gloss>), and Dr.
                            Michael Tillman, Senior <gloss target="#t_NMFS_1">NMFS</gloss> Scientist
                            and Former Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Scientific Committee. Based on that briefing, the United States reached
                            the preliminary conclusion that Japan’s proposal is a serious proposal,
                            developed in good faith and aimed at achieving scientific purposes. The
                            United States reserved its final position until the proposal has been
                            thoroughly reviewed by its scientific advisors and other <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee members.</p>
                        <p>The United States stated that it would support the efforts of Japan to
                            seek an expeditious review by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Scientific Committee of Japan’s new research proposal. Japan stated that
                            it is making a good-faith effort to follow the procedures of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, and expressed its hope that the
                            United States would therefore take no adverse action against Japan under
                            the <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName> or <persName
                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendments. The United States
                            pointed out that if Japan begins research involving the taking of whales
                            pursuant to the new research proposal, a question facing the Secretary
                            of Commerce in applying the <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1"
                                >Packwood</persName> Amendment will be whether the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee has been
                            satisfied that the new proposal cures “the serious uncertainties
                            identified in its discussion as to the capability of the research
                            methods (originally) proposed to contribute sufficiently reliable
                            results needed for the comprehensive assessment or for other critically
                            important research needs.” Therefore, the United States continued, it
                            will be crucial to the United States that the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee issue its report on Japan’s new
                            research proposal before Japan begins research pursuant to that
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>The United States commended Japan for seeking to be responsive to the
                            recommendation made by the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> to
                            Japan. The United States emphasized that the position the United States
                            eventually takes on Japan’s new research proposal will be based on
                            careful review by its own scientific advisors and consideration of the
                            views expressed by <pb facs="1022" n="976" xml:id="pg_976"/> other
                            members of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific
                            Committee. The United States noted that it would be helpful if the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee were to
                            hold an intersessional meeting to discuss the merits of Japan’s new
                            proposal. The United States assured Japan that the United States’ review
                            of Japan’s new proposal would be fair and impartial.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing that the Secretary of Commerce must honor his
                            responsibilities under U.S. law, particularly the <persName

                                corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendments, both the United
                            States and Japan expressed the hope that their important and mutually
                            beneficial fishery relations would not be disrupted. The meetings were
                            conducted in a cordial atmosphere, and both sides considered them to
                            have been productive. End text.</p>

                                not succeed in satisfying the Committee that the defects in its
                                program have been cured.” (Department of State, Central Foreign

                            its revised “research whaling” plan. Mothership will sail December 23;

                            mid-January. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Economic Counselor was called to Fisheries Agency late on December 22
                            to receive “advance, official notification” that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> has decided to implement its revised
                            research whaling scheme under Article 8 of the International Whaling
                            Convention. Far Seas Fisheries Division Director Tokio Ono told him that
                            after review of the results of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Scientific Committee’s intersessional meeting in Cambridge, <gloss

                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> had concluded that “no substantial
                            objection to the Japanese research plan” had been posed in the
                            Committee’s report.</p>
                        <p>3. Ono said that the Japanese fleet will consist of one mothership and
                            two catcherboats. The mothership will leave Yokohama on the morning of
                            December 23; the two catcherboats will sail from Shimonoseki on
                            Christmas morning. The fleet is expected to begin taking a total catch
                            of 300 minke whales in Antarctic waters (105–115 degrees east longitude,
                            and south of 55 degrees south latitude) in mid-January and to complete
                            operations in mid-March.</p>
                        <p>4. Ono said that Fisheries Agency Director-General Satake would
                            informally brief the Japanese press the same evening on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss> decision. Advance notice was provided
                            to the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in view of the close
                            consultations with US that had taken place in recent months.</p>
                        <p>5. MOFA Fisheries Division Director Nogami phoned Economic Counselor
                            subsequent to meeting with Ono to convey substantially <pb facs="1025"
                                n="979" xml:id="pg_979"/> same information. Nogami said that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOJ_1">GOJ</gloss>’s careful study of the Committee
                            Report revealed “no important scientific views having a vital effect on
                            the appropriateness of the Japanese research whaling plan.”</p>
                        <p>6. In response to both, Economic Counselor noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would receive our delegation’s report
                            of the Scientific Committee meeting in the near future and that
                            obviously it would merit careful study.</p>
                        <p>7. We understand that Greenpeace called a press conference here the
                            afternoon of December 22, apparently to denounce a Japanese decision
                            that the environmental activist group considered a foregone
                            conclusion.</p>

                        <p>1. On the evening of February 9, the Secretary of Commerce William Verity
                            signed a letter to the President indicating that by that letter he was
                            certifying Japan under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName>
                            and the <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName>-Magnuson
                            Amendments because nationals of Japan are conducting whaling operations
                            that diminish the effectiveness of the International Whaling
                            Commission’s (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) conservation program
                            (text of letter in para 3 below). We understand that Secretary Verity
                            also sent a letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1"
                                >Shultz</persName> informing him that he had made such a
                            certification to the President and further recommending that the

                                >GOJ</gloss> of the certification (text in para 4 below). Apparently
                            the Japanese Embassy in Washington learned of the certification the
                            evening of February 9 through a newspaper correspondent who alleged that
                            he had been informed by a Commerce official.</p>
                        <p>2. In order to respond to Japanese Embassy request for both confirmation
                            on the press reports and any further information concerning

                        <p>3. Commerce officials subsequently released a press statement mid-day
                            February 10 which contains an erroneous statement in the lead sentence
                            which incorrectly states that Secretary Verity has recommended sanctions

                            I determine that nationals of a foreign country are conducting fishing

                            Conservation Program, I am required to certify that fact to you. By this
                            letter, I am certifying that nationals of Japan are conducting whaling
                            operations that diminish the effectiveness of the International Whaling
                            Commission’s (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s) Conservation
                            Program.</p>
                        <p>My decision is based on the following considerations: Nationals of Japan
                            are killing southern hemisphere minke whales under a special permit
                            issued by the Government of Japan for scientific research. The killing
                            of whales pursuant to special permits issued for scientific research
                            programs was the subject of several resolutions adopted by the <gloss

                                (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>/39/24), the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> requested its Scientific Committee to
                            review all such programs and to report whether the programs satisfy
                            certain scientific criteria. In that resolution, the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> also recommended that member
                            governments not issue permits for programs that, in the view of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, do not satisfy the criteria
                            “and therefore are not consistent with the Commission’s conservation
                            policy.”</p>

                                >IWC</gloss> (1) adopted the view that Japan’s program does not
                            satisfy the applicable criteria; and (2) recommended that Japan not <pb
                                facs="1027" n="981" xml:id="pg_981"/> issue the special permit for
                            the program until the serious uncertainties in the program identified by
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee have been
                            resolved to the satisfaction of that Committee. In December 1987, the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee held a
                            special meeting to review a revised research program submitted by Japan
                            in the interim. The report of the Scientific Committee reveals that
                            Japan did not succeed in satisfying the Committee that the defects in
                            its program had been cured. On December 22, 1987, the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> circulated a resolution for a postal
                            vote due February 14, 1988, recommending that Japan not take whales
                            under its revised scientific research program. Nevertheless, the
                            Government of Japan proceeded to issue the permit and, pursuant to that
                            permit, nationals of Japan have begun killing southern hemisphere minke
                            whales. Under these circumstances, I have determined, and hereby
                            certify, that nationals of Japan are conducting whaling operations that
                            diminish the effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            conservation program.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment provides that

                            may be granted in the succeeding year by not less than 50 percent. If
                            remedial action is not taken within one year, further fish allocations
                            may not be granted. Japan is not currently receiving any
                            allocations.</p>

                            within 365 days from the date of certification. Although Japan does not
                            currently receive allocations, this certification has ramifications for

                            William Verity has recommended sanctions against Japan saying that its
                            killing of whales diminished the effectiveness of the International
                            Whaling Commission’s (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s)
                            Conservation Program.</p>

                            of a foreign country in U.S. waters diminishes the effectiveness of an

                        <p>As a result of Verity’s finding, Japan’s future fish allocations in U.S.

                        <p>Last June, the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Scientific Committee
                            questioned the benefit of a Japanese research program that allowed the
                            killing of whales by Japanese fishermen for scientific purposes. As a
                            result, the full <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> asked Japan not to
                            permit whaling by its nationals until those questions were resolved.
                            Despite the fact that the questions have not yet been resolved, Japan
                            issued a permit allowing whaling for scientific purposes, and Japanese
                            fishermen have begun killing southern hemisphere minke whales. End press
                            statement. Secretary of Commerce C. William Verity in response to
                            Japan’s killing of whales under a contested research permit, today
                            informed the President that he has “certified” that Japan’s whaling
                            diminished the effectiveness of the International Whaling Commission’s
                                (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) Conservation Program.</p>
                        <p>Under U.S. law, the Secretary is responsible for notifying the President
                            when nationals of a foreign country conduct fishing operations that
                            diminish the effectiveness of an International Fishery Conservation
                            Program. As a result of today’s certification, Japan’s present and
                            future fish allocations in U.S. waters are reduced by at least half and
                            the President has discretion to apply an embargo on fish products
                            imported from Japan. Japan does not presently have any U.S. fish
                            allocations.</p>

                            Scientific Committee held a special meeting to review a modified
                            Japanese research program. The report of that meeting indicated that,
                            although the modified program was given serious consideration,
                            uncertainties in the program had not been resolved. Nevertheless, Japan
                            issued a scientific whaling permit and nationals of that country have

                        <p>On February 9, 1988, I certified to you, under the <persName

                            whaling operations that diminished the effectiveness of the
                            International Whaling Commission (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>)
                            Conservation program.<note n="2" xml:id="d344fn2">See <ref

                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName>-Magnuson Amendment
                            requires the Secretary of State to withhold from a certified country at
                            least 50 percent of the fishing privileges that would otherwise be
                            available to that country. The <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment additionally authorizes the President to
                            restrict any or all imports of fisheries products of the certified
                            country. The <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1">Pelly</persName> Amendment
                            also provides that within 60 days following the certification (i.e.
                            April 9), you must notify the Congress of any action regarding the
                            certification, and you must inform the Congress of the reasons for any
                            such action that falls short of prohibiting the importation of all fish
                            products of the certified country.</p>
                        <p>Since my certification of Japan, I have reviewed the options available to
                            you and consulted with the agencies of the Trade Policy Review Group
                                (<gloss target="#t_TPRG_1">TPRG</gloss>) as well as the Council on
                            Environmental Quality and the Marine Mammal Commission.</p>
                        <p>Because Japan has not yet indicated any intent to undertake remedial or
                            mitigative actions, I recommend that the strongest possible sanctions
                            available under the <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1"
                            >Packwood</persName>-Magnuson Amendment be imposed. This will entail
                            denial of Japan’s request for the opportunity to fish for 3,000 metric
                            tons of sea snails and 5,000 metric tons of Pacific whiting. It also
                            entails denial of any future allocations so long as the reasons that
                            gave rise to the certification still prevail. I recommend the maximum
                            level of sanctions under the <persName corresp="#p_PRW_1"
                                >Packwood</persName>-Magnuson Amendment to send a message to Japan
                            that the United States will use leverage to uphold conservation programs
                            established by international agreements.</p>
                        <p>In view of my recommendation of full sanctions under the <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRW_1">Packwood</persName>-Magnuson Amendment, I believe
                            it would not be appropriate <pb facs="1031" n="985" xml:id="pg_985"/> to
                            impose additional sanctions under the <persName corresp="#p_PTM_1"
                                >Pelly</persName> Amendment at this time. I do recommend that you
                            reserve that option depending upon further monitoring of the situation.
                            The immediate and prospective effects of a 100 percent reduction of
                            fishing allocations, coupled with Presidential review in the near
                            future, is the most effective means of encouraging Japan to embrace the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> conservation program.</p>
                        <p>These recommendations have the unanimous concurrence of the <gloss

                        <p>111960. Subject: Commerce Decision to Decertify Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>1. On April 8 Commerce Secretary William Verity and Soviet Ambassador
                            Yuriy V. Dubinin exchanged letters (text in para 4 below) which are the
                            basis of the decision by the Secretary of Commerce to withdraw the
                            certification of the U.S.S.R. At the request of the Soviets these
                            letters will not be made public. The decision by the Secretary of
                            Commerce to terminate the certification [of] the Soviet Union will not
                            be made public until after Verity announces this decision in a press
                            statement concerning fisheries and whales (para 2 below) at the JCC
                            meetings in Moscow. We expect him to make his announcement in a press
                            briefing scheduled for April 14.<note n="2" xml:id="d345fn2">See <hi

                            the reasons for his decision will be sent for publication on April 14
                            (provided in para 4 below). Neither Verity’s statement or the <hi

                            exchange of letters. The Secretary of Commerce has withdrawn the
                            certification because the reasons for the April, 1985 certification no
                            longer prevail. The Soviet Union has confirmed that it has ceased
                            commercial whaling and intends to work through the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> for whale research and
                            conservation.</p>
                        <p>2. (C) Classified until after delivered. Begin text of Verity statement
                            on whaling and fisheries matters to be made during JCC meetings in
                            Moscow. In concluding my remarks, I want to announce that I have
                            received assurances from the Soviet Ambassador to the United States
                            confirming that the Soviet Union has ceased commercial whaling and
                            intends to work through the International Whaling Commission (the
                                “<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>”) for whale research and
                            conservation. The cessation of commercial whaling by whaling nations has
                            been a major objective of global environmental groups and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, supported by the United States.</p>
                        <p>I welcome the Soviet decision and hope that it sets a pattern for similar
                            decisions on the part of other whaling nations to work within the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> for the purposes of research and
                            conservation. We look forward to cooperating more closely with our
                            Soviet colleagues in the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>, our
                            fisheries relations, and our broader bilateral agenda. End text of

                            to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Secretary
                            of Commerce is responsible for determining if nationals of a foreign

                            so determines, such certification is reported to the President. On April

                            Soviet harvest of southern hemisphere minke whales was greater than the
                            level the United States considered the U.S.S.R.’s traditional share; (2)
                            the 1984–85 <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> quota for southern
                            hemisphere minke whales was exceeded due to Soviet harvest; and (3)
                            there had been no indication that the Soviets intended to comply with

                        <p>The Soviet Union has ended its commercial harvest for southern hemisphere

                            Secretary, I was pleased by our recent discussions concerning the
                            so-called whaling problem which has for a long time prevented the
                            development of our cooperation in fisheries.</p>
                        <p>It is an evidence of increasing mutual understanding between our
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Let me once again reaffirm, that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                        <p>Regarding the issue of sea mammals the Soviet Union is a principled
                            supporter of international cooperation in research, conservation and
                            rational use of these resources in strict accordance with norms of
                            international law, proceeding from reliable scientific data, based on
                            expert assessments of scientists from different countries. The Soviet
                            Union also comes out for active cooperation at appropriate international

                        <p>In connection with the recent changes the Soviet Union put forward at the

                            Dubinin, Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
                            Washington, D.C. 20036. Dear Mr. Ambassador: I was pleased by our recent
                            discussions concerning the Soviet Union’s policy regarding commercial
                            whaling.</p>
                        <p>As a result of further consultations between our representatives, I
                            understand it to be Soviet policy that the Soviet Union will not resume
                            commercial whaling until the world’s scientists agree that such whaling
                            can be conducted without jeopardizing the well-being of whale
                            populations. I also understand that the Soviet Union will continue to
                            work through the International Whaling Commission for Research and Whale
                            Conservation.</p>
                        <p>I trust that this understanding is correct and, based upon it, I will
                            proceed to terminate the certification of the Soviet Union. I look
                            forward to continued cooperation and discussion on the matters before
                            us. Sincerely, Secretary of Commerce William Verity. End of Verity

                            the meeting of the Scientific Committee in San Diego. Iceland had,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> said, produced 17
                            reports on its whaling research at the meeting in San Diego which varied
                            widely in their content and scientific value. Of the 17 only three
                            studies used research data which required taking whales.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d346fn5">Not found.</note> The U.S. delegation at the
                            Scientific Committee meeting had avoided public criticism of the
                            Icelandic program at San Diego and had not taken a leading position in
                            discussions on the program. According to the latest information he had,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> said that he
                            understood the report of the Scientific Committee on the Icelandic
                            program would be stronger this year than last and that those supporting
                            individual positions would be identified. He said he also expected a
                            fairly clear statement that Iceland had not addressed previous
                            criticisms of its program by the Scientific Committee.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> said that he believed
                            that even without the direct involvement of the U.S. delegation at the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting in New Zealand, the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> would ask Iceland not to issue
                            permits for scientific whaling this year. He noted that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> had a new Environmental Minister<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d346fn6">Nicholas Ridley.</note> who strongly opposed
                            whaling and who would control the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> Commissioner. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> did not offer a resolution against the
                            Icelandic program, then the New Zealanders or the Australians would. If
                            Iceland <pb facs="1036" n="990" xml:id="pg_990"/> were to take whales
                            under these circumstances, it would have broken its commitments under
                            the Ottawa Agreement as well as gone against an <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> resolution on the Icelandic program. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> said that when the Icelandic
                            whaling program would begin would depend on the Gulf Stream and when it
                            brought the fish on which the whales feed into the waters around
                            Iceland. Other things being equal, he expected Iceland to be able to
                            begin taking fin whales in mid-June and sei whales in September. Given
                            this timetable, <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> said there
                            would probably be about one week between the end of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting in New Zealand and the
                            beginning of the Icelandic whaling season.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> added that because of
                            the silence of the U.S. delegation on Icelandic issues at San Diego, the
                            Ottawa Agreement, and an awareness by the other scientists of the
                            importance the U.S. attached to the base at Keflavik, the U.S.
                            delegation had lost some of its scientific credibility. In order to
                            counter this, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> stated
                            how important it was to have Dr. Robert Brownell, Department of Interior
                            and Current Vice Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>’s
                            Scientific Committee, as a member of the U.S. delegation. Mr. Twist of
                            the Marine Mammals Commission supported Evan’s recommendation. The
                            support of Interior was also requested.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> noted that Icelandic
                            Fisheries Minister Asgrimsson had discussed the ecosystem approach when
                            he saw Secretary Verity in February, and had been encouraged to work
                            with the U.S. on this idea since it had some positive aspects which the
                            U.S. could support.<note n="7" xml:id="d346fn7">In telegram 47286 to

                                >Evans</persName> said that even getting Asgrimsson’s talk on the

                        <p>7. Ford Cooper, representing <gloss target="#t_EUR_1">EUR</gloss> at the
                            meeting, expressed the appreciation of all members to the group for the
                            cooperative role which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName>
                            was playing on whaling issues. He said that we were not where we had
                            hoped to be at this stage of the game. We had hoped that the Icelanders
                            would have put forward something different for the Scientific Committee
                            and at least made a gesture toward satisfying the criticisms of the
                            program. They have apparently done nothing and have given no evidence
                            that they wish to avoid a confrontation over whaling this year or to
                            help get us both off the hook. In these circumstances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJF_1">Cooper</persName> said he did not know how we

                            resolution which criticized the Icelandic program.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_CJF_1">Cooper</persName> recommended that the
                            U.S. should be candid with the Icelanders about our concerns and the
                            likely consequences of their failure to revise their program. In the
                            meantime, however, the U.S. should keep its options open with Iceland.
                            He said he hoped <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> would
                            convey to the Icelandic delegation at the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> meeting the following points:<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d346fn8">In telegram 179916 to Bern, June 4, the Department
                                summarized the negotiations between the U.S. and Icelandic

                        <p>—The positions taken by the Icelandic delegation at San Diego did nothing
                            to resolve the problems in the Icelandic program which the Scientific
                            Committee had previously identified.</p>
                        <p>—We are bound by the provisions of the Ottawa Agreement.</p>
                        <p>—We now see the situation moving toward certification unless corrective
                            steps can be taken.</p>
                        <p>—We continue to stand ready to work with Iceland on developing and
                            improving its research program in an effort to find a solution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJF_1">Cooper</persName> said he believed that at
                            the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting the U.S. delegation
                            should vote on the basis of the facts. If a resolution critical of the
                            Icelandic program were to be introduced, he asked that the U.S.
                            delegation not lead the charge. We should leave open the option of a
                            solution if the Icelanders have the will to reach a compromise, he
                            said.</p>
                        <p>9. It was decided that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName>
                            would inform the Icelanders at the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            Meeting in New Zealand of U.S. concerns and willingness to cooperate
                            with Iceland in resolving the issues raised by the Scientific Committee
                            along the lines described in paragraph 8 above and that Ambassador Ruwe
                            would be instructed to make a similar demarche. It was also agreed that
                            the U.S. delegation at the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> meeting
                            would remain in close touch with Washington and keep the interagency
                            group apprised of developments there.</p>
                        <p>10. On the question of the proposed Norwegian scientific whaling program,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> said that the proposal
                            had been criticized at the meeting of the Scientific Committee in San
                            Diego. He did not, however, expect that a resolution against it would be
                            offered in New Zealand due to internal political maneuvers within the
                                <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> which involved Norway
                            supporting Sweden for the presidency of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CJF_1">Cooper</persName> pointed out that approval
                            of—or lack of a critical resolution on—the Norwegian program might have
                            a salutary effect on the Icelanders while disapproval could lead them to
                            conclude that no program, however well constructed, could receive <gloss
                                target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> approval. <persName corresp="#p_CJF_1"

                            <pb facs="1038" n="992" xml:id="pg_992"/> suggested that if an
                            anti-Norway resolution were proposed, the U.S. should abstain. <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWE_1">Evans</persName> took the point.</p>
                        <p>11. For Reykjavik: Charge should convey the points contained in paragraph
                            8 to appropriate senior levels of the Icelandic Government.<note n="9"

                        <p>The 1988 meeting of the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> was held May
                            30–June 3. Jerry Leach represented the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                                >NSC</gloss>. Unlike last year,<note n="2" xml:id="d347fn2"
                                >Regarding the June 1987 meeting, see <ref target="#d333fn14"
                                    >footnote 14, Document 333</ref>.</note> the meeting was
                            non-confrontational. The U.S. delegation did not lead the charge against
                            the Icelanders. The Icelanders reciprocated with a low-keyed
                            approach.</p>
                        <pb facs="1039" n="993" xml:id="pg_993"/>
                        <p>The meeting produced a consensus resolution which recognized progress on
                            Iceland’s part but nevertheless indicated that it had not gone far
                            enough in adhering to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>
                            guidelines. By implication, it called on Iceland (again) to refrain from
                            killing whales in 1988. That Iceland accepted this is an indication of
                            how much they wanted to avoid a collision at the meeting. (But we are
                            not sure that this means the <gloss target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> will
                            reduce or eliminate their whaling program.)</p>
                        <p>Iceland is now looking to us on the certification question. They let us
                            know very strongly that they do not want to be certified. Certification
                            alone, of course, has no practical effect as Icelanders do not fish
                            within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. However, the follow-up
                            sanctions—import restrictions against Icelandic fish products—bite hard
                            as fish are their primary exports and the U.S. is their primary market.
                            Unlike last year, the Icelanders made no threats of retaliation at this
                            meeting against U.S. interests in Iceland, especially Keflavik.
                            Nevertheless, those threats are still waiting in the wings if the
                            situation turns sour again.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> resolution and the equivocal
                            nature of this year’s scientific committee report on the Icelandic
                            whaling program give us some flexibility on the certification question.
                            We could choose not to certify because the Icelanders have been
                            responsive to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> and is making
                            improvements in its program. For example, they are currently killing 100
                            whales per year now as opposed to 500 in 1982 and 350 in 1985. However,
                            the compromise was predicated on an understanding that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI_1">GOI</gloss> would submit a scientifically sound
                            whaling program to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss> this year.
                            If we do not certify, a lawsuit from the environmental community is a
                            certainty. This fact worries <gloss target="#t_NOAA_1">NOAA</gloss> a
                            great deal because they have had one near miss before, a case like this
                            on Japan which they lost in the lower courts before the judgment was
                            overturned in the Supreme Court.<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d317fn5">footnote 5, Document 317</ref>.</note> One
                            outcome of a lost suit could be a court-directed certification, though
                            this itself would almost certainly be appealed by Justice.</p>
                        <p>The interagency group handling the issue is now considering the idea of
                            asking the Icelanders to further diminish their take and possibly make
                            some changes in their scientific research program in return for
                            non-certification. The interagency group will be seeking to come up with

                        <p>Dear Mr. Minister,</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to refer to discussions held in Reykjavik on June 18 and
                            19, 1988 between representatives of the Governments of Iceland and the
                            United States to discuss the Icelandic Program for Whale Research in the
                            context of the recent meetings of the International Whaling Commission
                                (<gloss target="#t_IWC_1">IWC</gloss>) and its Scientific Committee,
                            the bilateral discussions held in Ottawa on September 9, 1987,<note

                            and 9, 1988.<note n="5" xml:id="d348fn5">See <ref target="#d346fn7"

                        <pb facs="1041" n="995" xml:id="pg_995"/>
                        <p>My government understands that the results of those discussions are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>The representatives of Iceland made the following statements about
                            Iceland’s research program for 1988:</p>
                        <p>1. Up to 68 fin whales will be taken in 1988. This reduced number results
                            from the fact that the research program will begin at a later date in
                            1988 than in previous years.</p>
                        <p>2. Up to 10 sei whales will be taken in 1988. The reduced take of sei
                            whales will be for the purpose of research on cytogenetics, as
                            recommended by the Scientific Committee, and to continue energetics
                            research.</p>
                        <p>3. Iceland will increase its krill sampling and will optimize the timing
                            and methodology of the sampling in order to allow more effective
                            correlation of information on food and energetics of whales with
                            information on the biology of euphasiids on the whaling grounds.</p>
                        <p>4. Iceland will carry out the five specific scientific recommendations
                            concerning the Icelandic research program adopted by the scientific
                            committee at its San Diego meeting in May 1988.</p>
                        <p>The representatives of Iceland also stated that Iceland would address the
                            following matters in its report to the <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss> in 1989, pursuant to <gloss target="#t_IWC_1"
                                >IWC</gloss>/40/32.</p>
                        <p>1. The reasons why research on the ecological role of whales constitutes
                            a reasonable and necessary contribution to the comprehensive assessment
                            or a critical research need in its own right.</p>
                        <p>2. Contributions that the data gathered in 1986 and 1987 have made to
                            estimating the ages of recruitment, the ages at sexual maturity, the
                            pregnancy rates or other population parameters of fin and sei whales.
                            Analysis of trends that have been revealed by comparison of these recent
                            results with earlier data from commercial catches.</p>
                        <p>3. The inferences that can be drawn regarding the stock identities of fin
                            and sei whales in the North Atlantic from the electrophoretic and
                            biochemical analyses undertaken by Icelandic scientists.</p>
                        <p>Based on the foregoing understanding of the Icelandic research program
                            for 1988, and the fact that Iceland would address the matters enumerated
                            above, the United States agreed that the Icelandic program would not
                            diminish the effectiveness of the International Convention for the
                            Regulation of Whaling or its conservation program.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful if you would confirm that this is also the
                            understanding of the Government of Iceland.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>
