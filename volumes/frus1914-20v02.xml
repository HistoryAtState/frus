                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Referring to the
                            disposition to be made of the German refugee ships in American ports,
                            about which we conversed yesterday, I wish to set forth my further views
                            on the subject. They have the character of enemy private property within
                            the jurisdiction of a belligerent. It might be argued that inasmuch as
                            they are subsidized by the German Government and are more or less under
                            its control, they partake of the nature of enemy public property, which
                            is confiscable by the belligerent in whose possession it is found; but I
                            think this would be regarded as a strained interpretation of their
                            character, and I would, therefore, rather regard them as privately owned
                            enemy property. As to the disposition of enemy private property thus
                            situated, there are two views among authorities. According to the one
                            view, there is an obligation that they should be exempt from
                            confiscation except in the exigency of military necessity, public
                            safety, or reprisal. This is the European Continental view. According to
                            the Anglo-American view, the sovereign possesses the right to require
                            confiscation if this should be found necessary, but [it] leans toward a
                            general policy of exemption. The difference in effect between these two
                            views is not very great. In practice, however, nations as a rule seem to
                            recognize the exemption of private property as a policy which ought to
                            be followed save in exceptional cases.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, it has, I believe, become the modern custom to
                            requisition enemy private property when necessary upon the payment of
                            compensation. This is the rule agreed to by the nations at The Hague in
                            Convention Six, 1907,<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1">For text, see <hi
                                    rend="italic">The Second International Peace Conference</hi>,

                            relating to the status of enemy merchant ships at the outbreak of
                            hostilities. The United States, however, did not sign this Convention on
                            the ground, among others, that it did not give complete freedom for
                            vessels of the enemy in port at the outbreak of hostilities to depart.
                            As these vessels are generally so disabled as to be unable to depart,
                            and as they would be immediately seized on the ocean by Allied cruisers
                            if they did depart, <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0048"/>it seems this
                            policy of the United States need not interfere with any policy of
                            requisition which may be adopted.</p>
                        <p>It may be argued that the Treaties of 1828,<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2"

                            requisitioning the German refugee vessels: The only stipulation of these
                            treaties bearing on this point is Article 23 of the Treaty of 1799
                            providing that in case of war “The merchants of either country then
                            residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect
                            their debts and settle their affairs, and may depart freely, carrying
                            off all their effects without molestation or hindrance.” As most of the
                            German vessels are owned by non-resident German corporations, with only
                            operating agents here, only two or three vessels lying in our insular
                            ports being possibly owned by Germans residing there, it would seem that
                            this stipulation of the treaty would, as a practical matter, have little
                            application to vessels in United States ports. I have not exact data,
                            however, as to the resident ownership of these vessels.</p>
                        <p>As to the authority of the President to requisition the German ships
                            without an act of Congress, I have considerable doubt, except possibly
                            in the event that they are to be used directly in warlike operations, in
                            which case the President might be regarded as exercising his powers as
                            commander-in-chief. I have not had opportunity to examine this point
                            thoroughly.</p>
                        <p>I think that, outside of the purely legal questions involved, there is
                            strong moral right on our side in taking possession of these German
                            vessels and using them in our merchant marine. The German submarine
                            warfare has very materially decreased the shipping of the world and has
                            caused very serious embarrassment to this country in the matter of
                            transportation. I do not feel that we are bound to let these ships lie
                            idle in our ports while the tonnage of the world is being from day to
                            day reduced by the German Government. If you hold the same view as to
                            the matter, I have no doubt that the legal difficulties can all be
                            removed and the vessels can be repaired and sent forth with cargoes.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I must say that this
                            matter gives me grave concern. Undoubtedly we need the ships, and some
                            of them <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0049"/>could be got in shape for
                            use, no doubt, within a month or two, when, perhaps, they would be even
                            more needed than they are now; and yet I <hi rend="underline"
                                >despise</hi> the spirit of seizure.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as, so far as I know, they are not, at any rate immediately,
                            needed for military purposes, I take it from your memorandum that the
                            only course open to us is requisition for other transportation uses or
                            seizure by way of reprisal. I suppose either of these courses would
                            require authorization by the Congress (may I not have your advice on
                            that point?)</p>
                        <p>I believe that seizure <hi rend="underline">(ship for ship, for the
                                American ships sunk)</hi> by way of reprisal would, in the
                            extraordinary circumstances of this submarine warfare, be morally
                            justifiable. This would be confiscation and would hardly fall under my
                            general war powers.</p>
                        <p>I shall await your further advice on the points of law, domestic as well
                            as international, with the greatest interest.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In your note of April
                            8th you asked me whether the requisition of German ships for
                            transportation uses or the seizure of such ships by way of reprisal
                            requires authorization by Congress. In reply, I should say that both
                            requisition and reprisal, in the circumstances, require action by
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Reprisal is a well-established method in international practice by which
                            one nation obtains redress for injuries inflicted by another nation when
                            other means of satisfaction have failed. A reprisal in the nature of
                            seizure of property may amount to, and in this case I assume that it is
                            desired that it should amount to, confiscation of the property in
                            question. The confiscation of enemy private property within the
                            jurisdiction of the United States at or after the outbreak of war has
                            been in several cases held by the Supreme Court of the United States to
                            be contrary to “the modern usage of nations which has become law.” As
                            this usage of nations has thus been declared to be the law in the United
                            States, it is necessary to have Congress authorize the confiscation.
                            That such confiscatory acts by Congress are necessary is shown by the
                            history of the United States in the War of Independence and the Civil
                            War, when special acts of confiscation were passed—the Acts of August 6,
                                1861,<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn1">12 Stat. 319.</note> July 17,
                                1862,<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn2">12 Stat. 589.</note> the Joint <pb
                                n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0050"/>Resolution of same date,<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d3fn3">12 Stat. 627.</note> and the Act of March 3,
                                1863.<note n="8" xml:id="d3fn4">12 Stat. 758, 759, 762.</note>
                            Moreover, the Constitution delegates to the Congress the power to make
                            rules concerning “captures on land and water”, and power to grant
                            letters of marque and reprisal. It was the opinion of Jefferson, Clay,
                            and Gallatin that an act of Congress was necessary to vest in the
                            President authority for making reprisals.</p>
                        <p>As to requisitions of private property, I find no case in which, as
                            commander-in-chief, the President has requisitioned property of the
                            enemy within United States territory. Many cases of requisitions of
                            goods for the use of American forces have occurred, of course, but these
                            have been within territory occupied by the army in the Mexican and Civil
                            Wars. The right of requisition under military occupation is, I take it,
                            different from the right of requisition of goods in the United States
                            for commercial purposes in time of war. In the Mexican and Civil Wars,
                            goods were requisitioned without an Act of Congress by order of the
                            President as commander-in-chief, but receipts for the goods taken or
                            money payments were generally made, though the right was asserted that
                            requisition might be made without compensation. The Supreme Court of the
                            United States has held in cases coming before it that compensation must
                            be made for taking private property by the armed forces during military
                            occupation. There appear to be on the books no statutes giving the
                            President direct authority to requisition enemy property, and I am of
                            the opinion that such authority by Congress in the circumstances is
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>I have turned over to the War Trade Committee the task of drafting an
                            appropriate act to cover the seizure of German and Austrian ships, by
                            way of reprisal, ship for ship for the American ships sunk, and for
                            purposes of requisitioning the remaining ships.</p>

                                the only circumstance which seems now to stand in the way of an
                                absolutely cordial cooperation with Great Britain by practically all
                                Americans who are not influenced by ties of blood directly
                                associating <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0051"/>them with Germany
                                is the failure so far to find a satisfactory method of
                                self-government for Ireland. This appeared very strikingly in the
                                recent debates in Congress upon the war resolution and appeared in
                                the speeches of opponents of that resolution who were not themselves
                                Irishmen or representatives of constituencies in which Irish voters
                                were influential, notably several members from the South. If the
                                people of the United States could feel that there was an early
                                prospect of the establishment for Ireland of substantial
                                self-government a very great element of satisfaction and enthusiasm
                                would be added to the cooperation now about to be organized between
                                this country and Great Britain. Convey this information unofficially
                                of course but as having no little significance. Successful action
                                now would absolutely divorce our citizens of Irish birth and
                                sympathy from the German sympathizers here with whom many of them
                                have been inclined to make common cause.<note n="8a" xml:id="d4fn1"

                            what she has so often been promised, it would be felt that the real
                            programme of government by the consent of the governed had been adopted
                            everywhere in the anti-Prussian world.</p>

                            a good time to go forward with our Pan-American treaty with such

                            rather substantial advantage in having Brazil come in first, for the
                            German influence has been supposed to be stronger there, and the German
                            plans for immigration and control, more definite, than anywhere else in

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: Even though the
                            co-operation of the press has been generous and patriotic, there is a
                            steadily developing need for some authoritative agency to assure the
                            publication of all the vital facts of national defense. Premature or
                            ill-advised announcements of policies, plans and specific activities,
                            whether innocent or otherwise, would constitute a source of danger.</p>
                        <p>While there is much that is properly secret in connection with the
                            departments of the Government, the total is small compared to the vast
                            amount of information that it is right and proper for the people to
                            have.</p>
                        <p>America’s great present needs are confidence, enthusiasm and service, and
                            these needs will not be met completely unless every citizen is given the
                            feeling of partnership that comes with full, frank statements concerning
                            the conduct of the public business.</p>
                        <p>It is our opinion that the two functions—censorship and publicity—can be
                            joined in honesty and with profit, and we recommend the creation of a
                            Committee on Public Information. The Chairman should be a civilian,
                            preferably some writer of proved courage, ability and vision, able to
                            gain the understanding co-operation of the press and at the same time
                            rally the authors of the country to a work of service. Other members
                            should be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the
                            Secretary of the Navy, or an officer or officers detailed to the work by
                            them.</p>

                        <p>We believe you have the undoubted authority to create this Committee on
                            Public Information without waiting for further legislation, and because
                            of the importance of the task, and its pressing necessity, we trust that
                            you will see fit to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Committee, upon appointment, can proceed to the framing of
                            regulations and the creation of machinery that will safeguard all
                            information of value to an enemy, and at the same time open every
                            department of government to the inspection of the people as far as
                            possible. Such regulations and such machinery will, of course, be
                            submitted for your approval before becoming effective.</p>

                        <p>Your visit to Washington will accomplish much good not only because of

                        <p>The chief desire of this nation is to cooperate in the most efficient way

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Most of the things to
                            which this letter relates will have come to a head before it reaches
                            you, and you will probably know even without my telling you that a
                            number of those measures which appeared to have their origin in this
                            part of the world do not reach the proportions which are brought to your
                            attention without being directed and impelled. The whole question of
                            supply whether of money or of material, such as food, coal, steel, etc.
                            comes within the above list. The situation has become so imperative here
                            of late that a Commission of some kind is going over to America
                            immediately and I have just given the Minister of Transportation, Sr.
                            Enrico Arlotta, a letter of introduction to you, as he is going
                            immediately. I hope also that Marconi may go with him, or follow him
                            very closely as he stands for something international and is one of
                            those who has the broad view and understands profoundly how the
                            relations between the two countries should be strengthened in every way
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>You will have seen from my telegram<note n="11" xml:id="d9fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> that I have felt the great importance of some aid
                            being extended to Italy directly instead of through the medium of the
                            other Allies. There is no question that Italy feels most sensibly her
                            subjection in the present situation to both England and France,
                            especially the former, and that this is the moment in which she would do
                            much to be emancipated from this subjection, however measurably and
                            therefore will deal with America in a more liberal spirit than has
                            hitherto been found in our relations with her.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to suggest the Naturalization Treaty in any way as a
                            condition precedent to the aid which we may be able to extend her, but I
                            feel that it is not inappropriate to urge Italy to enter on negotiations
                            for this Treaty, and I have suggested it to Baron Sonnino and also to
                            several other Ministers with whom I have been brought in touch of late.
                            Baron Sonnino said that since we had entered the conflict on the side of
                            the Allies it would certainly seem easier to accomplish than before; for
                            this reason I am urging with as much earnestness as possible that this
                            Naturalization Treaty be put through and I have some hope of succeeding
                            in getting it done.</p>
                        <p>Quite irrespective of this however I trust very much that a Loan may be
                            made to Italy of as large an amount as may seem feasible along the lines
                            suggested by the Minister of the Treasury Sig. Carcano <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="pg_9" facs="0055"/>and also that, if possible, ships may be
                            furnished for the transport of American coal, grain and other products,
                            of which Italy stands at present in real need. I feel sure that if this
                            be done we shall be able hereafter to obtain our fair share of the
                            commerce of Italy instead of, as hitherto, being almost excluded
                            therefrom. I cannot emphasize too strongly the need which Italy has at
                            present of coal, grain, steel, corn, hay, sugar, etc.</p>
                        <p>I am sending a memorandum<note n="12" xml:id="d9fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            handed me yesterday or the day before by Sig. Arlotta, the Minister of
                            Transportation, showing that Italy absolutely needs 650,000 tons of coal
                            per month and that at present she is getting only about 400,000 tons.
                            Her normal consumption is about 800,000 tons per month. What she needs
                            also quite as much as coal is the ships to bring it here, and I
                            understand that this is one of the prime motives of Mr. Arlotta’s visit
                            to America.</p>
                        <p>When I get time I am going to send copies of a speech or two which I have
                            had an opportunity to deliver here in Rome and which I hope may have
                            some effect in opening the eyes of the Italian people to what America
                            stands for. They constitute a part of my general plan to try and
                            interpret America to the Italians as something of much more value to
                            them than they have hitherto been led to imagine. As a part of the same
                            programme I am organizing a sort of Intelligence Department for the
                            purpose of obtaining and collating all the information obtainable here
                            in every field which I think may be of value to us at home in our
                            endeavour to strengthen and make closer our relations. I have a good man
                            to place at the head of it, Mr. G. Speranza, who is an American of
                            culture and ability and whose articles may have attracted your attention
                            as they have appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Outlook</hi>, the New
                            York <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi> and perhaps other magazines. He
                            is an American of Italian parentage, his father having been a professor
                            at Columbia College. He has offered his services and I feel sure that we
                            can justify the outlay to which I referred in my telegram of yesterday
                            to you on this subject.<note n="12" xml:id="d9fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            The expense will be that of having a stenographer and typewriter and
                            getting material. I thought that it might be tried for at least a few
                            months in order to see how the plan works out.</p>
                        <p>I have been sending you in sections a report on the Mobilization of
                            Economic Resources of Italy and the Administration thereof under the
                            Extraordinary powers given the Government during the War.<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d9fn4">Not printed.</note> I have already sent one Section
                            on Coal (Fuel); one on Foodstuffs; one on Munition Factories and the
                            Industrial Mobilization connected therewith, and I am sending along with
                            this part V Sections 1 &amp; 2, the former being Legislation concerning
                            the Vigilance and Economic Treatment of Aliens in Italy, and Section 2,
                            being a report on the <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0056"/>Censorship.
                            I wish that the latter were in your hands now as I see that the question
                            of the Censorship of the Press is being much discussed at home.</p>
                        <p>Personally I am a great believer in a free press; I feel that it is the
                            true Palladium of Liberty. The Censorship which I believe in is that
                            which relates to military secrets; the censorship of the mails is also
                            of great importance; I refer to the mails for regions outside of the
                            country, censorship of which have [<hi rend="italic">has</hi>] proved of
                            great value.</p>
                        <p>I hope very much that these reports which I have taken much trouble with
                            are not filed for the benefit of future investigators into the archives
                            of our Government, but will reach duly the proper authorities for
                            consideration, especially as Italy’s handling of the question of spying
                            and of secret information seemed very complete.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: We ought to issue a
                            list of contraband. We are receiving inquiries in regard to the matter
                            and are unable to answer.</p>
                        <p>The Allied Governments have issued lists detailing numerous articles, the
                            lists being very long, increasingly long because of the constant
                            additions made from time to time.</p>
                        <p>After consideration of the subject it seemed to me that a general rather
                            than a detailed list of contraband could be issued which would not
                            require frequent change and consequent confusion.</p>
                        <p>If this method meets with your approval I would suggest the issuance of a
                            contraband list like the one enclosed. It covers I believe all the
                            articles included in the lists issued by the Allies, and at the same
                            time it will not require constant amendments as their lists have.</p>

                            that we should make an immediate announcement; but I am not clear as to
                            the meaning of all of the enclosed statement.<note n="14"

                        <p>No. 1 is clear. Under No. 2, is it your idea that all vehicles, of
                            whatever kind, should be considered contraband <hi rend="underline">no
                                matter whither bound</hi>? Under 3 I assume that the words “destined
                            to come into the possession or control of the enemy government or its
                            officers or agents” is meant to apply to “articles and materials for the
                            manufacture thereof” as well as to “all kinds of food and clothing”, but
                            the language does not make that clear. No. 4 is clear. Under 5 I assume
                            that it is meant only to include materials and metals useful in the
                            manufacture of coin, currency, etc., but the section might be read to
                            include all metals of all kinds and uses. Of course these points can all
                            be made clear. They do not go to the merits.</p>

                            understand that at the present time there is no bar to sending by mail
                            from the United States communications, plain or in cipher, from Germans
                            or German agents here, to Germans in Mexico or other neutral countries
                            for their information and transmission by various means to Germany and
                            her allies. The dangers to the country inherent in this form of
                            communication, are obvious—the present channel is open to the
                            transmittal of military information, transferrence of money and credit,
                            and manipulation of intrigues, etc. I enclose a copy of a memorandum of
                            the British Embassy dated April 12th<note n="16" xml:id="d12fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> pointing out the transference of German securities
                            to the nominal value of $1,250,000, by a letter of Kuhn-Loeb and
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances I have to suggest that a plan of censorship of
                            postal correspondence should be formulated at the earliest moment—in the
                            first instance by the Post Office Department which is familiar with our
                            postal laws and regulations, and later in cooperation with the State
                            Department and possibly the Department of Justice.</p>
                        <p>On April 20th I laid the urgency of this matter before the Postmaster
                            General but as I have not as yet received any indication as to the
                            attitude of his Department in the matter and as I regard the matter as
                            of the utmost importance I take the liberty of calling it to your
                            particular attention.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I think that we should
                            anticipate two moves on the part of Germany and be prepared to deal with
                            them promptly and decisively.</p>
                        <p>From our various sources of information, which are of course more or less
                            uncertain, it appears that Germany may in the near future directly or
                            indirectly through Austria outline terms of peace, which the German
                            Government practically declined to do. I do not believe that the terms
                            will be such that they can be considered nor do I think that they will
                            be bona fide. They will be made to influence public opinion in this
                            country and Russia.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0059"/>
                        <p>The other move on the part of the German Government will be to indicate
                            the success of democracy in Germany either by concessions by the
                            Government or by an apparent revolution carefully staged. This step will
                            also be taken to influence public opinion here and in Russia. It will of
                            course be artificial and manufactured for the occasion. I am convinced
                            that the sentiment for democracy in Germany is entirely under the
                            control of the Government, which will take every means to give it the
                            appearance of genuineness and the movement an appearance of irresistible
                            popular pressure.</p>
                        <p>I am writing of these possible, and I believe probable, steps by Germany
                            because it seems to be advisable to consider in advance the policy to be
                            adopted in meeting them. Would it be well to let the impression get
                            abroad through the press that Germany may possibly make such moves, but
                            that the American people ought not to be deceived as to their purpose,
                            which is of course to cause reaction against a vigorous war policy and
                            arouse false hopes of an early peace?</p>

                                xml:id="pg_14" facs="0060"/>in connection with the censorship of
                            mails brought to your attention in my note of April 30th. I am not doing
                            this in a controversial spirit or for any other purpose than to have the
                            whole situation laid before you, as I consider it to be of supreme
                            importance. Whatever may be the British facilities for censorship of
                            mails and telegraphs, and whatever may be the stringency of the American
                            censorship of telegraphs, it remains that there is by mail or courier to
                            Mexico and to South American countries an open channel for communication
                            of military information, of credit, and of intrigue, to the countries to
                            the south of us. This, in itself, is important, because we are aware of
                            German intrigue in Mexico, the flocking of thousands of Germans to that
                            country, probable German intrigues in Central America, and also in
                            certain countries of South America. There is, moreover, in these
                            countries, an effort on the part of Germans to build up German trade
                            after the war, which scheme is played up by German newspapers in order
                            to hearten the German spirit at the present time. Again, German raiders
                            have been operating off the South American coasts, and probably
                            obtaining some supplies from German firms in South America. It is very
                            probable that in the near future German submarines may endeavor to
                            undertake similar operations. The censorship of the mails to
                            Latin-American countries at least would assist very materially in
                            preventing or hindering the carrying out of any of the projects
                            mentioned. The matter came up for discussion yesterday at the conference
                            with Mr. Balfour, and he said that the importance of the information
                            obtained from censorship could not be overestimated and could not be
                            fully appreciated in advance.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, via South America there is direct means of
                            communication with Germany, which seems to me should be cut off. Mail
                            may be sent to South American countries from the United States and
                            transmitted from there by the diplomatic and consular officers of
                            Germany through devious channels of communication; or, I am told by Mr.
                            Balfour, direct to Spain by mail and possibly by cable (he was not sure
                            as to the cable), and thence by wireless from Spain to Germany. Mr.
                            Balfour said that this was a clear channel of communication still
                            open.</p>
                        <p>I trust you will understand that I am only desiring to inform you fully
                            on what to my mind is a very important matter. If it should turn out
                            that any censorship of mails is imposed by the United States, there
                            would, of course, be no duplication of the censorship by the Entente
                            Powers, as it would be arranged for them to pass mails censored by the
                            United States.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In our conference
                            yesterday with Mr. Balfour and members of his Commission on the subject
                            of export restrictions, he and Lord Percy called attention to the large
                            amount of commercial information which the British Government had
                            collected in regard to firms doing business in the neutral countries of
                            Europe—information which the British Government was using in
                            discriminating between persons in those countries to whom goods might
                            safely be allowed to be shipped, and another class of persons who were
                            merely channels of trade with Germany. Mr. Balfour thought that, in the
                            enforcement of the pending legislation for the control of exports, it
                            would be a great convenience, if not a necessity, to have the
                            information in London available to the United States, and he suggested,
                            as a means of keeping in touch with the British information, that a
                            person be designated by the United States to represent it in the War
                            Trade Intelligence Department in London.</p>
                        <p>I think that it is very important to follow out Mr. Balfour’s suggestion
                            in this respect, and I am calling the matter to your particular
                            attention for consideration. I think the representative should be
                            somebody from the United States who is familiar with general trade
                            conditions and with the policies of our Government. If you approve Mr.
                            Balfour’s suggestion, I will present some names for your consideration,
                            unless you already have some persons in mind.</p>
                        <p>I should add that, until the Exports Control Bill pending in Congress has
                            been passed, we will have no machinery for using the information from
                            London, in controlling exports from the United States.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I think it may interest
                            you personally to know that I received yesterday a telegram from home
                            saying that the recent submarine returns were rather less heavy and that
                            the reports of destruction of submarines were rather more numerous. Of
                            course these reports of destruction are highly problematical. The
                            telegram emphasizes that there is nothing to justify the belief that the
                            situation is less serious.</p>
                        <p>German resistance and counter-attacks are fiercely proceeding on the
                            Western front, but nevertheless the British offensive is being carried
                            on satisfactorily and methodically.</p>
                        <p>A conference held at Paris on May 4 and 5 showed that there was complete
                            agreement between the military experts of the two countries. I
                            understand that General Petain has practically taken the place of
                            General Nivelle. The Conference resulted in a definite understanding
                            that the war should be prosecuted with full strength along the whole
                            line. From the other theatres of war there were practically no
                            reports.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of Spain is still unsatisfactory, and Señor Maura’s speech,
                            which we mentioned in our conversation on Sunday, has given the Germans
                            a strong weapon which they are using to the utmost of their power.</p>
                        <p>Miliukoff<note n="18" xml:id="d18fn1">Russian Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> professes that he has prevailed against the Workmen
                            and Soldiers’ Committee, but the situation is still critical.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office report that the new Brazilian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs will only accept office on the condition that Brazil should
                            associate herself with the United States against Germany.</p>
                        <p>The position of the Ministry in France is said to be weaker. The French
                            Socialist minority have decided to send a representative to the
                            Socialist Conference in Stockholm. If the French Government agree to
                            allow this we shall probably have great pressure exercised on us from
                            our Socialist group to allow them also to send delegates. As I
                            understand there is also a question as regards delegates from the United
                            States I have telegraphed to the Foreign Office proposing that the
                            question should be discussed with Mr. Page and the French Ambassador in
                            London.</p>

                            the copy of Mr. Balfour’s letter to you of the ninth.</p>
                        <p>I do not like the movement among the Socialists to confer about
                            international affairs. They are likely to make a deal of mischief,
                            especially in connection with affairs in Russia. I think our own people
                            would warmly resent any encouragement by our government of the American
                            Socialists who may seek to take part, especially after their recent
                            almost treasonable utterances in their convention (at St. Louis, was it
                            not?). It is their own lookout what they do. We should neither give them
                            leave nor seek to restrain them. My own view is, that they will make
                            themselves either hated or ridiculous.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I had yesterday two
                            conversations in relation to Turkey which are worthy of consideration
                            because any possibility of alienating an ally of Germany ought not to be
                            ignored even if accomplishment is doubtful.</p>
                        <p>In the morning Mr. Elkus’<note n="19" xml:id="d20fn1">Abram I. Elkus,
                                Ambassador to Turkey.</note> private secretary (Mr. Alsberg, I
                            believe) called to see me and I spent some time questioning him as to
                            conditions in Turkey. He left Constantinople on April 6th and,
                            therefore, brought the latest information.</p>
                        <p>He said that the food situation was as bad as it could possibly be, that
                            he thought 200,000 people were starving in the city, and that in the
                            interior the condition was even worse; that the people were most anxious
                            for peace but without leadership could do nothing; and that all classes
                            were bitter against the Germans who were being gradually removed as
                            officers in the army.</p>
                        <p>He said that even the Government was becoming irritated at the arrogance
                            of the Germans and feared German control after the war; that they did
                            not want to become a vassal of Germany; that they saw in American
                            capital the only hope of rebuilding their ruined fortunes and desired to
                            remain on friendly terms but were compelled by the Germans to break off
                            relations, which increased Turkish ill-feeling <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18"
                                facs="0064"/>toward the German Government. Alsberg said that he
                            believed the Turks would listen to terms of a separate peace if they
                            dared.</p>
                        <p>I asked him what prevented them, and he replied the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Goeben</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Breslau</hi>, which were anchored
                            before Constantinople with their guns trained on the city, and that to
                            the Turks the preservation of Constantinople was the all-important
                            thing, that he believed that they would give up Palestine, Syria and
                            Armenia in order to hold Constantinople, even though it were under a
                            practical protectorate like Egypt.</p>
                        <p>He believed that it was possible, on account of the attitude of Turkey
                            toward the United States, for us to approach the Turkish Government with
                            suggestions for a separate peace, and that it might be brought about if
                            the German cruisers could in some way be destroyed by bombs or other
                            means.</p>
                        <p>When he spoke of the Turkish Government he referred of course to the
                            Triumvirs, Enver, Talaat and Djemel, who possess practically absolute
                            power. He felt that these three were beginning to chafe under German
                            control and to resent the insolent manner in which they were being
                            treated, while the possibility of rebellion among the Turks was
                            increasing as a result of the famine and suffering of the people.</p>
                        <p>I had been impressed with these statements, when Mr. Morgenthau<note
                                n="20" xml:id="d20fn2">Henry Morgenthau, Ambassador to Turkey,
                                1913–16.</note> came to see me in the afternoon and said that he had
                            been thinking over the situation and believed that the time was ripe to
                            make secret overtures to Turkey for he was sure that by this time the
                            Turkish leaders were heartily sick of their German masters.</p>
                        <p>I asked him why they submitted and he said that the cruisers and some of
                            the forts were in the hands of the Germans, which prevented the people
                            from acting against the Government, and the Government from acting
                            against the Germans. He said that he believed if the three Turkish
                            leaders were properly approached (meaning undoubtedly by bribery or
                            promises) he thought that they would allow some submarines to enter the
                            Dardanelles and destroy the German vessels, and that if that was done
                            and the Turks relieved of their fear of the Germans, they would be
                            willing to make peace on very favorable terms for the Allies.</p>
                        <p>I asked him how he would get in touch with Enver, Talaat and Djemel. He
                            replied that he believed that he could do it by going himself to
                            Switzerland where two members of the former Turkish Cabinet were at the
                            present time, men, whom he knew intimately, to whom he could talk
                            freely, and who would act as intermediaries. He said that he did not
                            court this service but was willing to under-take <pb n="19"
                                xml:id="pg_19" facs="0065"/>it if it seemed desirable. He suggested
                            that we (he and I) confer with Mr. Balfour on the subject. I told him
                            that I would think it over and if it seemed feasible would communicate
                            with him later.</p>
                        <p>Of course it would be a tremendous blow to the Central Powers to have
                            Turkey withdraw as no doubt Bulgaria would be forced to follow the same
                            course. But has this plan the slightest prospect of success? It seems
                            very doubtful, and yet, if the chance was one in fifty, I think it
                            should be taken, but has it that chance? Of course we could well afford
                            to spend a large sum to accomplish such a result. To make the attempt
                            would cost very little. Is it worth trying? That is, is it worth while
                            to send Morgenthau to Switzerland and let him make the attempt?</p>
                        <p>The other day I asked Mr. Balfour what chance he thought there was of
                            making a separate peace with Turkey. He replied that he had nothing very
                            definite on the subject, but that he had been advised that they were
                            “nibbling” and that Bulgaria was also.</p>
                        <p>This may be the opportune time, but I am not at all sure that it is. The
                            only thing is that I do not like to leave any stone unturned which will
                            lessen the power of Germany, and I have therefore felt that I should
                            submit the matter to you in detail for your consideration.</p>

                                necessary really for me to say much about either of the two
                                important foreign countries, America <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20"
                                    facs="0066"/>and Russia, at this moment, because about America
                                some of the gentlemen here have more direct knowledge than is
                                possessed by the Foreign Office. The Canadian representatives have a
                                knowledge of America which we hardly possess, while as regards
                                Russia we have already discussed the situation, and I think the
                                Cabinet understands it as well as anybody can understand this
                                rapidly moving cinematograph of Russian politics. The real thing
                                that is important to us I think is to know whether, if, as we hope,
                                the reasonable and moderate reformers win, they will be able
                                successfully to administer the country. If you look back upon
                                Russian history you will see that every great movement of reform has
                                come when the administrative inefficiency of the autocracy has been
                                followed by some great calamity. The Crimean War, which broke the
                                heart of Nicholas I. was immediately followed by the greatest of all
                                revolutions, the freeing of the serfs, and other great legal reforms
                                of the early reign of Alexander II The calamity of the Japanese War
                                was followed by the establishment of the Duma, and the
                                administrative disgraces of the present war are followed by the
                                revolution which is now going on before our eyes. But we have to
                                notice that while the general feeling of disgust and discontent with
                                the inefficiency of the autocracy has always been able to produce
                                these reforms, we have never had the opportunity of seeing whether
                                the democracy will be able to do what the autocracy utterly failed
                                to do, which is to administer this enormous country and to organize
                                it for purposes either of war or peace. The total failure of the
                                autocracy is amazing if you look back, and my fear is whether these
                                new people will do so much better than the old. In Russia there is
                                no middle class. Corruption has eaten deeply into their vitals and
                                we must not hope for too much. It seems certain, however, that they
                                cannot do worse than their predecessors. I think that is quite
                                clear.</p>
                            <p>The Central Powers, as we all know, have an enormous military
                                advantage over us in their central position. They have a
                                corresponding advantage from the point of view of their aims.
                                Germany dominates the aims of the whole of the coalition against us,
                                but none of the other Powers have aims which are inconsistent or
                                even divergent from those of Germany. Austria, for example, has, or
                                had, in the earlier days of the War, nothing except to gain by
                                German successes. Germany’s desire to press on in the East was not
                                only good for Germany but for Austria. Turkey, of course, was
                                promised hegemony in the farther East, which certainly, when it came
                                to the point, Germany would never have allowed her to exercise. But
                                Turkey felt that her objects were identical with Germany, so there
                                has been not only a central direction but a central motive. Now we
                                and our Allies, on the other hand, are not only not contiguous with
                                each other, but <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0067"/>we are as
                                widely separated as we well can be. Our most important Ally, next to
                                France, is Russia, and we cannot get at Russia. Even to take away a
                                single individual or a single mission from Russia is a matter which
                                the Admiralty has seriously to consider, and steps for which they
                                have to work out with the utmost caution. Japan is at the extreme
                                end of the world, we are separated geographically; but there is a
                                much more important separation, and that is the separation of
                                temperament, and the separation of history and tradition. It is
                                really an extraordinary thing on which to reflect that of the five
                                Great Powers now fighting on the Entente side, Japan and Russia were
                                in death grips about ten or eleven years ago. France and England
                                were on the edge of war more than once, and on more than one
                                subject, until the Entente arrangement was finally made in the year
                                1904. Italy was actually joined by treaty with the Central Powers as
                                a counterpoise to France and Russia, whilst we and Russia were
                                regarded as almost traditional enemies. I remember quite well in the
                                first days of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which started in
                                the year I think 1902 or 1903, we worked out the many problems with
                                which the Empire was then faced. What were they? How to prevent
                                Russia getting to India and how to deal with a war with France. That
                                was twelve or more years ago. Now the change which has been brought
                                about largely by German ambition backed by German diplomacy, which
                                is the worst diplomacy in the world, has welded all those nations
                                into one coalition determined to put down this world tyranny. We
                                have to accept the fact that residues of the old condition of things
                                must to a certain extent remain, and one of the diplomatic troubles
                                which we have to deal with for example, is the eternal jealousy
                                between Italy and France. It is curious that these two Latin
                                nations, one of which owes so much to the other because, without
                                France, Italy would hardly have gained her unity, in spite of that
                                they cannot get on with each other. We are the link between the two.
                                I think if you were to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty, he would
                                tell you that one of our difficulties in the Adriatic is that the
                                French will not work under the Italians. We ourselves are quite
                                ready to do so. We have sent ships to help them and our ships work
                                under an Italian Admiral; but the French will not do this. In the
                                Eastern Mediterranean there is jealousy at this moment which is
                                hampering our diplomacy, I do not say in a serious way, but it is
                                vexatious and irritating. Greece, which is the scandal of
                                contemporary diplomacy, is a scandal because three nations—the
                                French, the English and the Italians—are trying to manage her, all
                                of whom have divergent views. The Italians detest M. Venizelos—I do
                                not know why—but they appear to think that under M. Venizelos Greece
                                might attain to a position of influence in the Aegean Sea, which is
                                inimical <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0068"/>to the ambitions of
                                Italy. Merely as a characteristic mark of what is going on, the
                                Italians have been sending troops to Corfu, but nobody knows why. We
                                cannot get any explanation. The French say, “Cannot you send even a
                                corporal’s guard so that the British flag may be hoisted there as
                                well as the French, the Greek and the Italian.” Broadly speaking,
                                however, everything is working well with the exception of these
                                little elements of discord, which are very vexatious to the Foreign
                                Office but which I hope will not profoundly modify the general
                                course of the war.</p>
                            <p>I do not want to go at length into the question of Japan because that
                                is too large, but perhaps I ought to say a little about it. The
                                great Dominions and the United States of America are naturally, and
                                I think rightly, jealous of Japan’s obtaining any footing within
                                their territories. Japan on the other hand, at present quite
                                genuinely believes that what has been the sheet anchor of her policy
                                for the last twelve years, namely, the British alliance, is still
                                the sheet anchor of her present policy and they still cling to that.
                                Of course, we are talking quite privately and I do not think we can
                                conceal from ourselves that there is in every quarter of the Eastern
                                world a certain uneasiness as to whether Japan is in the future
                                going to try and play the part in those regions which Prussia has
                                played in Europe,—whether she is not going to aim at some kind of
                                domination. That fear hangs over the world. I do not venture to give
                                any opinion on that at all. Lord Grey held the view that if you are
                                going to keep Japan out of North America, out of Canada, out of the
                                United States, out of Australia, out of New Zealand, out of the
                                islands South of the Equator in the Pacific, you could not forbid
                                her to expand in China. A nation of that sort must have a safety
                                valve somewhere, and although I think Lord Grey carried his doctrine
                                to excess, I think there is something in it. I do not, however,
                                propose to touch further on this question.</p>
                            <p>As regards the War in the immediate future, I have myself no doubt
                                that Japan, with an eye to her own interests, is quite genuinely
                                helping the Allies, and helping the Allies to the best of her
                                ability. She is making money, unlike the rest of us, she is doing
                                well: but I do not think we ought to underrate the services she has
                                given or the services she is giving, and the present administration
                                so far as I can judge is incomparably more reasonable in its Chinese
                                policy than the ministry which immediately preceded it. They are
                                making great professions of leaving China to work out her own
                                salvation. Whether these professions will be carried out to the full
                                remains to be seen, but certainly I have not observed anything at
                                present which ought to inspire us with suspicion. I do not believe
                                suspicion is well placed. The only reason for which I mention that
                                    <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0069"/>is I am told that at this
                                moment the Germans still have hopes of detaching Japan. That
                                telegram which was sent to Mexico<note n="21" xml:id="d21fn1">
                                    <ref target="frus1917Supp01v01#pg_158">

                                        158</ref>.</note> and which produced all that excitement,
                                you remember, suggested that Mexico should act as an intermediary
                                between Japan and Germany. I do not know whether you have that in
                                your minds. The plan was to bring in Japan on the German side. I
                                believe that was one of Germany’s extraordinary blunders which she
                                is always making, and I do not myself look forward with the least
                                apprehension to anything that Japan is likely to do during the
                                course of the War.</p>
                            <p>If I turn from these considerations, which affect the Allies, to the
                                diplomatic relations between the Allies and the Central Powers other
                                than the immediate military relations between the Allies and the
                                Central Powers, the most important question is,—are the Terms of
                                Peace to which we are committed of a kind which are unnecessarily
                                going to prolong the War? There is no doubt that Germany, as we have
                                heard today, is in very great peril. How are they keeping up the
                                spirits of their people? They are keeping them up in two ways. They
                                are saying in the first place that England will succumb under the
                                submarine warfare. They are saying in the second place, “You must go
                                on fighting at whatever sacrifice, because, if you do not win, our
                                enemies are determined not merely to beat us but to destroy us”; and
                                every nation worth anything, of course, will fight to the last crust
                                of bread and to the last cartridge, if its actual destruction is
                                going to be the result of an unsuccessful war.</p>
                            <p>The practical destruction of the Turkish Empire is undoubtedly one of
                                the objects which we desire to attain. The Turks may well be left—I
                                hope they will be left—in a more or less independent position in
                                Asia Minor. If we are successful unquestionably Turkey will be
                                deprived of all that in the larger sense may be called Arabia; she
                                will be deprived of the most important portions of the Valley of the
                                Euphrates and the Tigris; she will lose Constantinople; and Syria,
                                Armenia and the southern parts of Asia Minor will, if not annexed by
                                the Entente Powers, probably fall more or less under their
                                domination.</p>
                            <p>If we turn from Turkey, however, to Austria, the position is somewhat
                                different. According to rumours, which you must all have heard,
                                Austria is so exhausted that she would desire to have a separate
                                peace; but, again, one of the difficulties about a separate peace is
                                what, by the terms as interpreted in our Note to President
                                    Wilson,<note n="22" xml:id="d21fn2">

                                left of Austria if we do make a separate peace? We have entered into
                                treaties with Italy, Roumania and Serbia, all of which affect
                                Austrian territory. Italy, who came into the war in <pb n="24"
                                    xml:id="pg_24" facs="0070"/>April, I think it was, of 1915,
                                opened her mouth rather widely: that is Italy’s way; and she not
                                only got the Allies to promise her <hi rend="italic">Italia
                                    Irredenta</hi>, the populations bordering upon her frontier, who
                                are of Italian origin, speak Italian and possess Italian culture,
                                but she asked also for parts of Dalmatia which neither
                                ethnologically nor for any other valid reason can be regarded as a
                                natural part of Italy. Her justification, however, was not
                                ethnological, it was purely military, or rather, naval. Italy is
                                very unfortunately situated in the Adriatic; she possesses the whole
                                of the western seaboard of that sea, but along her coasts from
                                Venice to Brindisi there really is nothing which deserves to be
                                called a harbour at all. But opposite, threatening her, within easy
                                striking distance and within a few hours’ steam, there is the coast
                                of Dalmatia with its islands and it harbours contrived by nature to
                                suit modern submarine warfare, and it is most natural that Italy
                                should say: We should like, in our own interests and for our own
                                protection to possess this coast. Except from that military point of
                                view I am not aware that it is easy to justify handing over the
                                Dalmatian coast, which is not Italian, to Italy. But there it is, it
                                is in the Treaty to which we are bound. We, the French, the Russians
                                and the Italians, are bound to each other never to make peace
                                without the other, and among the conditions which we have mutually
                                promised are these cessions of territory which so far as Italy is
                                concerned I have just described.</p>
                            <p>If you turn to Serbia, we promised Serbia Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
                                I think that it is a most legitimate promise. They are of the same
                                race, of the same language, and of the same religion. They are not
                                old provinces of Austria; they were Turkish provinces up to the
                                Treaty of 1878 in the full sense of the word, and after 1878 until
                                1908 when Austria broke through the Treaty of Berlin they were still
                                Turkish provinces in name, though not in administration or in any
                                other substantial sense. Still, they are not old provinces of
                                Austria and if Austria lost them nobody could say that Austria was
                                destroyed. If you go a little further north and ask how you are
                                going to treat the Slav population which also speaks the same form
                                of Slav language, the Croat and other Slav communities to the south
                                of the Danube you undoubtedly are going to make a great breach in
                                the traditional Austrian Empire. But I am not aware that we are by
                                treaty bound in any sense to do that.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: I do not see that so far as

                                the sort of peace we liked it could be said that we had destroyed
                                Austria, certainly not the historic Austria, the Austria of the 18th
                                century, in any sense of the word at all.</p>
                            <p>When you come to our promises to Roumania and our promises in
                                connection with Poland, in connection with which I shall speak
                                presently, the case is different. We promised Roumania, if she came
                                in, that that part of Hungary which is predominantly Roumanian in
                                race and in language should be handed over to Roumania. There are
                                people who say that there are Roumanians in Hungary who do not wish
                                to be handed over to Roumania. I do not know whether that is true or
                                not; I should doubt it. But at all events it is undeniable that to
                                take away the Roumanian part of Hungary, namely Transylvania, and
                                hand that to Roumania is to break up historic Hungary. That does
                                touch the historic kingdom of Hungary.</p>
                            <p>As regards another historic Kingdom with an important past, Bohemia.
                                Bohemia is predominantly Slav in language and in civilization. It
                                differs of course from the Southern Slavs, from the Serbs, for
                                instance, in being Roman Catholic in religion and in speaking a
                                language of a variety of Slav which is very different from that
                                spoken by their brothers further South. It has a history and a
                                tradition of its own. It has been quite abominably used by Austria
                                in this war. If all accounts are true Bohemia has a hatred of German
                                civilization and German propaganda which is intense and I think
                                inextinguishable. Whether, however, all those feelings could not be
                                adequately satisfied by giving Bohemia some form of autonomy in the
                                Austrian Empire I am not so clear. I happened to meet a few months
                                before his assassination with the poor man who was the beginning of
                                all our troubles. He was then heir to the Austrian Throne, and he
                                had a view that the only way to keep Austria together was to make it
                                a triple State instead of a dual State.</p>
                            <p>At present it is a dual State which is the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
                                He wanted to make a third element in the Empire, namely a Southern
                                Slav. It seems to me that if you made it a quadruple Empire and gave
                                Bohemia autonomy, it would be a very curious construction, but not
                                more curious than Austria has been through all these centuries and
                                it might really meet the views of the populations without absolutely
                                destroying Austria as history knows it. But I am afraid that does
                                not touch the Roumanian difficulty. I do not see any way out of that
                                at present.</p>
                            <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0072"/>
                            <p>With regard to Poland, I do not think you can call the Polish part of
                                Austria—in fact, it would be absurd to call it a part of historic
                                Austria; it became Austrian because Frederick the Great, Catherine
                                II, and Maria Theresia chose to cut up Poland and divide it among
                                themselves. Galicia is not part of historic Austria, and might and
                                ought to go to the Poland of the future. But what is the Poland of
                                the future? That, I think is now, as it has been ever since the
                                great crime of partition was accomplished, the greatest crux of
                                European diplomacy. A very distinguished Pole came to see me
                                yesterday, whose name I will not even venture to pronounce, (Lord R.
                                Cecil: Mr. Dmowski<note n="23" xml:id="d21fn3">Roman Dmowski,
                                    President of the Polish National Committee.</note>) but he is a
                                man of very high character and great position. He is an ardent
                                advocate for a completely independent Poland which should include
                                all the Poles. But, I asked him: “What relations does the Poland
                                that you desire, the Polish Poland that you desire created, bear to
                                the Poland of 1772, the year of the first partition?” “Well”, he
                                said, “I quite agree you cannot precisely follow those old
                                frontiers”. Part of what was then Poland is more Russian than
                                Polish—the Eastern part of it—and we could not ask that it should be
                                taken from Russia and handed over to Poland. On the other hand,
                                there is a part of Upper Silesia which had been taken from ancient
                                Poland before the partition; Frederick the Great, in fact, took it
                                from Austria. “That”, he said, “is quite genuinely Polish”. I think,
                                he said, 80% of the inhabitants of the Polish area of Silesia were
                                Poles by birth and Poles by language; and in his view that ought to
                                be added to Poland. Then I said to him, “Well, what about Dantzig?”
                                Dantzig, as you will remember, is one of the old Hanseatic towns,
                                and undoubtedly, subject to its municipal independence, it was part
                                of the Polish kingdom. But I suspect, myself, it has been
                                practically German for many centuries; it is certainly predominantly
                                German at this moment. The country immediately around it, or a great
                                deal of the country in its immediate neighbourhood, is just as
                                Polish as other parts of Poland; at any rate, more than 50% are
                                Poles. But here comes the difficulty. He said, without Dantzig,
                                Poland is impossible. Dantzig is the one outlet, the one adequate
                                outlet to the sea, which the restored Poland would have, and unless
                                you are prepared to give back Dantzig to Poland it is useless to try
                                and create a really flourishing modern State. Of course, you will
                                remember Dantzig belonged to Poland at the time of the Partition. In
                                fact, it belonged to Poland after the first Partition. Frederick the
                                Great was content not to take it at that time because he said, with
                                great truth, that “Anybody who has the Vistula, or the upper waters
                                of the Vistula, will become in time the owner of Dantzig”; <pb
                                    n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0073"/>as indeed he did become; but
                                still, I think everybody must admit that to take away Dantzig from
                                Germany would be to deprive Germany of a town which is predominantly
                                German; but if you have the map in your mind, it cuts off
                                Königsberg, and all East Prussia from the rest of the Prussian
                                State, and therefore undoubtedly that is a thing which would touch
                                German emotions and German interests very quickly. Königsberg and
                                East Prussia would become a kind of enclave, separate from Germany,
                                but remaining German, embedded in a Polish and Russian framework.
                                The difficulties of that are very great, but you see you are in a
                                dilemma, according to my friend, whether Poland is absolutely
                                independent, as he desires, or whether it becomes an autonomous
                                State, bound more or less closely to Russia. However that may be,
                                whether you include Dantzig or not, any idea to make a Poland which
                                does not include Posen is, in his view, destroying Poland. On the
                                other hand, Posen is, at present, a very integral part of Germany,
                                and Germany, no doubt, would feel that if Posen were taken by a
                                Power which was potentially a great power it would bring it very
                                close up to the gates of Berlin. And yet, supposing we are
                                successful, can we allow this war to come to an end without doing
                                something substantially to get rid of the Polish scandal? It is true
                                that Poland brought it upon herself. If Poland had understood the
                                elements of reasonably good government, the idea that she could be
                                partitioned like an inert mass, as she was, is out of the question.
                                But that is in the past, and it is quite possible that the Poland of
                                the future will be a useful member of the European community; but
                                until she is satisfied you will have this nucleus of bitter
                                discontent, and a nation going back to great and glorious memories,
                                when it was the most powerful State in Eastern Europe. I frankly
                                admit that when the Germans say that we are fighting for a cause
                                which means their destruction, it is not true in one sense; we are
                                not destroying a German Germany, but we are trying to destroy the
                                rather artificial creation of the modern Prussia, which includes
                                many Slav elements which never belonged to Germany until about 140
                                years ago, and ought, really, not to belong to Germany at this
                                moment.</p>
                            <p>I am afraid I am merely stating difficulties; I am sorry to say I am
                                not solving them. If we are not successful in the war, there is no
                                hope of solving them. If the war is a drawn battle, these great
                                causes, I am afraid, will never be satisfactorily dealt with by us.
                                If we win triumphantly, then we shall be able to deal with them. Let
                                me return for a moment to my Polish friend. He urged me very
                                strongly to make a public appeal now on behalf of Poland. “Now”,
                                said he, “that the Tsar has gone, the Entente Nations ought to
                                announce publicly that they are going to establish an independent
                                Poland; and if you <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0074"/>do not do
                                that”, he said, “there is great danger that the Germans may succeed
                                in the future in doing what they have failed to do in the past,
                                which is to raise a Polish army”.</p>
                            <p>His view was, that the recruiting of this Polish army had largely
                                failed because the magnates whether ecclesiastical or lay in Poland
                                had taken the oath of allegiance to the Tsar and were not prepared
                                to break it. The Tsar has gone, the oath has gone, and he declared
                                that his view was that the constant pressure of Germany, after this
                                particular doubt had been removed, might succeed in producing this
                                great addition to her man-power. If it did, the effect upon the
                                Allied cause would undoubtedly be most serious. He put the numbers
                                down at between 700,000 and 1,000,000. Supposing Poland came in, in
                                that way, on the side of the Central Powers, and supposing Russia
                                fell into disorganization and military chaos, the whole of the
                                position in the East would be changed disastrously for the worse.
                                Whether we are in a position to proclaim our intentions with regard
                                to Poland and whether, if we did, it would have the effect which he
                                says, I do not know; I think, very likely, it would. I put this
                                question to him: “The Tsar has gone, and with the Tsar one obstacle
                                may have gone, but can you ask this new Russian Government to begin
                                its career by handing over what the Russians regard as an
                                indisputable part of their territory?” He seemed to think it would
                                be possible. I confess I have my doubts. I am sending an account of
                                this conversation to Sir George Buchanan<note n="24" xml:id="d21fn4"
                                    >British Ambassador to Russia.</note> and I shall be interested
                                to hear what he says about it.</p>
                            <p>Personally, from a selfish Western point of view, I would rather that
                                Poland was autonomous under the Russians, because if you make an
                                absolutely independent Poland, lying between Russia and the Central
                                States, you cut off Russia altogether from the West. Russia ceases
                                to be a factor in Western politics, or almost ceases. She will be
                                largely divided from Austria by Roumania. She will be divided from
                                Germany by the new Polish State; and she will not be coterminous
                                with any of the belligerents. And if Germany has designs in the
                                future upon France or the West, I think she will be protected by
                                this new State from any action on the part of Russia, and I am not
                                at all sure that that is to the interests of Western civilization.
                                It is a problem which has greatly exercised my mind, and for which I
                                do not see a clear solution. These are disjointed observations in
                                regard to Poland; they lead to no clear-cut recommendation on my
                                part. I am not pleading for a cause; I am trying to lay before the
                                Cabinet the various elements in the problem as they strike me.</p>
                            <p>The next branch of the subject on which I have anything to say is the
                                smaller neutrals.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Robert Borden</hi>: “Is there any point
                                about Belgium?[”]</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: With regard to Belgium, I
                                think I can very shortly describe the position to the Cabinet. It is
                                more an economic than a diplomatic problem. I take it, that whatever
                                we fight for, we fight for the restoration of Belgium to her old
                                limits and her old condition of independence and prosperity. The
                                Belgian Minister has more than once been to see me and has put to me
                                this problem. He says: “All of us, every nation, will, after the
                                War, have to face a whole series of new and difficult questions,
                                social, economic, military; the upsetting of everything is so
                                complete, that there is not a nation in the world that will not have
                                to face a new set of things, and do their very best to solve the
                                problem raised.” All that is true of Belgium. But what is true of
                                Belgium is true to some extent of no other country. Unless the
                                Allies will, while the war is going on, make preparation to help
                                Belgium, when peace comes, even though its independence be restored
                                and its old frontiers established, she will be left derelict; it is
                                an industrial community, thickly populated, depending for its very
                                livelihood and bread for its people upon mining and upon
                                manufactures. The Germans have not only over-run the country, but
                                they have taken away all the machinery, all the raw material, they
                                have practically taken away everything for the carrying on of the
                                elementary economic effort of the country, and it is impossible for
                                Belgium to make itself again a going concern unless the Allies are
                                prepared at the moment of peace, at the first moment possible, to
                                pour in the raw material, to supply the machinery to make Belgium,
                                in other words, something like what it was before the Germans
                                overwhelmed it. I have no answer to that; I believe what he said is
                                perfectly true, and I believe the appeal which the Belgian Minister
                                makes to the Allies is one which ought to be considered. We are
                                overwhelmed with work; my office can do nothing; I am not sure what
                                office ought to do it. So great is the pressure that I have not had
                                time to put this case before the Prime Minister and our smaller
                                Cabinet. I only circulated an account of my conversation with the
                                Belgian Minister, but the question must be raised and it must be
                                faced. I think it is one of the most important things, outside the
                                war itself, but how it is to be done, other Ministers and other
                                Departments must say.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Joseph Ward</hi>: In regard to that
                                restoration of machinery, do you mean prior to the re-building of

                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: I think we ought to be ready
                                to pour it into the country if we can.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">The Prime Minister</hi>: It is impossible for
                                the simple reason that all our available manufacturing capacity is
                                put to urgent war work. If we have anything to spare, we put it into
                                agricultural work.</p>

                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: Perhaps I should add that in
                                my view, the notion which is going through the German mind that they
                                can restore Belgian independence enough to satisfy the world, and
                                yet keep a grip upon Belgian economic life and Belgian ports, I
                                regard as absolutely inadmissible. I think that is almost as bad as
                                annexing Belgium, and I would fight against it to the last drop of
                                my blood. I do not think that is arguable.</p>
                            <p>As regards the Neutrals—the small Neutrals I mean—Sweden and Royalist
                                Greece, which must be regarded as more or less hostile, Spain and
                                Holland, which I think are friendly, but more doubtful, Norway and
                                Denmark, which are certainly very weak, especially Denmark—there is
                                a great deal of important diplomatic work and Foreign Office work
                                done with these countries; but most of that work really belongs to
                                my colleague, the Minister of Blockade, and measured by telegrams it
                                is far greater, I believe, than that of all the other Offices of
                                State put together; but he will make a statement upon the subject. I
                                do not believe I have anything more to say except this one
                                observation.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Austen Chamberlain</hi>: Are you going to
                                say anything more about German aims in the Middle East and their
                                consequence to us?</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: I feel intensely upon that
                                question. It was referred to, I think, by the Prime Minister in his
                                statement the day before yesterday, but I am quite ready to say
                                something about it if you think it desirable. This War has been
                                described, and quite accurately I think, as a war against the world
                                domination of Germany, but I think that Germany after all was not
                                equally anxious to have world domination in every direction at one
                                and the same time. What Germany wanted to do was not to make every
                                country equally subservient to her economic designs; I think her
                                economic ambitions in these later years were largely directed, not,
                                of course, wholly, but largely directed to developing the
                                communications between Germany, through Austria, through subordinate
                                States like Bulgaria and Turkey to the Persian Gulf and ultimately
                                to India and the Far East. All the German literature of the last ten
                                years is full of these dreams. Germany has borrowed a great deal
                                from Napoleon, almost always the worst things of Napoleon’s. These
                                are the dreams and they have eaten very deeply into the social
                                imagination of the whole community. They picture to themselves Asia
                                Minor, the Valleys of the Euphrates and the Tigris and beyond, India
                                and the East; they picture that as a happy field where German
                                enterprise can reign undisturbed. They found Great Britain and the
                                United States had got before them in entirely new countries. South
                                America they were nibbling at, but they had never made up their
                                minds to deal with it. But they thought they had a really fair field
                                in these Oriental regions, and I believe that it was within their
                                power to do it. I believe that if they were successful in this war,
                                they would do it <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0077"/>and that
                                their success would undoubtedly adversely affect the British Empire.
                                I will not say the British Empire would fall, I do not think it
                                would, but it would have a very severe struggle for existence and
                                the whole balance of the world’s trade and the world’s power would
                                be altered. The Dominions like Australia and New Zealand would be in
                                an entirely different position from what they are now. India would
                                be in an entirely different position from what it is now, and I am
                                not at all sure that among the dangers of German domination, which
                                every country has to fear, the particular dangers that arise through
                                their being able to establish an unbroken avenue of influence from
                                the North Sea to the Persian Gulf is not the greatest of all. I
                                think whatever else happens in the war, that recent events have
                                upset that dream, and I do not think that things could possibly go
                                so badly that Germany could piece together the scattered fragments
                                of this structure which they are striving to complete. In that
                                particular I think we have been successful. I wish I could feel that
                                our success was as complete in other fields of operations and that
                                we could look forward with equal confidence to breaking the designs
                                of Germany in Europe as I hope we have been now in breaking her
                                designs in Turkey and the Middle East generally.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Massey</hi>: Can you tell us anything with
                                regard to the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine?</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: The importance of Alsace and
                                Lorraine is two-fold. In the first place, if we could transfer them
                                back to France we should, I think, do something to improve the
                                equilibrium of Europe. You would remove a population which does not
                                wish to be under Germany to France which it does wish to be under.
                                You would further increase the population of France relative to the
                                population of Germany, which undoubtedly must make for the
                                equilibrium of Europe, and because it makes for the equilibrium of
                                Europe, makes also for the peace of the world. Then there is another
                                point. Since Alsace and Lorraine were taken by Germany, means have
                                been found to utilise the great iron deposits of Lorraine to an
                                extent which makes them a very formidable adjunct to Germany’s
                                industrial power. I frankly admit that I should very much like to
                                see these great fields of industrial enterprise restored to their
                                original owners. Germany’s strength in coal and steel is an
                                absolutely new phenomenon, you must remember, since the war of 1870,
                                and it is one of the most formidable factors in her success in this
                                War.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">The Prime Minister</hi>: And it is one you
                                cannot touch by the Blockade.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Balfour</hi>: I was told that when the war
                                broke out, Germany had a greater power of producing munitions at the
                                moment than the whole of the rest of the world put together. She
                                owed that, of <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0078"/>course, partly
                                to her desire to be prepared in a military sense, but partly to
                                these enormous resources which she has developed since 1870, of
                                which the iron and coal fields west of the Rhine are an important
                                part and, therefore, from that point of view as well as from the
                                more strictly political and diplomatic point of view, I should be
                                most desirous to see Alsace and Lorraine restored to France. I am
                                told that the French are not so eager about them as they were. Or
                                let me put it rather differently; I am told that the war-weariness
                                in certain sections of French society in consequence of their
                                terrific losses and the general burdens which the war has thrown
                                upon them are so great that if they could get an honourable peace,
                                even without Alsace and Lorraine, or even a small fragment of Alsace
                                and Lorraine, they might be content to take it. I should be very
                                disappointed if this War ends without the complete restoration of
                                the ancient frontiers of France.</p>
                            <p>The only other thing I have to say is that German atrocities have
                                really had an important diplomatic effect. I think that when Lord
                                Robert Cecil comes to speak, he will tell you how great an effect
                                upon allied diplomacy has been the terrorism which Germany has
                                inspired and produced in Holland, Denmark and Norway. These
                                countries are trembling at the German terrorism. They hate Germany,
                                they hate the domination of Germany, but they feel that if they
                                quarrel with Germany, they will be as Belgium is, and that is
                                undoubtedly a very great diplomatic weapon in the hands of Germany.
                                It is painful to have to admit it, but I think it is true.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">The Prime Minister</hi>: I am sure we are very
                                much obliged to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for his
                                most illuminating exposition. I do not know whether any members of
                                the Cabinet would like to ask any further questions.</p>

                            with Morris Hill-quit, the socialist, who is seeking a passport to go

                            understand that the British are greatly disturbed over it and are
                            disposed not to issue passports to their socialists who wish <pb n="33"
                                xml:id="pg_33" facs="0079"/>to attend and that the French have the
                            same view. They feel if we issue passports to our socialists that they
                            will be forced to do the same.</p>
                        <p>The question is shall we issue passports to men who are avowedly going to
                            the Conference. If we refuse, it may make them martyrs. If we do issue
                            them, we may encourage a dangerous pro-German movement and permit
                            agitators near Russia who are frankly hostile to the Commission to
                            Russia and will seek every means to discredit it and weaken their

                            before you at the present time a certain bill, or bills making it a
                            criminal offense for anyone to use without authorization a telephone
                            wire in the State to obtain information.</p>
                        <p>While I would not presume to advise you in this matter I hope that you
                            will give very careful consideration to the effect which such
                            legislation would have on the investigations and collection of
                            information by federal agents at the present time when national safety
                            requires extraordinary measures, which would not be justified or
                            tolerated under normal conditions. Of course the supreme purpose of all
                            federal and state authority at this critical period should be to
                            increase, rather than to obstruct the exercise of governmental
                            powers.</p>

                            approved, but I thought in view of the mass of measures which you are
                            required to pass upon at this time I would direct your attention to
                            proposed laws which materially affect the activities of our federal
                            agents.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Senator Owen called to
                            see me yesterday and left with me a copy of a resolution which he had
                            drafted and which is embodied in a speech which he proposes to deliver
                            in support of the resolution.<note n="27" xml:id="d26fn1">No enclosures

                                94, introduced by Senator Owen, and his remarks on the subject, see

                        </p>
                        <p>While he did not say so I assume that he wished me to submit it to you
                            for comment as to the desirability of introduction at the present and as
                            to the terms of the resolution.</p>
                        <p>I did not have time to read the Senator’s speech until today. I think
                            that it is based on the essential principles which will be the
                            foundation of a permanent peace, but I am not at all sure that this is
                            the time to invite controversy over the terms of peace in Congress and,
                            as a consequence, throughout the world. I am not sure how the various
                            Allied Governments would view this formal declaration on our part of
                            arrangements, in which they are so vitally interested, without <pb
                                n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0081"/>our consulting them or giving
                            them an opportunity to object to one or more of the provisions.</p>
                        <p>In fact I believe that any resolution at the present time would
                            precipitate a debate in Congress which might give opportunity to those
                            hostile to you to criticize your declarations as to the purposes which
                            we seek to accomplish in the war. That would be very undesirable and
                            might cause serious differences with our co-belligerents.</p>
                        <p>I do not know quite how to explain this to Senator Owen who has evidently
                            given much thought to the subject and is strong in the belief that
                            Congress should declare our purposes. I am afraid that my objection
                            alone would not restrain him from acting.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the best way is for you to ask Senator Owen to come
                            and see you, and then give him orally your views rather than write them
                            to me for transmission to him.</p>
                        <p>I will tell the Senator that I have sent you his resolution and speech
                            for your consideration.</p>

                            the Poles for the restoration of Poland as an independent nation.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>It seems to be recognized by all the Allies that Polish independence
                            should be one of the results of the war and that the Poles should as far
                            as possible be segregated into military units so that they would feel
                            their nationality and be inspired to fight for the freedom of their
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It is my understanding that France, has already taken steps to form a
                            skeleton on which to build up a Polish army to fight on the Western
                            front; and that something of a like nature could be organized on the
                            eastern front. This latter plan will require discreet handling because
                            the Russians may be at first loath to release troops already
                            incorporated in the Russian armies, but I think that it can be done by
                            starting with a movement to call Poles not already in military service
                            to join a Polish army for independence. When this step is taken I
                            believe the separation of the Poles in the Russian armies will follow as
                            a matter of course.</p>
                        <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>To gain the full benefit of the loyalty of the Poles to their country it
                            seems to me that, in the first place, this government and those of the
                            Allies should announce in separate but identic declarations that they
                            recognize the legitimate nature of Polish desire for self-government and
                            that they purpose to devote their energies to free Poland and restore
                            the nation to full sovereignty, in contradistinction to a nation under
                            the protection or control of any neighboring power.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, the matter of financing the Polish military
                            establishment is most important. Of course it will have to be done by
                            this country. My suggestion is that a Polish Provisional Government [be]
                            set up in this country, that it be recognized by this Government and the
                            Allied Governments, and that it send diplomatic representatives to all
                            the powers with which it is associated in the war. After formal
                            recognition of this Government of an independent Poland we could legally
                            loan the Government for military purposes the necessary funds secured by
                            Polish bonds underwritten by this country and the Allies.</p>
                        <p>I have carefully considered the place where the Provisional Government
                            should be located and have come to the conclusion that to avoid all
                            suspicion as to the genuine purpose of this step looking to the rebirth
                            of Poland this country is the only place. Furthermore, in view of the
                            fact that this country will have to supply the money for this
                            enterprise, I believe that the new Government should be where we can
                            keep a watchful eye on the expenditures.</p>
                        <p>If this plan or one along the same lines meets with your approval, shall
                            I sound the diplomatic representatives of the Allies on the subject?</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I think it may interest
                            you to have some of my impressions after a week in England. I am much
                            struck but not in any way surprised to find that, so far as a casual
                            observer can see, whatever stirring there may be on the part of a small
                            if noisy element, the people at large are overwhelmingly firm in their
                            determination to stand by the Government and to see it through to the
                            end. I feel sure, however, that my friend and colleague here, who knows
                            England thoroughly, keeps you informed as to everything that is
                            important.</p>
                        <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0083"/>
                        <p>Baron Sonnino’s visit to London, accompanied by the Under Secretary of
                            Foreign Affairs, de Martino, has attracted some attention here, and I
                            have wondered if it has not something more behind it than that which the
                            press accords to it in its very brief explanation to the effect that he
                            had not been here for ten years and that he came to return the visit of
                            Lloyd George to Rome last winter. I saw those gentlemen yesterday
                            afternoon, but only for five minutes, as when I called Sonnino was on
                            the point of going to keep an engagement with Lloyd George, after which
                            Lloyd George had a War Committee meeting. I did not get a great deal of
                            information in reply to my inquiry as to what they had accomplished or
                            discussed at the Paris Conference, but I drew from de Martino an
                            expression of great interest in what was meant by the President’s
                            statement that he was studying the different plans for re-organization,
                            et cetera. He asked me what the President meant by this and what the
                            plans were. It was easy for me to say that I did not know enough to
                            enlighten him on this point, but that I did know enough to feel that the
                            President had already laid down the principles on which he felt the
                            re-organization should be made, and that it seemed to me that if Italy
                            desired to obtain the benefit of the help of the United States, it would
                            be well for her to endeavor to align herself with the United States so
                            that her aims might be in accord with those which the President had
                            already enunciated. He said he was going to say that to Sonnino, who had
                            already left.</p>
                        <p>I see from the extracts in the morning press from the Italian papers that
                            the Nationalist press in Italy is attacking Sonnino for what it terms
                            his surrender of Italian claims at the Paris Conference. The Moderate
                            press is excusing what he did there as a necessary concession to
                            England, but it is apparent that the newspapers in Italy as elsewhere
                            know very little of what was really done at the Paris Conference beyond
                            what was made public in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Your speech to the Press Association representatives in New York is the
                            subject of much comment and praise in the press here this morning; that
                            part of it in which you speak of the necessity of overcoming German
                            might by armed force and rescuing the world from the perils of German
                            military subjugation is especially commented on in warm terms of
                            approval. For myself I want to say that I agree with you absolutely,
                            remembering as I do how little effect starvation had on the South, which
                            subsequently collapsed from want of material of war—not from want of
                            food, which it had long undergone. I feel sure that your proposition is
                            absolutely sound—that Germany can only be beaten on the field of battle.
                            I think that it is universally recognized here that it was the coming in
                            of America that saved the situation. From policy or from pride <pb
                                n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0084"/>they may refuse to admit it
                            publicly, but I do not believe that any well-informed man denies the
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing are merely my impressions but I think that in the main they
                            give a reflection of the situation as it exists here to-day. Lloyd
                            George said in a talk last night to press representatives that he could
                            assure them that he had never known the spirit in France more resolute
                            and determined than it is at present. Based on the assumption of the
                            correctness of this statement, I would say that our entry into the war
                            is the thing which has brought about this change.</p>

                            response to the telegraphic instructions of Acting Secretary Polk under
                            date of July 19<note n="30" xml:id="d29fn2">Not printed.</note> to
                            “study and make a report for the information of the Department of the
                            present situation in France”.</p>
                        <p>A preliminary word as to the extent and manner of the study is pertinent.
                            From the first day of our arrival in Paris—throughout my stay I was,
                            fortunately, accompanied by Mr. Max Lowenthal, whose critical faculties
                            and imaginative industry were a most important help—I followed events
                            and pursued inquiry with the present study in view, so that the whole of
                            my stay in Paris, including the ten days preceding the receipt of the
                            Department’s wire, was in fact devoted to the study requested. This
                            anticipation enabled me to leave Paris in less than a week’s time after
                            the receipt of the Department’s instructions. Altogether we were in
                            France from July 12 to July 29. This entire period was passed in Paris,
                            except one day at the cantonments of the United States troops at
                            Gondrecourt and Demange-aux-Eaux, and the nearby hospital base at
                            Bazeilles, and one day at Bordeaux, whence we sailed on July 30.</p>
                        <p>Throughout I kept in mind the dangers against generalizing about any
                            people, particularly in war time, and particularly the French. I was
                            also mindful that Paris, however controlling in French life, is not
                            wholly France; that the feelings of those at the front and those at home
                            are not wholly the same; that the people may think differently from the
                            politicians.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, as to all phases I sought a quantitative judgment, and sought
                            to test individual feelings, doubts and opinions by evidence <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0085"/>weighty both in extent and
                            authoritativeness, and by rigorous questioning, to shake down opinions
                            to their residual foundation of facts. In this attitude we touched a
                            wide variety of French life through typical representatives. We talked
                            with French army officers of long service at the front as well as on the
                            staff, army surgeons, French officials, English and American diplomatic
                            officials resident in France during different periods of the war,
                            English and American army officers, French and American journalists of
                            different shades of opinion, members of the Chamber of Deputies,
                            bankers, lawyers, business men, and “just people”. I purposely
                            abstained, because the circumstances made it wise, from interviews with
                            cabinet members.</p>
                        <p rend="center">1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sources of unrest in French
                                morale</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That France is tired is surely by this time a platitude. One hears it
                            everywhere, from everybody. In addition to this pervasive feeling of
                            general tiredness there are a few basic facts which have profoundly
                            affected French morale, and are still potent. The outstanding single
                            fact is the enormous loss of lives. Whatever may be the authoritative
                            figures (probably known in the War Department at Washington), the
                            conservative estimates generally accepted in France place the loss in
                            dead and permanently disabled at over 2,000,000. Much more important
                            than the gross total is the widespread conviction among the French that
                            France cannot afford to lose many more. This feeling has been much
                            reinforced since the spring offensive. It is the universal testimony
                            that a veritably tragic shudder went through France when the whole
                            nation came to believe, largely as a result of the letters written home
                            from the front, that 100,000 men were sacrificed through an offensive
                            futile in result and generally regarded as unwise in conception. This
                            heavy blow came on top of an abnormally severe winter, bringing widely
                            felt hardships, especially through want of coal. Other economic
                            conditions, the rising high cost of living, and a growing popular belief
                            that wealth is largely immune from the costs of the war, also fed the
                            flame of unrest.</p>
                        <p>These are the main factors. There are minor elements which serve as items
                            of aggravation, such as the infrequency of furloughs for the men at the
                            front (recently corrected by General Petain), and the resentment aroused
                            in soldiers on leave by the sufferings of their families. All these
                            enervating factors gained collective strength from the disheartening
                            losses of the spring offensive, and together they undoubtedly
                            intensified the French feeling of unrest into a state of deep
                            depression.</p>
                        <p>This widespread feeling of war weariness and of decreasing hope has
                            become manifest in several noticeable directions. In a subtle yet
                            persistent way it has been availed of by peace propagandists to such <pb
                                n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0086"/>a degree that the growing number
                            of pacifist publications became the subject of interpellations in a
                            secret session of the Senate. The most sinister effect, and the one most
                            uncertain as to its future importance, has been the recrudescence of
                            Caillaux. For some time he had been working under cover. Latterly he has
                            come into the open, the financial policies of the government having
                            given Caillaux’s conceded financial ability the opportunity for an
                            effective reappearance. Making the most conservative discounts, allowing
                            for all the personal and political feeling against him, it cannot be
                            gainsaid that Caillaux is attaining a growing power in French political
                            life. His interests are associated with the presence of M. Malvy in the
                            Ribot cabinet. His importance is attested by the fact that in secret
                            session the government recently confessed itself dependent upon the
                            Caillaux group as represented by M. Malvy, for its supporting bloc. It
                            does not seem at all likely that Caillaux will himself come into power
                            for the present, or that, in office, he would open peace negotiations
                            immediately. But he is distinctly associated with early peace aims. In
                            private conversation he asserts that reasonable terms of peace could now
                            be made. More than that, Caillaux is playing on a vague, though probably
                            growing, suspicion, of England’s advantage as against France, from
                            continuance of the war. Caillaux frankly avows hostility to England.</p>

                        <p>The arrival of American troops and the belief that the United States will
                            largely take over France’s burden have oxyg[en]ized France and greatly
                            checked the peace tendencies of the spring. America’s participation is
                            the note of hope in the press, men at the front speak about it with
                            eager persistence, it served as the most effective answer by Ribot to
                            the attack, in secret session, against the government’s conduct of the
                            war. For the present the expectation that America will soon be at the
                            front is the fact that envelops one in France. Their hopes in us are
                            surely touching; their hopes have no less the seeds of danger. For the
                            expectations aroused are too exuberant and dangerously vague. If
                            American troops in great numbers will not be in France by the end of the
                            year, if the winter should again be a hard one, if the Russian situation
                            should become worse instead of better, the diverse elements of
                            impatience may well give Caillaux and his friends their opportunity.</p>

                        <p>There is then at present, thanks supremely to the American intervention,
                            a decided strengthening of spirit. But what is the native <pb n="41"
                                xml:id="pg_41" facs="0087"/>foundation of the endurance of the
                            French fighting spirit? Apart from disciplined obedience, what inner
                            cause holds them in the fight? The presence of Germans on French soil is
                            surely the controlling answer. That is enough to assure France’s
                            persistence under normal conditions. But there is a growing feeling,
                            which unusual hardship, as time passes, may raise to a dangerous degree,
                            that in any event French soil will be restored to France. German
                            occupation, then, furnishes no unequivocal affirmative aim of the war.
                            There is Alsace-Lorraine; but one is astounded to find among responsible
                            French opinion the feeling that Alsace-Lorraine may not be worth
                            fighting for much longer. Particularly to southern and western Frenchmen
                            do Alsace and Lorraine seem rather remote. These are feelings not now in
                            the ascendant, but they are feelings entertained with sufficient depth
                            and to a sufficient extent to be kept in mind as important in any
                            evaluation of the present and future forces of wartime France.</p>
                        <p>There is hardly a trace in France of the larger aim which brought the
                            United States into the war, or at least animates our prosecution of it,
                            namely, to have issue from the war not only the failure of German
                            aggression, but the frustration, through an international partnership, a
                            league of nations, of any future aggression. The program is not
                            discussed in the Chamber of Deputies, it is not made the subject of
                            speeches by the government, the press is silent about it. The important
                            exception is M. Leon Bourgeois. Otherwise the scheme of a league to
                            enforce peace is regarded as too “utopian”—the impatient adjective one
                            hears from practically all to whom the subject is mentioned. They are,
                            they say, too busy with the war to indulge in “philosophizing”. It is
                            too vague, they contend; they do not understand it. M. Bourgeois is
                            trying to direct attention to it; he is urging upon his colleagues the
                            appointment of a committee for its study. However, the strong impression
                            left on one’s mind is that Bourgeois is, as yet, a voice crying in the
                            wilderness.</p>

                        <p>The evident danger to the realization of America’s war aims, because of
                            an inadequate comprehension of these aims in France, makes indispensable
                            a consideration no less of the larger aspects of the French state of
                            mind than of the people’s fighting morale. The diagnosis of existing
                            French opinion which discloses a grave impediment to the accomplishment
                            of that which is behind our material contributions also discloses that
                            this source of danger can be counteracted, and some of the means by
                            which this can be done. The basic necessity for such action, and the
                            directions it can effectively <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0088"
                            />take, are among the most impelling aspects of the French
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Very little impetus can be expected to come out of France itself for a
                            sympathetic and cooperating understanding by the French of the war
                            purposes of the United States. They have hardly, if at all, broken
                            through the surface crust of the popular mind. They have not been
                            accorded more than the beginning of a serious discussion, even in that
                            narrowly limited section which has given them any thought at all. The
                            portions of the President’s speeches dealing with a sound future world
                            organization, which in the United States is deemed the very condition of
                            our war participation, are either unknown in France, or deemed aspiring
                            rhetoric.</p>
                        <p>The need of community of purposes between the two republics is obvious.
                            The conclusion is no less inevitable that, in the present state of the
                            French mind, we must take thought how we can be best assured of French
                            understanding and belief in such purposes. We ourselves must build
                            towards an opinion in France for a league of nations, or we may later be
                            without supporting knowledge in our French allies for such a claim by
                            us. Fortunately the means seem ready to hand for making the purposes of
                            the United States, which are conceived to be the world’s purposes, a
                            reality in France. French conditions make clear that some such course
                            can be safely undertaken by the United States, with every solicitude for
                            French susceptibilities. For the outstanding facts in France to-day, so
                            far as the United States is concerned, are the great leverage this
                            country now has in France, and the commanding authority enjoyed by
                            President Wilson. The problem is how this leverage and this authority
                            may be exercised.</p>

                            The chief difference lies in a preliminary agreement to restore Belgian
                            independence in exchange for the restoration of Germany’s colonies, to
                            erect an independent state out of “<hi rend="underline">part</hi> of the
                            old Kingdom of Poland” (meaning, probably, Russian Poland), and a
                            general condoning of the wrongs committed, though in particular cases a
                            modification according to “justice and equity”. Everything else, even
                            the sovereignty of the Balkan States, is left to negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Belgian independence and the recreation of Poland were at the time of the
                            German proposal in December considered to be essential to any
                            restoration of peace, so that the only new basis suggested is the
                            waiving by all parties of the losses sustained by them respectively.
                            Except in East Prussia, Galicia and Bukowina (territories which have
                            been reconquered) the Central Powers have not suffered from invasion and
                            hostile occupation. They have little to forgive.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand neutral Belgium has been grievously outraged and her
                            people impoverished, brutally treated, even enslaved. Would it be just
                            to deny the Belgians the right to claim full reparation for all they
                            have lost through three years of German occupation? Serbia and
                            Montenegro have, from all we can learn, been treated with equal, if not
                            with greater harshness. Are they not entitled to be indemnified for all
                            that they have endured? Roumania also has suffered though in a less
                            degree.</p>
                        <p>Is the enormous damage done by the German invaders in northern France not
                            even to be paid in part, though much of the damage was the result of
                            wantonness? Is the lawless destruction of hundreds of merchant vessels
                            by German submarines to be condoned?</p>
                        <p>If I read the Pope’s appeal aright, all these questions are to be
                            answered in the affirmative. It is carrying the Christian doctrine of
                            forgiveness a long way, since the burden falls very heavily on one side
                            and very lightly on the other. The suggestion is lacking in justice and
                            reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>The effort of the German Government through its December note was to
                            induce the Allied Powers to meet the Central Alliance in <pb n="45"
                                xml:id="pg_45" facs="0091"/>conference to negotiate on the basis of
                            the <hi rend="italic">status quo ante bellum</hi>. And that is all that
                            the Pope’s appeal does, except that Russian Poland is to be given
                            independence. With slight changes of territory here and there amounting
                            to a rectification of boundaries, I do not see that there is to be any
                            material change from the political conditions which existed prior to the
                            war and which resulted in the war.</p>
                        <p>As to the methods of insuring a continuance of peace, which are suggested
                            for negotiation, their adoption depends largely upon the trustworthiness
                            of the signatories to the peace treaty. In view of the violation of
                            Belgian neutrality, the disregard of human rights, the promises broken
                            by the German Government, I do not see how it is possible to rely upon
                            the good faith of that Government as it is now constituted. It would be
                            folly to expect it to change its character or to abandon its cherished
                            ambitions. To make peace by accepting guarantees from the military
                            rulers of Germany would only be to postpone the struggle not to end
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I think it necessary to consider the motives which inspired the Pope’s
                            appeal or the influences which induced him to make it at this particular
                            time, when the military tide of the Central Powers is at the flood, when
                            the submarine warfare appears to be most menacing, when the power of the
                            United States is just beginning to be exerted, when Russia has not yet
                            gained her equilibrium, when a vigorous peace propaganda in this country
                            and other countries is being pressed and when the socialistic bodies are
                            being employed, as at Stockholm, to demand an end of the war. I would
                            only say that the Pope, probably unwittingly or out of compassion for
                            Austria-Hungary, has become in this matter the agent of Germany.</p>
                        <p>In a word then the Pope’s appeal appears to me to be but a renewal of the
                            German proposal to negotiate and a suggestion of a peace based on the
                                <hi rend="italic">status quo ante</hi>. The proposal to negotiate
                            has already been declined by the Allies. The suggested basis must of
                            course be rejected by all.</p>

                            propose, I have gone over the matter very carefully again and I am more
                            firmly convinced than ever that such a communication would be a grave
                            mistake.</p>
                        <p>The same argument which is urged in regard to loans might be advanced in
                            regard to the employment of the embargo, the co-operation of our naval
                            vessels about the British Islands, the presence of our military forces
                            in France, and similar active aid by this Government. It seems to me
                            that it is much wiser to avoid statements of this sort, which might be
                            misconstrued. On the other hand, I am not at all afraid that any of the
                            powers will attempt to construe our silence into acquiescence in the
                            national objectives of the various countries. But, even if it should be
                            considered out of abundant caution to make our position plain, I think
                            that it would be unwise to do so until there is some evidence that such
                            a claim may be made. There is no evidence of the sort now.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have had several
                            intimations that the men at the head of the great news-gathering
                            associations and also some of the leading editors of the country feel
                            that, while every other branch of enterprise has been called in in an
                            advisory capacity to aid the Government, their knowledge has not been
                            utilized and their advice has not been asked in regard to systematizing
                            and making more efficient the various channels of publicity.</p>
                        <p>It is the wish of many, I understand, to help in an advisory capacity and
                            to cooperate more fully with the Government. I think that they have a
                            sincere desire to aid in any way they can, and have an impression that
                            the failure to use them is because they are not fully trusted.</p>
                        <p>I feel that it might accomplish a very real good to select a few leading
                            and trustworthy newspapermen, who would be fairly representative of the
                            press and organize them into an Advisory Council on Publicity. This
                            council could consult and advise with Mr. Creel and through their
                            influence control and direct press comment and news.</p>
                        <p>If this seems to you a suggestion worthy of consideration, perhaps you
                            might submit it to Mr. Creel for his views.</p>

                            intimations of the feeling on the part of the men at the head of the
                            news-gathering associations and of some of the leading editors of the
                            country, to which you refer in your letter of September first. It is
                            based upon a complex of misunderstandings (many of which are now being
                            removed) and of jealousies which I can expound to you some time, but the
                            net result of my impressions is that it would be safest not to call them
                            into systematic conference. They are a difficult lot to live with. They
                            do not agree among themselves.</p>

                            pouch. We aim to send all newspaper comment on American subjects. Your
                            speech pleased the English greatly and gave us all the keenest
                            pleasure.</p>
                        <p>The newspaper notice of House’s quest of peace data—it caused a little
                            shudder here in spite of your explanation and his that it had no
                            reference to making peace now but only to collecting information for the
                            peace conference. Peace isn’t a popular word here especially since
                            London is now in the firing line. A two-hour-&amp;-20-minute battle has
                            just ended here—ended, at least, for the moment. All the batteries in
                            London kept up a continuous fire and we heard the low thud of bombs as
                            the bombardment went on, and several of them jarred my house. We’ve had
                            6 raids in 8 nights now, &amp; I imagine we shall have one every night
                            so long as the moonlight lasts—a week more. With the dead to bury in
                            London every day, “peace” in any newspaper doesn’t please Londoners. All
                            this work can, I hope, be done without publicity. A boy has just brought
                            in a <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0094"/>4½ lb. piece of shell that
                            fell on the sidewalk in front of my house and having broken the pavement
                            stone rolled into the area. Our houses, you see, have become our
                            trenches.</p>
                        <p>I’ve written to House, of course, putting myself at his service in his
                            task. I can without publicity get any information in this Kingdom, and I
                            hold myself at your service in this as in all other matters.</p>
                        <p>This Government freely gives us all information that we seek. This is my
                            own experience; and I ask every man who comes here properly
                            authenticated, if he is getting what he comes for. They all say “Yes.”
                            The appreciation and applause of our vast preparation and of the
                            enormous service that we have already rendered are spoken on all sides
                            and in every quarter.</p>

                        <p>Senator Kellogg (Minn.) called at the Department on yesterday and left a

                            and said the following:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“A careful search of the records has been made and we find that we
                                had no information such as is stated by Senator La Follette in his
                                    speech.<note n="41" xml:id="d38fn2">See letter from the Chairman

                                touch with former Secretary Bryan. I did not know where he was but
                                by good fortune he was in Washington and I got him on the telephone.
                                He said he knew nothing about any ammunition on board the vessel
                                until three or four days after the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi>
                                had been sunk. There is absolutely nothing to it. He got hold of La
                                Follette (this is confidential you understand) and told him he ought
                                to deny the statement at once. La Follette said he had been told by
                                a man who claimed that Bryan had told him this story and that he
                                ought to get in touch with this man before he did it. Of course that
                                is an insult to Bryan. I told Mr. Bryan I was going to inform the
                                persons who had been making the inquiry in regard to it and he said
                                ‘All right’. That is the whole story. You can deny it
                                flat-footedly.”</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The French Ambassador
                            called upon me this afternoon and said that his Government were greatly
                            disturbed <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0095"/>over the situation in
                            Russia and that it was proposed to hold an Inter-Allied Conference in
                            Paris as soon as possible to consider what means might be adopted to aid
                            Russia and prevent further disintegration. He said that the date
                            tentatively fixed for the meeting was October 16th and that his
                            Government were most anxious that the United States should be
                            represented at the Conference.</p>
                        <p>He said further that while he hesitated to speak there was a feeling in
                            Paris that Colonel House would be most acceptable as our representative
                            in order that all the phases of the situation could be fully discussed.
                            I asked him if I should present this suggestion to you and he was
                            doubtful about it as he feared you might not like such a suggestion. I
                            replied to him that I was sure you would understand the hesitation which
                            he felt in presenting it and would myself take the responsibility of
                            submitting it to you.</p>
                        <p>I further told him that personally I did not think it was possible for
                            Colonel House to go at this time but could not speak with any authority
                            on the subject until I had communicated with you. I also said that I did
                            not wish to commit myself in any way as to the United States being
                            represented at the Conference, as it would be very difficult to find a
                            man properly equipped for such a conference and that all I could do was
                            to lay the matter before you. He said that he hoped, in any event, we
                            could have someone present at the Conference even if that person did not
                            take part as a member.</p>
                        <p>Personally I think something may be gained by a Conference of this sort
                            as Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia will be represented in any
                            event. We might have an “observer” present but where to find one in
                            Europe at this time I am rather at a loss to say. The only man of real
                            acuteness who understands the Russian situation among our diplomatic
                            representatives seems to me to be Ira Nelson Morris, our Minister to
                            Sweden.</p>
                        <p>I think this matter should be immediately decided as the situation in
                            Russia is certainly critical and everything should be done that can be
                            done to give stability to the Government there and possibly such a
                            Conference as is suggested would be of material aid.</p>

                            1917, Honorable Robert M. La Follette made an address before the

                            investigation by the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections. I
                            enclose herewith a copy of the address. <ref target="#pg_6">Page 6</ref>
                            of this address<note n="42" xml:id="d40fn1">The reference is to the

                                (65th Cong., 1st sess.).</note> contains the following:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Now, fellow citizens, we are in the midst of a war. For my own part
                                I was not in favor of beginning the war. (Continued applause) I
                                didn’t mean to say we had not suffered grievances. We had, at the
                                hands of Germany, serious grievances; we had cause for complaining;
                                they had interfered with the right of American citizens to travel
                                upon the high seas on ships loaded with munitions for Great Britain.
                                (Applause and yells.) And, gentlemen, I would not be understood as
                                saying we didn’t have grievances; we did, and upon those grievances,
                                which I have regarded as insufficient, considering the amount
                                involved and the rights involved, which was the right to ship
                                munitions to Great Britain with American passengers on board to
                                secure a safe transit. (Laughter and applause) We had a right, a
                                technical right, to ship munitions, and the American citizens had a
                                technical right to ride on those vessels. I was not in favor of
                                riding on them (laughter) because it seemed to me when the
                                consequences resulting from any destruction of life that might occur
                                would be so awful, I say (a voice: ‘Yellow’)—any man who says that
                                in an audience where he can conceal himself is yellow himself.
                                (Cries: ‘Put him out’.) I say this, that the comparatively small
                                privilege of the right of an American citizen to ride on a
                                munition-loaded ship flying a foreign flag is too small to involve
                                this country in a loss of millions and hundreds of millions of
                                lives. (Applause.)</p>
                            <p>“Now, fellow citizens, I didn’t believe we should have gone into this
                                war for that poor privilege, the right of an American citizen to
                                travel upon a foreign vessel loaded with munitions of war, because a
                                foreign vessel loaded with munitions of war is technically foreign
                                territory (applause), and an American citizen takes his own life in
                                his own hands, just as much as he would if he were on the territory
                                of France and camped in the neighborhood of an arsenal. Mr.
                                President, it has sometimes occurred to me that the shippers of
                                munitions of war, who are making enormous profits out of the
                                business, should not have encouraged American citizens to ride on
                                those ships in order to give a sort of semblance of safety to the
                                passage of their profiteering cargo abroad. (Applause) But, Mr.
                                President, we went into the war by the adoption by Congress of a
                                declaration of war in constitutional form; therefore, we are in the
                                war legally. I was not in favor of going into the war illegally; I
                                resisted the right to arm merchantmen when I knew that that would
                                result in producing a condition that would bring about war without a
                                declaration by Congress, and the Constitution says that Congress,
                                and not the acts of the President, shall bring on a war with a
                                foreign Government. (Applause) But war is declared and lawfully
                                declared; it was not brought about by unlawfully and tyrannically
                                arming of merchant ships. I had a little bit to do with stopping
                                that on the 4th of March, and I put it to my everlasting credit that
                                I was able to do it. (Applause)”</p>

                                American rights? The right of some venturesome person to ride upon a
                                munition-laden vessel in violation of an American statute that no
                                vessel which carries explosives shall carry passengers. Four days
                                before the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> sailed President Wilson
                                was warned in person by Secretary of State Bryan that the <hi

                                on board, besides explosives, and that the passengers who proposed
                                to sail on that vessel were sailing in violation of a statute of
                                this country, that no passengers shall travel upon a railroad train
                                or sail upon a vessel which carries dangerous explosives. (Applause)
                                And Mr. Bryan appealed to President Wilson to stop passengers from
                                sailing upon the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi>. I am giving you
                                some history that maybe has not come to you heretofore—the
                                grievances that carried this country into the war, into a war the
                                results of which, as to the loss of life and burdens, financial
                                burdens, that shall be laid upon us cannot be calculated by any
                                mind. I say that the conditions that carried us into that war needed
                                to be weighed carefully, for I annunciate no new doctrine, but the
                                doctrine of Daniel Webster, who said when the Mexican War was on
                                that it was the right of the people of this country to determine for
                                themselves whether there has been a sufficient grievance of the
                                people to incur all of the burdens and risks that go with a war of
                                this kind.”</p>

                            M. La Follette before the Non-Partisan League Convention at Saint Paul,

                            and Elections. In your letter you quote certain extracts from this
                            address and request, on behalf of the Committee mentioned, to be

                            June 2, 1915, from the Treasury Department and photographic copies of

                        <p>As regards the second inquiry, viz.: “Did the passengers aboard this
                            vessel sail in violation of a statute of this country?”, I would suggest
                            that you request the Attorney-General to furnish you with the desired
                            information, as it pertains to the interpretation of a federal
                            statute.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the third inquiry, viz.: “Did Mr. Bryan or the Department of
                            State appeal to President Wilson to stop passengers from sailing upon
                            the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania?</hi>”, I am advised the [<hi

                        <p>As regards the fourth inquiry, viz.: “To what extent did the grievances
                            connected with the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> carry
                            this country into the war?”, I beg to say that the sinking of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> was only one—though in some respects
                            the most monstrous—of several cases in which merchant ships with
                            American citizens on board were sunk by German submarines without
                            warning and without any regard <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0099"
                            />for the safety of the persons on board, in violation of international
                            law and the dictates of humanity. This case was immediately taken up
                            with the German Government and formed the subject of considerable
                            diplomatic correspondence in which the position of this Government was
                            fully set forth and maintained. Copies of this correspondence have
                            already been delivered to you. It will be observed from the paper of
                            most recent date, namely, the note of the German Ambassador of September
                            1, 1915,<note n="44" xml:id="d41fn2">

                                    530</ref>.</note> that the German Government admitted the
                            contentions of this Government that ships like the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Lusitania</hi> should be warned, and that the safety of
                            non-combatants should be assured, which procedure was understood to
                            require visit and search. The German Government, in spite of its solemn
                            promises, repeatedly attacked passenger vessels until finally it
                            abandoned all pretense of fulfilling its engagements, and by its
                            declaration of January 31, 1917 (see the note from the German Ambassador
                            of that date),<note n="45" xml:id="d41fn3">

                            repudiated its promises and began a campaign of indiscriminate submarine
                            warfare.</p>
                        <p>The destruction of the <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> was but one of
                            the incidents in the lawless and inhuman policy of the German
                            Government, which emphasized the evil character of that Government and
                            made impossible any honorable adjustment of the controversy over its
                            illegal and unprecedented use of submarines, or any dependence upon the
                            undertaking of a Government which wilfully violated its word because it
                            interfered with its ruthless policy.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the fifth inquiry, viz.: “Kindly also give us the diplomatic

                            it would be well I think not to discuss the subject with the

                            to the conclusion that a simpler way than giving him a certified copy of
                            the letter addressed to the French Ambassador here would be for you to
                            give him a formal designation. I therefore enclose a letter which I
                            would suggest be given him. In view of the regard for formality which
                            prevails among European governments it might be well <pb n="57"
                                xml:id="pg_57" facs="0103"/>for me to countersign your letter and
                            place upon it the seal of the Department.</p>
                        <p>If this course meets with your approval will you please sign the letter
                            and return it to me for transmission to Colonel House—indicating whether
                            or not you approve of the countersigning.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I believe it is already
                            quite familiar to you that a considerable portion of the loans made by
                            this Government to the British Government and also to the French
                            Government, acting more or less indirectly through the British
                            Government, have been used for the purpose of buying all French and
                            English exchange offered on the New York market. In so far as the amount
                            thus purchased <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0104"/>represents final
                            balances of trade between France and England on the one hand and neutral
                            countries on the other, the purchase of these bills is in fact a payment
                            of the debts of English and French nationals or their Governments for
                            the balances thus incurred. Until a recent date, it was possible for the
                            sellers of these goods throughout the world to receive ultimate payment,
                            if they so desired, by the shipment of gold from the United States. This
                            movement, as has been indicated to you in the past, had attained very
                            considerable proportions when the tentative embargo upon gold shipments
                            was established by our Government. Since that date, the sales of these
                            bills have resulted rather in the establishing of credits in New York
                            banks in favor of the selling countries or the banks in various neutral
                            countries representing these original sellers, these credits remaining
                            as a part of the deposits of our great banks.</p>
                        <p>From this point of view perhaps there should be no complaint on our part,
                            save that two questions of great import are presented in connection with
                            the matter, namely, first, that the establishment of these credits
                            through the means above indicated means at all times a heavy and almost
                            unbearable pressure upon the Treasury of the United States to furnish to
                            the French and British Governments the moneys to make the purchases of
                            bills of exchange in New York; and, second, that after a certain period
                            it may appear that the sellers of the goods, say from the Argentine
                            Republic, or from Brazil, or Spain, will be unwilling or unable to
                            receive their payment solely in New York bank credits. In this latter
                            case, it is apparent that our associates in the war would be deprived,
                            unless other means are taken, of obtaining goods which in the main we
                            know are considered by them as essential for the prosecution of the war.
                            It is true that some further economies in respect to their purchases in
                            neutral markets may be established; but, without going too narrowly into
                            the question, we are assuming now that they have already exercised an
                            extreme prudence in limiting their importations to articles considered
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>In order to alleviate the situation without continuing the supply of
                            funds for the purchase of bills of exchange in New York, with the
                            attendant danger indicated above, the following means of relieving the
                            situation have been discussed, namely:</p>
                        <p>1. That there should be an absolute forbidding of the dealing in bills
                            traceable to neutral countries for British and French commerce in our
                            market, thus at once diminishing the demand for moneys by those
                            Governments intended for the purchase of these bills. This, of course,
                            is an extreme and from many points of view an undesirable remedy, and is
                            mentioned merely as one of the possible remedies. It would be attended
                            with such great hardships upon our associates in the war that we
                            scarcely like to contemplate it.</p>
                        <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>2. That there should be a renewed study by our associates in the war of
                            the possibility of purchasing in this country the goods which they are
                            now obtaining in neutral countries, which commerce creates the situation
                            here described. It may be assumed that this particular remedy is now
                            being more or less applied by the British and French Governments, but it
                            seems difficult if not impossible that the whole situation should be
                            thus met, since in the case of certain minerals from Spain, coffee from
                            Brazil, and needed grain supplies from the Argentine, our markets cannot
                            offer substitutes.</p>
                        <p>3. It has been considered that possibly the neutrals selling the goods in
                            question might be content with increasing their London bank credits.
                            This process, however, has been going on for so long a time in London
                            and Paris, since the beginning of the war, that it is believed by the
                            English and French advisers that it can scarcely be carried further.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, it has seemed possible that by arrangement with these neutral
                            countries their whole fiscal systems may be modified to meet the
                            world-wide emergency in this way, namely, that as against securities or
                            other satisfactory guarantees owned by the English or French Governments
                            or their nationals, the neutral countries in question should issue
                            currency in their own countries permitting payment to their producers
                            for the articles in question. This is by far the most obvious and
                            sensible arrangement which could be made. Obviously, it is not easy to
                            accomplish at once. Doubtless in some cases legislation of special
                            character would be required in order that paper money should be issued
                            against securities in ways not now familiar in the countries in
                            question. It does not follow that an actual legislative change of
                            monetary systems will be required in every country in question, but it
                            is contemplated that in some countries such changes may be required, and
                            hence, since we cannot assume that these changes could be immediately
                            brought about, it is desirable that the question should receive large
                            and general consideration at as early a date as possible.</p>
                        <p>The importance of the matter is such that I venture to suggest that you
                            should communicate to the neutral governments which I shall name below a
                            statement that it is believed to be of common interest to them and to
                            this Government that their present representatives in Washington should
                            be fully empowered to negotiate such financial arrangements as have been
                            above indicated, or that other representatives thus empowered should
                            immediately be sent to Washington.</p>
                        <p>For your information, I beg to state that I have talked this matter over
                            with the representatives of Great Britain and France, who approve of the
                            proposed procedure. They realize that what we are attempting to
                            accomplish is specially for their benefit.</p>
                        <p>The countries in question are, notably, Brazil, the Argentine Republic,
                            Chile, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Denmark and Switzerland. You will

                        <p>In regard to the violated pledges of the German Government, I enclose an
                            informal memorandum entitled: “Violations of German Pledges Regarding
                            Conduct of Submarine Warfare,”<note n="58" xml:id="d53fn7">Not printed;
                                consists chiefly of extracts from correspondence previously
                                printed.</note> which reviews roughly, in chronological order, the
                            German declarations of submarine warfare, the attack upon or sinking of
                            certain vessels thereunder, and the various pledges given by the German
                            Government from time to time up to April 6, 1917.</p>

                            matters directly connected with the prosecution of the war, and in my
                            judgment that is the policy which it should pursue. My request,
                            therefore, concerns only such matters as you think should be provided
                            for at once and cannot be postponed.</p>
                        <p>Cordially and sincerely yours,</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Replying to your
                            request of November 28, for a statement as to any legislation which
                            should be considered by Congress at this session, I enclose memoranda on
                            this subject which are self-explanatory.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these memoranda I might suggest that, in my opinion, it
                            would be wise if Congress would pass a resolution suspending during the
                            term of the war the so-called Seaman’s Act.<note n="58a" xml:id="d55fn1"
                                >38 Stat. 1164.</note> I understand that Secretary Redfield is
                            strongly in favor of this. Many protests from foreign countries,
                            particularly the Allied countries, have come to my knowledge complaining
                            that as a result of this Act it is impossible to hold seamen on merchant
                            vessels as they are free to desert whenever they please, following their
                            own inclinations whether voluntarily or induced by German intrigue.</p>
                        <p>In this connection may I also suggest that it would be of great value to
                            this Department if a law could be passed making it perjury for false
                            affidavits to be presented to this Department or any Department of the
                            Government by persons seeking action in support of their interests
                            abroad. I understand that there is a provision in the Civil Service law
                            which protects the Commission from misstatements. Such a law for the
                            Department of State would go far in preventing it from being imposed
                            upon by unscrupulous persons. Now, as heretofore, the Department has to
                            rely upon statements in affidavits presented <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                                facs="0111"/>to it as the basis for communications with foreign
                            governments. It is very important, particularly at the present time,
                            that there should be some law requiring persons to tell the truth and
                            nothing but the truth in the sworn statements which they present to the
                            Department in support of their claims.</p>

                            <p>The Draft Act of May 18, 19l7,<note n="58b" xml:id="d55fn2">40 Stat.
                                    76.</note> provides for the conscription of aliens (except enemy
                                aliens) who have taken out their first papers. Neutral countries
                                have protested against such conscription of their subjects, those
                                having treaties of exemption basing their protests on treaty
                                provisions, and those having no treaties basing their protests on
                                international law and custom. As you know, the War Department, with
                                your approval, has acceded to their views, and accordingly this
                                Department has advised the neutral countries that while there is no
                                way under the Draft Act to exempt their subjects, the President, in
                                his capacity as Commander-in-chief, would discharge them immediately
                                after they had been incorporated in the army, upon satisfactory
                                proof of their nationality. To the Spanish Ambassador, who has been
                                particularly insistent upon the exemption of his fellow-countrymen,
                                and also of the subjects of Turkey, whose interests are in his
                                charge, the Department has said that it would suggest the amendment
                                of the present Draft Act so as to avoid the present circuitous
                                procedure.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the action of the Government in discharging
                                neutral declarants from the army is virtually a refusal to execute
                                the act of Congress in this respect, it would seem to me that the
                                situation should be cleared up by an amendment to the Draft Act
                                excluding from its operation declarants of neutral nationality.</p>
                            <p>The Governments who are co-operating with us in the war have not
                                (except Cuba) protested against the incorporation of their
                                declarants in the American Army.</p>

                            <p>A large number of Norwegian ships are being built in American
                                shipyards, and the Shipping Board is desirous of taking over these
                                ships for the purpose of speeding up their construction and for the

                                and of the protest of the Norwegian Government thereunder. A plan of
                                having the title to these ships vested in an American corporation
                                and having them chartered to the Shipping Board during the war is
                                being worked out so as to avoid a possible violation of the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>The War Trade Board is desirous of controlling the movements of
                                Swedish and Norwegian ships coming to American ports by the refusal
                                of licenses until the owners or masters sign the “bunker agreement”
                                by which in general they undertake not to assist the enemy, but to
                                transport cargoes for the Allies. In some cases the ships come here
                                with full bunkers for the purpose of unloading part of their
                                cargoes, without taking on any supplies or bunkers. To refuse a
                                license to at least this class of ships, and so to detain them until
                                they sign the bunker agreement, would seem to be a violation of the
                                treaty, and would leave a large number of ships free from the
                                control desired by the War Trade Board. Relying on this treaty, the
                                Swedish Government has protested against such action on the part of

                                country by Swedish and Norwegian owners, and such seizures might be
                                regarded by Sweden and Norway as violating this treaty, although
                                they have not yet, so far as I am advised, raised the treaty article
                                in this connection.</p>
                            <p>The so-called Seamen’s Act has abrogated articles in these treaties
                                relating to the apprehension of deserting seamen, and has modified
                                other articles relating to the right of consular officers to decide
                                differences between the captains and crews of merchant vessels.
                                Under this Act notice was served on Norway that this Government
                                desired to suspend the articles affected but retain the remaining
                                articles of the treaty.<note n="58e" xml:id="d55fn5">See <ref

                            <p>In view of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that it might be well
                                to terminate these treaties by one year’s notice, in accordance with
                                their terms, or preferably, to abrogate the treaties by a resolution
                                of the Senate. I enclose the subjects of the articles of these two
                                treaties, which show the scope of the matters covered by them.<note

                                90 to 135 years ago are largely unsuited to present conditions.</p>

                        <p>901. The Supreme War Council sat at Versailles this morning at 10:30.
                            General Bliss and I represented the United States. Clemenceau and Foch,
                            France, Milner and Lloyd George, Robertson and Wilson, Great Britain,
                            Orlando and Cadorna, Italy, were present. The French Prime Minister
                            presided. The following questions submitted for examination: One, Italy,
                            two, Saloniki, three, Roumania.</p>
                        <p>One, Italy. The French Prime Minister said it was necessary to know
                            whether offensive or defensive measures were to be considered and that
                            choice of operation should not be left to enemy. Orlando thought that
                            aid should be sent to Italy immediately without waiting for a report,
                            alleging that if divisions sent were in excess of requirements they
                            could always be sent back. Lloyd George said that railway facilities to
                            Italy were so limited that with six French divisions using the Mont
                            Cenis and six British divisions using the Ventimiglia route no
                            transportation facilities would be left for supplying Saloniki. He
                            suggested that a railway expert be appointed to report on the
                            transportation situation as a whole including not only Italian
                            transportation question, but also transportation across the Atlantic and
                            railway transportation on the various theatres of the war. He said that
                            Geddes would be a good man to draw up this report if he could be spared
                            and report could be made in about 2 months. Orlando said that in
                            addition to the railways between France and Italy it was possible always
                            to send men by [ship?] from Marseilles to Genoa, a trip which would
                            involve only one night. At Genoa he said that the Italians had six large
                            steamers which could be utilized for this work.</p>
                        <p>Two. The French Prime Minister proposed that the disposition of the
                            Belgian [<hi rend="italic">Greek</hi>?] army consisting of six divisions
                            which had done nothing up to the present time but issue communiqués be
                            considered. It was agreed that a dossier on this subject be
                            distributed.</p>
                        <p>Three. The question Saloniki was taken up and the chairman said that
                            unfortunately very little was known about the situation and what was
                            known was unfavorable. He stated that the British had 170,000 troops at
                            Saloniki and only 40,000 bayonets. Wilson objected to this latter figure
                            but could not give reliable estimate thereof. The French Prime Minister
                            said he could give absolutely no details as to French army. Sarrail had
                            been directed to report but the report was not satisfactory. He stated
                            that the French Government intended to reorganize the French army at
                            Saloniki and that, in view of the fact <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69"
                                facs="0115"/>that in addition to the French and British troops there
                            were also Italian, Greek and Russian forces there, he did not think that
                            the expedition should be abandoned. The French [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Greek</hi>?] Prime Minister in the meantime having [assured?] the
                            conference there were three Greek divisions actually on the front at
                            Saloniki and that Greece was prepared to put nine divisions more into
                            the field if the munitions promised by the Allies at the conference in
                            Paris of the present year as well as the provisions were forthcoming. He
                            said that the essential thing was that Greece should receive provisions
                            as his country was on starvation rations. Foch objected that the Greeks
                            had not lived up to their agreement to disband their old army and to
                            send the men back to the Peloponnesus. Venezelos admitted that this had
                            not been done because all of the rolling stock of the Greek railways had
                            been taken by the Allies for work at Saloniki and that the Greeks had
                            had most of their merchant marine taken by the Allies and if these ships
                            were restored to them they would transport their own provisions.</p>
                        <p>Lloyd George said he thought it vital to the Allies that authority of
                            Venezelos be supported and that provisions be sent to Greece. He said
                            that he had not realized how badly and how unintelligently the Allies
                            had treated Greece. Klotz, the French Minister of Finance, appeared
                            before council and stated that after conferring with Venezelos [?] and
                            Crosby he had ascertained that sum of 50 million francs was immediately
                            necessary for the expenses of November and December of the Greek army.
                            This sum has been placed at the disposal of the Greek Government
                            yesterday although Crosby had made certain reservations as far as the
                            United States was concerned. The French Prime Minister asked House
                            whether the United States were prepared to participate with France and
                            England in lending money to Greece. House replied that he thought they
                            would be. Klotz said that Greek army budget for the year 1918 amounted
                            to 900 million francs divided as follows: 350 million francs pay for
                            1918. Venezelos stated that Greece herself could provide internally 150
                            million francs of the amount, leaving balance of 750 million francs to
                            be provided by the Allies. Bliss and House approving. Crosby states that
                            he will recommend to McAdoo that the United States provide one-third of
                            this amount, England and France making up balance provided tentative
                            estimate of 600 million francs additional for the Greek army munition
                            program for 1918 is taken care of in similar or other manner. Crosby
                            will explain in a separate cable to the Treasury details of proposed
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Four. Details of the Roumanian situation left to military authorities
                            which have already discussed situation. Thereupon conference adjourned
                            at 1:30 p. m.</p>

                            results of Paris Conference but everything depends now putting decisions

                        <p>He was impressed by House, says latter appeared understand his
                            Government’s practical suggestions. He is disappointed House could not
                            come to Italy, as I am. He says that Italy’s present needs of grain and
                            coal so serious that question of supplying sufficient tonnage
                            immediately to furnish her these is most urgent.</p>
                        <p>He expressed his pleasure at the President’s recommending declaration of
                            state of war with Austria-Hungary. Believes that it will have important
                            effect. Text of message appeared in press few hours later. Comments so
                            far very favorable.</p>
                        <p>I hear from reliable source that feeling in some quarters is that England
                            has not yet pooled all interests in common cause, and will not do so,
                            fearing that it may lead to appointment of generalissimo who would be
                            French General and also will not consider greater urgency of needs in
                            Italy as demanding more than prorata relief. These two ideas may have to
                            be reckoned with for a strong propaganda has gone on telling people that
                            England alone is keeping Italy and France at war.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: There is being brought
                            considerable pressure for the issuance of a declaration in regard to
                            this Government’s attitude as to the disposition to be made of
                            Palestine. This emanates naturally from the Zionist element of the
                            Jews.</p>
                        <p>My judgment is that we should go very slowly in announcing a policy for
                            three reasons. First, we are not at war with Turkey and therefore should
                            avoid any appearance of favoring taking territory from that Empire by
                            force. Second, the Jews are by no means a unit in the desire to
                            reestablish their race as an independent people; to favor one or the
                            other faction would seem to be unwise. Third, many Christian sects and
                            individuals would undoubtedly resent turning the Holy Land over to the
                            absolute control of the race credited with the death of Christ.</p>
                        <p>For practical purposes I do not think that we need go further than the
                            first reason given since that is ample ground for declining to announce
                            a policy in regard to the final disposition of Palestine.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: For a long time before the official
                            recognition of the Polish National Committee at Paris, the members of
                            that organization have been carrying out the work of propaganda among
                            the masses of Polish population for the resistance to Germany’s
                            political plans. Their endeavors, involving considerable expenditure of
                            energy and money, have been successful. Outside of two members, who
                            cheerfully offered for that purpose all they had possessed, the expenses
                            of the propaganda were covered partly by contributions from the Polish
                            organizations in the United States, partly by private donations from <pb
                                n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0118"/>that part of Russian Poland which
                            has not been invaded by the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The present position of the Polish National Committee at Paris, while
                            greatly enhanced, both politically and morally, through its recognition
                            as an official organization by the Entente Powers and the United States
                            Government, is nevertheless very precarious by reason of the existing
                            financial conditions. Though not adopting, for obvious political
                            reasons, temporarily at least, the name of a provisional government, the
                            Polish National Committee has assumed all the burden of responsibility
                            of such an institution and accepted many of its charges imposed upon it
                            by the very fact of its recognition as an official organization. The
                            already established agencies and offices in Paris, London, Rome,
                            Lausanne and Petrograd with their numerous staffs require the more funds
                            as the members and agents of the Polish National Committee at Paris,
                            handicapped by comprehensible difficulties of correspondence, by letters
                            and wires, are obliged to travel constantly in order to communicate
                            personally. The resources of individuals are now totally exhausted. The
                            contributions from the Polish organizations are being absorbed by
                            charities, especially by the needs of Polish volunteers going to fight
                            in France. The recent social and political disturbances in Russia have
                            completely wiped out all that remained of Polish fortunes there. The
                            Polish National Committee at Paris has practically no financial means
                            whatever.</p>
                        <p>In view of this distressing situation, the Polish National Committee at
                            Paris, much to its regret, finds itself compelled to appeal to the
                            United States for aid, and most respectfully begs your Excellency to
                            decide whether the President or the Government of the United States
                            would be inclined to grant, in the form of a loan, to the future State
                            of Poland, the financial help as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Sixty thousand dollars as a monthly subvention for the maintenance of
                            agencies and offices already existing in Paris, London, Rome, Lausanne,
                            and Petrograd as well as of those which are to be established in neutral
                            countries, for the duration of the war.</p>
                        <p>2. One million dollars for the immediate relief of Polish refugees in
                            Russia whose situation, under the present regime, is most critical and
                            the number exceeds sixteen hundred thousand.</p>
                        <p>3. A subsidy of five hundred thousand dollars for the purpose of bringing
                            over from Russia, five hundred experienced Polish officers of all ranks,
                            already promised by the Russian General Staff, and whose presence among
                            the Polish soldiers would greatly increase the value of that fighting
                            material.</p>
                        <p>The members of the Polish National Committee at Paris, enjoying
                            confidence and respect of an immense majority of our people, there is no
                            doubt that the future State of Poland would gladly redeem this loan
                            which, however important, is only a trifling matter as compared <pb
                                n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0119"/>to the unbounded indebtedness of
                            Poland towards the President, the Government, and the people of the

                            various heads at the beginning instead of summarized at the end and are
                            as follows:</p>
                        <p>1st: The feeling of war-weariness is plainly evident and the desire for
                            peace is universal throughout Austria and Hungary, both on the part of
                            the Government, including the Emperor (whom Count Apponyi described as
                            “the greatest pacifist” he knows), and on the part of the people; and
                            the necessity for an early peace on account of present conditions is
                            most pressing.</p>
                        <p>2nd: Notwithstanding the pressure of necessity and the sacrifices endured
                            by the people, no separate peace with the Entente is considered
                            possible. Suggestions for a separate peace have been made by unreliable
                            demagogues, but the people, though blaming Germany for desiring
                            conquest, annexations, and other obstacles to peace, repudiate the
                            suggestions. Count Apponyi said it would be “infamy more than could be
                            described” for them to make a separate peace, that any amount of
                            suffering will be endured before that could happen. This was confirmed
                            after his conference with the Emperor Carl and Count Czernin. This was
                            supported by Mr. Drucker of the Vienna Bank Verein, speaking for
                            financial and industrial circles, and by the leading social democrat of
                            the Austrian Parliament, Dr. Julius Offner, speaking for the common
                            people.</p>
                        <p>3rd: That Austria and Hungary will yield to their necessities and consent
                            to any terms, outside of disgrace, to obtain peace. In a conference to
                            which Germany shall be a party, they will oppose the demands of the
                            Pan-Germanists and support the aims of the Entente if in accordance with
                            the “Wilson policy”. (I left Austria before the speech of Lloyd George
                            of January 5th, which moderated his aims in regard to Germany as
                            previously understood; and before that date Count Apponyi said Lloyd
                            George’s policy to continue fighting <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74"
                                facs="0120"/>would mean “only butchery of the fighting forces
                            without victory for either side”.</p>
                        <p>4th: That 95 per cent, of the people of Austria-Hungary and a very large
                            majority of the German people are antagonistic to the German Junker
                            Party or Pan-Germanists. It was affirmed by several of those I
                            interviewed that out of a total population of 125,000,000 in the Central
                            Powers, more than 100,000,000 are opposed to the military party.</p>
                        <p>5th: That in Austria a far more correct understanding of the will of the
                            German people exists than that known to the outside world. That the
                            German press is largely owned by the militarists, many papers having
                            been recently purchased by the Krupp funds. What papers are not owned by
                            them are for the most part censored in their interest. The will of the
                            German people is known to Count Czernin, who is in constant
                            communication with Count von Hertling and von Kuehlmann.</p>
                        <p>6th: It is known in Austria that the majority of the German people favor
                            peace on the basis of no annexations, reduction of armaments,
                            arbitration of disputes, and an established international organization
                            to prevent future wars. The Chancellor, who is now speaking for the
                            people of Germany, has declared himself in perfect sympathy with the
                            announcement of the above aims stated by Count Czernin in Budapest and
                            sanctioned by the Hungarian Parliament. No such definite declaration of
                            German aims has been made public to the world at large before. Von
                            Kuehlmann, now acting in accordance with the will of the German majority
                            in the Reichstag, has recently consistently held to the “no annexations
                            policy” and has stated, according to Count Apponyi, that “There is
                            nothing now in the way of peace except on the part of the Entente
                            nations,” and that “Alsace-Lorraine is the only question that remains to
                            be settled to obtain peace.” As to the authority of the Chancellor to
                            speak for the people of Germany, Count Apponyi says, “No Chancellor can
                            now exist who has not the good will of the Reichstag.” He says this has
                            been proved by the removal of Michaelis and the appointment of von
                            Hertling and is confirmed by information from German sources which I
                            obtained and cabled to you from Holland at the time von Hertling was
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p>7th: What seems the most important result of all the information is the
                            invitation sent through me to the Entente for a “conversation”, as it
                            was called, in the interests of democratization. Not a peace conference,
                            but a meeting between a few representatives (not more than three or four
                            for the entire Entente and three or four for the Central Powers and
                            their allies). The kind of democratization that will be required and the
                            kind that could be conceded would be discussed and <pb n="75"
                                xml:id="pg_75" facs="0121"/>probably an agreement on that important
                            condition to a settlement would be reached. The will of the majority of
                            the people of Germany would become known and the full support of Austria
                            and Hungary would be for fair enfranchisements. Many misunderstandings
                            that exist today, according to Count Apponyi, would be removed. The
                            “conversation” so held would be of an unbinding nature and could do no
                            harm. Democratization could be brought about in friendly conference but
                            not enforced on the point of an enemy’s sword. While all of the
                            belligerents might be entitled to a knowledge of the meeting, it should
                            be kept from the press until actually an accomplished fact. On the first
                            interview, Count Apponyi said that the Central Powers could not again
                            call a conference as they were so repulsed in regard to the call of
                            December 1916, but at the second interview, after his conference with
                            Emperor Carl and Count Czernin and just after Czernin’s conference at
                            the Court of Berlin, the above proposal was made and I agreed to carry
                            it to the President of the United States for him to decide whether it
                            should be submitted to the Governments of the Entente or not. Count
                            Apponyi believes that a greater burden of responsibility rests upon
                            President Wilson than on any one man since the days of Moses and that a
                            greater aggregate of confidence is placed in his wisdom than was ever
                            bestowed on any one man since the beginning of the world. If it should
                            be decided to take any further steps in regard to this meeting, the
                            proposal as far as Austria is concerned is only known to Czernin,
                            Apponyi and the Emperor Carl, and I have means of communicating with
                            them on the subject through their Legations either in Holland or
                            Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>8th: From observations as to conditions:—The first impression of abnormal
                            conditions is received in traveling after crossing the frontier. In
                            Austria and in Hungary the accommodations are far from adequate for the
                            number of people traveling; fares have been doubled and in some
                            instances trebled, but it does not seem to restrict sufficiently the
                            number of passengers. Every train is crowded and many were compelled to
                            stand in the corridors, beside over-crowding the seats in all the trains
                            that I used. Sleeping cars and dining cars are withdrawn even from long
                            distance trains and for lack of food many station restaurants have been
                            discontinued and others in Austria only serve tea or coffee without a
                            particle of sugar or milk, with not even bread or a biscuit to eat.
                            Passengers on the trains carried a dark-colored bread, from which they
                            cut a chunk with a pocket knife and ate it with apparent satisfaction.
                            Probably the number of travelers seems larger than normal on account of
                            fewer trains, but it is enough to indicate that people have money to
                            spend, which fact is confirmed by the crowded hotels that are charging
                            high prices but are constantly full. At Vienna, I was refused at five
                            hotels that <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0122"/>showed me waiting
                            lists and finally got a room reserved for a party that did not arrive at
                            a cost of 34 Kronen per day. At Budapest, after being refused at four
                            hotels, I was taken in by a New Yorker who keeps the Astoria Hotel,
                            after he had refused fifty people that night. It was two hours before he
                            had a closet fixed up where I could spend the night. In Budapest the
                            hotels were very gay; music and dancing go on in most of them during the
                            evening. As in other countries, labor is well employed and well paid in
                            Austria and Hungary. Food seemed scarcer in Austria than in Hungary. I
                            did not see any butter, milk or sugar in Vienna, but had a limited
                            supply in Budapest. One does not see poverty, if any exists. Throngs of
                            people are on the streets and in the shops. The street cars running
                            trailers of three and four are packed so that I did not get further than
                            the platforms on any occasion when I used them. It was the time for
                            Christmas shopping and Christmas trees in abundance were offered on the
                            streets and the usual advertising of gifts displayed. There were lines
                            of people at different places where food is dispensed, but the lines
                            were no longer than I had seen in London. Walking close to these lines,
                            I saw no distress and though it was a very cold day with snow on the
                            ground, the people seemed good-natured and patient. The bread allowance
                            while I was there was 219 grammes per day per person, equal to about six
                            average sized rolls.</p>
                        <p>9th: Regarding Count Karolyi:—Without disclosing any information as to
                            what I had learned in regard to Count Karolyi having made suggestions to
                            this Government, I tried to learn what I could about him. Count Apponyi
                            volunteered information at the first part of our interview, apparently
                            supposing I had talked with Karolyi, but I had not. He spoke of not
                            agreeing with him, that he had ideas he could not carry out and was
                            chimerical. Apponyi said at times he (Karolyi) had quarrelled with the
                            Ministers of his Government, but thought he would prove himself a
                            patriot in an emergency. . . .</p>
                        <p>10th: Regarding possibilities of revolution in Austria-Hungary:—It was
                            said in Germany before the late declaration of war by the United States
                            against Austria-Hungary, that people in Germany thought such a
                            declaration might precipitate a revolution in Austria. I talked with the
                            proprietor of the hotel where I was staying at considerable length on
                            this subject. His occupation brought him into contact with men of many
                            different points of view. He said that personally he would be glad to
                            see a revolution, as he thought it would force the issue and he wanted
                            peace at any cost. His profitable business he would willingly see ruined
                            if that would bring peace, but the people of Austria and Hungary he said
                            might strike for wages, or even fight against the profiteers and
                            capitalists, but they would never take arms against their King (Carl is
                            the King of Hungary and <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0123"/>Emperor
                            of Austria). The barber who shaved me, an elderly man, has a son who
                            went to Texas and is now in the United States army, and another son
                            fighting in the Austrian army. As one of the people he has the inherited
                            sentiment for his King, something akin to that felt by Americans for
                            their flag. He said there would be no resistance to the Government, but
                            the people would go as far as they could to have peace. He, himself,
                            hated the Germans, who he thought were responsible for this war. This
                            expression of hatred of the German war party seems general. Dr. Julius
                            Offner, whose philanthropy has gained for him the devotion of the common
                            people, does not believe revolution could ever proceed beyond its
                            incipiency in either Austria or Hungary. There is much discontent and a
                            sensational orator might secure a temporary following.</p>
                        <p>Having stated some of the results of my interviews in Vienna and
                            Budapest, I give below the reasons for going to those places.</p>
                        <p>In 1915, I was in Berlin for several weeks in connection with obtaining
                            dye stuffs from Germany for interests in the United States and for the
                            Bradford Dyers Association of England. The latter company had been
                            probably the largest purchasers of German dyes in the world and at that
                            time held a Royal License from the Crown in England to trade with the
                            enemy on this particular commodity. In this way I became intimately
                            acquainted with German officials and some of the industrial barons
                            there, so far that I was entertained in their homes; also with
                            connections of theirs in Holland, some of whom were parties to the <hi
                                rend="italic">pro-forma</hi> contracts made on the dye stuff
                            business. These channels and the acquaintance I had with Count Apponyi
                            when he was in this country, gave me opportunities for obtaining
                            information of value and I offered my services to the Government. I
                            foretold of the proposal of the Pope before it was made public and knew
                            the source of its inspiration, which has since been confirmed. In
                            Holland, from residence there and from some of my German acquaintances
                            who came there, I learned of, and cabled to this Government advance
                            information regarding plans for constitutional changes in Germany, the
                            proposed appointment of a non-militarist Chancellor, and other matters,
                            some of which have already been accomplished. Through one of my German
                            acquaintances, I was presented to a member of the Austrian Legation at
                            The Hague, who told me of the Emperor Carl’s support of the new Peoples’
                            Party in Germany and the Emperor’s regret that diplomatic relations had
                            been severed with the United States because misunderstandings had arisen
                            between the two countries. These items I cabled to the Department at the
                            time. At a second meeting with the member of the Austrian Legation, I
                            told him of my desire to meet Count Apponyi unofficially and that I had
                            telegraphed Count Apponyi from <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0124"
                            />The Hague asking if a meeting could be arranged at some neutral point
                            but had received no answer. I told him of my acquaintance with Count
                            Apponyi in America and that I would like to consult with him as to the
                            possibility of establishing his idea of an international parliament
                            subsequent to the war. I had discussed this subject with him when he was
                            in the United States in 1910. I felt sufficiently acquainted with Count
                            Apponyi to send him such a telegram and thought I could not serve my
                            Government better than to obtain an interview with him. This was in
                            October last before any declaration of war against Austria-Hungary. The
                            member of the Legation said he would talk with his chief and consult the
                            Foreign Office and Count Apponyi. I went to London and back before
                            seeing him again, but on my return he told me that Count Apponyi would
                            be glad to meet me if I could go to Switzerland, as it would take more
                            time for him to go to Holland and he could not be absent from his duties
                            for so long. They wanted my reply if I would go to Switzerland and for
                            me to name the day I would meet him there, so that he could arrange in
                            advance for his absence. Berne was the place appointed and Saturday,
                            November 24th, the day. I did not arrive until Sunday, November 25th. On
                            Saturday the 24th, Karolyi arrived at Berne. On the 25th, he asked to
                            have an interview with Mr. Wilson, Chargé d’Affaires <hi rend="italic"
                                >ad interim</hi> of our Legation at Berne. I thought at that time
                            that Apponyi and Karolyi were co-workers, as they had been before. (I
                            found out my mistake afterward.) But due to the coincidence of Karolyi
                            arriving on the day set for meeting Apponyi, I supposed he had come in
                            his stead. I went to the Austrian Legation from my train that Sunday
                            evening to announce my arrival and learned that Karolyi was in town.
                            They had been advised from the Legation at The Hague and by the Foreign
                            Office at Vienna of my coming and the object of my visit. The secretary
                            took me in his own car to the house of the Minister, Baron Mousselin,
                            who thought he should not interfere in any way with Count Karolyi’s
                            intentions, but advised my going to Karolyi’s hotel and advising him of
                            my arrival. I did so, but only saw his secretary, who was very anxious I
                            should see his chief. I waited some time but did not see him at all. He
                            saw Wilson that same Sunday evening and you have the substance of his
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>Apponyi was repeatedly prevented from coming to Berne. Cabinet matters
                            were at a crisis then. On Tuesday, December 4th, a telegram came stating
                            that Count Apponyi could not come to Berne, that he would send a Mr. De
                            Pukovics to represent him, or, if I could come to Austria to see him, I
                            would receive a safe conduct from the Foreign Office within 48 hours and
                            I could come to Vienna. Knowing that my real object to get information
                            for my Government would be defeated <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79"
                                facs="0125"/>if I did not meet Apponyi himself, I cabled to
                            Washington that I was offered a safe-conduct and would proceed to Vienna
                            unless advised of the Government’s disapproval before leaving. This
                            cable I handed in at the Legation on Tuesday, but learned afterwards it
                            was not sent out until Wednesday morning. My safe-conduct papers were
                            issued on Thursday but I did not start until Friday p. m. Mr. Wilson
                            advised me not to go. The banker who furnished me with Austrian money
                            told me the last Englishman who had gone in had not been heard from
                            since and the least that would happen to me would be to be interned
                            until the end of the war, if not ordered “to be shot before sunrise.” I
                            could not see why my Government could object if I was willing to take
                            the risk and do not yet understand why cables were sent later expressing
                            disapproval. The Austrian Legations and the Vienna Foreign Office knew
                            that I was acting unofficially and the safe conduct was granted to me
                            personally as a friend of Count Apponyi’s desiring to visit him. I
                            arranged on leaving Berne on Friday afternoon that Mr. Wilson could
                            reach me at Zurich if any later message came, and to make sure, I
                            telephoned him to Berne from Zurich late Friday night, but nothing had
                            been received. Saturday I went on and was then beyond recall and
                            proceeded to do what I considered my duty. I was treated with marked
                            courtesy everywhere, but traveling such long distances under present
                            conditions was a severe trial of endurance. I will not fill space with a
                            description of the discomforts.</p>
                        <p>The balance of this report embodies partly cables sent through the
                            Legation to the Department and particulars of interviews with Count
                            Apponyi from notes made after the interviews and approved when submitted
                            to him. At Budapest and Vienna most important interviews were held. The
                            description of Count Apponyi given me at the Vienna Foreign Office is
                            that he is the wise man of the age, one whose opinions are the outcome
                            of study and sifted evidence, which have for their bases confirmed facts
                            and that he is the broadest visioned aristocrat in the dual empire.</p>
                        <p>The remarkable accuracy of Count Apponyi’s predictions were commented on
                            by Count Coloredo-Mansfeld, Chief of the Foreign Office, who married
                            Miss Iselin of New York, and by Count Ambrozy, who was for nine years in
                            the Austrian Embassy at Washington.</p>
                        <p>In 1910, when Count Apponyi was in the United States, he said: “The next
                            outbreak would set the world on fire and even the United States might be
                            drawn into the vortex by the complications which would arise.” This
                            appears in Apponyi’s pamphlet published in 1911, in our Congressional
                            Library as pamphlet “JX 1963 A7 Apponyi”, which contains other counsel
                            of value and interest today. Apponyi is constantly consulted by Count
                            Czernin, who is his intimate <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0126"
                            />friend, as well as by the leaders of the new party in Germany, whose
                            strength and intentions are known to him. His universal knowledge and
                            experience exceptionally qualify him for his position in the Cabinet as
                            Minister of Education. My former reports to you from German sources of
                            the change in constitution and the plans for reforms are stated by him
                            to be in existence but these reforms he says must be established by
                            voluntary action on the part of the people. At Budapest our first
                            interview extended over two hours, after which Count Apponyi concluded
                            that we two should go to Vienna the next day and there he would consult
                            with Count Czernin, who had just returned from a trip to Berlin and I
                            would be presented by him to Count Czernin. This I felt constrained to
                            decline with regret, stating to Count Apponyi that my Government had
                            given consent to my meeting him unofficially but that until I had the
                            further approval of my Government, I should do nothing further than what
                            it already had knowledge of. Apponyi then stated that he would have
                            something further to say to me after seeing Count Czernin. The notes
                            made on our first interview and confirmed by Count Apponyi, follow:
                            Without any allusion to this subject by me, Count Apponyi was most
                            emphatic in stating that Austria-Hungary would never make any separate
                            peace that did not include Germany. “It was not to be thought of.” He
                            mentioned Galicia, Transylvania and Italy and that the Germans had saved
                            them at those three points. It would be “infamy worse than could be
                            described” for them to separate from Germany. He believes a peace that
                            would be acceptable to the Entente can be had now. Victory for the
                            Entente is possible on the terms of the “Wilson policy”. He referred to
                            recent speeches by Count Czernin and by von Kuehlmann, which he
                            considers of great importance and significance. He said Kuehlmann’s
                            speech implied concessions in regard to Belgium and other items of
                            disagreement between the belligerents. He said guarantees would be given
                            and required by both sides. The people of the Central Powers desire
                            peace and have declared that they are in favor of a reduction of
                            armament and arbitration of disputes.</p>
                        <p>He thinks it a great mistake that the proposal for a conference made in
                            December 1916 was not acted upon then. No one was committed or bound to
                            any conditions but much would have been gained. If the contending
                            parties could meet together, there might be obstacles to agreement at
                            first, but in one or two days or in one or two weeks they might one by
                            one disappear.</p>
                        <p>He says there is much misunderstanding in regard to existing conditions
                            in Germany in respect to democratization. The election to the Reichstag
                            “rests upon the broadest franchise that exists throughout <pb n="81"
                                xml:id="pg_81" facs="0127"/>the world and is absolutely without
                            corruption.” Election expenses as understood in England and America are
                            scarcely known in Germany. Every male of the population has his vote for
                            his representative in the Reichstag. Reforms are proposed and being
                            considered in regard to the Prussian body, but the Reichstag is the
                            voice of the people. “No Chancellor can now exist who has not the good
                            will of the Reichstag.” He said the Reichstag is for peace and not for
                            war. Whether the reforms proposed for enfranchisements in the Landtag
                            are accomplished or not (and they will be), that body can not affect the
                            vote of the Reichstag any more than a vote of the New York Legislature
                            can affect the vote of the National Congress.</p>
                        <p>He was greatly disappointed when the United States went into the war with
                            Germany and many of his countrymen do not feel convinced that the real
                            aim of the United States is to change the constitutional government of
                            Germany. One reason why they do not believe that to be the aim is
                            because the leading statesmen of the United States must know that change
                            of government can only be brought about from the inside and not from
                            without. “Democracy must come as a friend.” The hostile action at this
                            time is disturbing and not helping Democracy. He also regrets that the
                            United States went into the war, because he hoped that they would have
                            remained impartial and in a position to act as a fair judge in the final
                            settlement. He says the war party in Germany is in the minority and the
                            peace party has a very large majority. The quotations from, extremists
                            that have been circulated so widely in England and the United States
                            (from writings by Nietzsche, Treitschke, Bernhardi and others),
                            purporting to represent the views of the German people and their worship
                            of the war god are what might be collected from the extreme eccentric
                            writers of any country and be equally misleading.</p>
                        <p>He thinks militarism is not now confined to any country and the adjective
                            should be changed from German militarism to international militarism. It
                            is prevailing in all countries now. France has had for many years the
                            burden of a military establishment too great for her population. With a
                            smaller population than Germany, she has tried to maintain as large an
                            army. He said France’s army has done well and German experts commend
                            several of their achievements, but Germany had undoubtedly made the best
                            use of her military organization.</p>
                        <p>In Vienna the morning after returning from Budapest, I received a
                            telephone call from Count Apponyi to the effect that he would see me at
                            4 p. m., as he had been commanded to be in attendance at the Royal
                            Closet that day. It was reported in the papers by the Havas <pb n="82"
                                xml:id="pg_82" facs="0128"/>Agency that Emperor Charles received on
                            Friday Count Czernin and that Count Apponyi was present.</p>
                        <p>The second interview with Apponyi took place after he had been in
                            consultation with Emperor Charles and Count Czernin and was much longer
                            than the first. Beside the statements made by Count Apponyi at this
                            time, he gave me a written statement over his own autograph, which will
                            be appended later. He said the declaration of war by the United States
                            has had a depressing effect upon the people. Apponyi himself can not
                            understand the action of the United States in declaring war on
                            Austria-Hungary, as nothing has occurred to warrant it since the time of
                            our declaration of war against Germany. He said the unfounded optimism
                            of Lloyd George (which has been somewhat curbed since then) is due
                            either to a desire to mislead his own people or to blind ignorance of
                            existing conditions. Victory for the Allies can now be secured on what
                            might be termed the “Wilson policy”. Only butchery of the fighting
                            forces can be the result of Lloyd George’s present policy. This referred
                            to his policy as declared before January 5th. Apponyi says that if peace
                            is made with Russia it will result in the release to Germany of
                            2,000,000 fighting men who are trained to their duties. He took his
                            pencil and figured that before America could put that number in the
                            field, at least 1½ years would expire. If such a number were now ready,
                            it would mean the transportation each month of 110,000 men and supplies
                            for them. He thinks it is the belief of Lloyd George that the war will
                            be won by excess in numbers, but if so, the Central Powers will have the
                            advantage. He does not think that this war will be ended by battles but
                            by agreement and any advantage in fighting lies in superior efficiency.
                            A victory for the Allies according to the Wilson policy can now be
                            secured and the war stopped if the following can be arranged:</p>
                        <p>A conference, consisting of one representative each of France, England,
                            United States, Austria-Hungary and Germany (and Italy if insisted upon)
                            should be held either openly or secretly. No change is to occur pending
                            the deliberations of this conference. No cessation of hostilities. No
                            one is to be committed beforehand to acceptance of any terms. It would
                            be what might be termed a meeting of the respective counsel of litigants
                            without prejudice. The conference may disband and no harm is done, if it
                            is their conviction that no agreement can be reached. He says the Kaiser
                            will not resist the Reichstag, which is the voice of the people, and the
                            Reichstag is for peace.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the supply of food, he said I could see that there was not
                            plenty but that a supply sufficient to last will be conserved by
                            limitation of consumption. He says the largest winter seed sowing <pb
                                n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0129"/>that has ever been known has been
                            made and is now being protected and fertilized by the early and very
                            deep snows that now cover Austria-Hungary.</p>
                        <p>He said that obedience to any ruling international organization could be
                            made compulsory. If the present world-wide economic distress could be
                            concentrated against one offending power by international cooperation,
                            it would compel obedience. Apponyi has long advocated international
                            concerted action, but says that is a subject to be considered in the
                            future. The autographed statement he gave me is as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote"><p>“I insist on the two facts below:</p>
                            <p>First: As stated by the Foreign Secretary Czernin in his speech
                                lately delivered at Budapest, international arbitration, reduction
                                of armaments and, in a general way, the setting up of an
                                international machinery to prevent war is the official program of
                                Austria-Hungary: it has been sanctioned by the Hungarian Parliament
                                and accepted by Germany when the Chancellor (or the Foreign
                                Secretary) declared himself in perfect sympathy with Czernin’s
                                statement.</p>
                            <p>Second: Simply to try how difficulties could be set aside in a spirit
                                of mutual good will, without any previous acceptance of certain
                                conditions of peace, the Central Powers are always ready to accept a
                                peace conference of representatives of the belligerents. It is
                                France and England that decline even conversation of this unbinding
                                nature. Pacifists are denounced as enemies of their country and even
                                prosecuted legally in England and in France.</p>
                            <p>Democratic reforms, or reforms of any kind, if they are brought to us
                                on the point of an enemy’s sword will always be rejected with scorn,
                                even by the most advanced parties in our countries. The natural
                                evolution towards democracy in these countries is greatly
                                discouraged by their being made part of the war program of our
                                enemies.</p>
                            <p rend="right">Signed: Albert Apponyi”</p></quote>
                        <p>While I was at the Vienna Bank Verein, Count Anton Apponyi, nephew of
                            Albert, entered as a customer of the bank and Mr. Drucker of the bank,
                            who is a friend and great admirer of Mr. Penfield, introduced me to him.
                            My interviews with Albert Apponyi were known to Anton, who spoke of them
                            before Mr. Drucker and the latter became very much interested. He said
                            that through Austro-Hungarian connections he was in touch with a number
                            of important interests and while Count Apponyi’s statements were to be
                            relied upon as exactly true, he thought I ought to get the views of men
                            of other parties. I told him that I was not there as a representative of
                            my Government or in any official capacity. He said, notwithstanding, he
                            wished to talk with me unofficially and expressed a desire that some of
                            the misunderstandings which he was of the opinion had been wilfully
                            spread abroad should be cleared up. <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"
                                facs="0130"/>According to him, 99 per cent, of the people of
                            Austria-Hungary are antagonistic to the Junker Party of Germany and
                            their only adherents in the dual empire are men who because of their
                            capital have been allowed to come in on financial deals and make profits
                            possible on account of the war.</p>
                        <p>It was Mr. Drucker’s desire that I should meet one man, Dr. Julius
                            Offner, one of the leading lawyers in Vienna, an authority on political
                            economy and he said he was world-renowned as a publicist and a great
                            philanthropist, beloved by the poor. I thought that his information
                            pertaining to the position of the masses would be valuable in view of
                            his being in touch with the common people. I met him with Mr. Drucker.
                            He said 95 per cent, of the Austro-Hungarian people were opposed to the
                            Junker or Pan-German Party of Germany. He was as emphatic as all others
                            that there was no possibility of permanent revolution, disintegration or
                            separation from Germany. He stated that the Junker Party, long in the
                            minority, were dwindling and losing the influence of those in authority
                            in Germany. What Count Apponyi had stated about election to the
                            Reichstag was confirmed by him and he said the power of the Bundesrat to
                            dissolve the Reichstag had never been exercised, that without the
                            cooperation of two other Kingdoms, members of the German Empire, the
                            Kaiser did not control the Bundesrat. He said that the Landtag at
                            present was unfairly enfranchised but would be reformed by the Bill
                            which has already been drawn. According to him, the Kaiser is a changed
                            man. He said a tendency to make a powerful commercial man the Prime
                            Minister is in evidence. He has a thorough knowledge of the German
                            Government and German politics and said if I would submit a list of
                            questions pertaining to the German political bodies through any of the
                            Austro-Hungarian Legations, they would be answered by him through the
                            same medium.</p>
                        <p>Upon my return from Vienna to Bern I learned of the Government’s cables
                            of disapproval, of the instructions for me to inform the Austrian
                            Legation that I went to Austria without the consent and against the
                            wishes of the American authorities, and for me to proceed to London and
                            await further instructions. Later in London I received instructions to
                            return to America and report to the State Department, in accordance with
                            which I am here at the present time.</p>
                        <p>I regret exceedingly having acted contrary to the wishes of my Government
                            and certainly would have obeyed instructions if they had been received
                            before I left. The Austrian authorities distinctly understood that I
                            acted on my own initiative. On my final statement to <pb n="85"
                                xml:id="pg_85" facs="0131"/>them in accordance with your
                            instructions as above, the secretary of their Legation at Berne told me
                            that if desired they would give me in writing the statement: that from
                            the first I had told them I was acting unofficially and not as a
                            representative of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>However, I cannot but feel that it is fortunate I did not receive the
                            instructions as my information is quite positive that no separate peace
                            will be made with the Entente, but that the German Peace Party is in a
                            strong majority and have agreed with Count Czernin as to terms they will
                            consent to, which terms are not now vague as claimed by Lloyd George in
                            his speech of January 5th. Further than this, if the Entente will
                            consent to the unbinding conference suggested, encouragement will be
                            given to the democratic movement in Germany and Austria and Hungary will
                            become the Allies of President Wilson in support of his policy as now
                            declared.</p>
                        <p>Count Czernin has been consistent from the start and today confirms what
                            he stated March 30th 1917, (a few days before we declared war against
                            Germany) in the following words:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“As soon as our enemies abandon their unreasonable ideas of smashing
                                us up; as soon as they are ready to negotiate for a peace honorable
                                to them and to us, nothing stands in the way of negotiation.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>In regard to my sources of information in Holland, I would say that two
                            of my German acquaintances are in the Kriegsministerium and naturally
                            belong to the military party. The senior of the two has a son-in-law in
                            Holland who has talked with me rather freely, but firmly believes that
                            though battles may be lost and won Germany will never suffer military
                            defeat. Two others are commercial men with large connections who look on
                            conditions from the economic standpoint. They feel that the commercial
                            defeat is of greater consequence to the Nation and are strong advocates
                            for peace with no annexations and have fullest communication with the
                            Peace Party in Germany. The Hollanders I know are some of them
                            pro-German but for peace. Since Lloyd George’s withdrawal from his
                            knockout “blow” attitude and the assurance now given that it is proposed
                            that Germany shall have equal economic advantages with other nations, it
                            would be valuable to obtain the present views through these sources, and
                            I would like to return soon to Holland for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The above report made at your request is respectfully submitted.</p>

                            for the delay in preparing the enclosed memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The problem of our army is a vital one and its speedy and favorable
                            solution is the more urgently needed, as the French officers, interested
                            in the affair, are getting rather impatient. I sincerely hope that after
                            having so kindly taken charge of the Polish question, you will make of
                            it a brilliant personal success.</p>
                        <p>Thanking you most warmly for the generous interest in the cause of our
                            national revival, I beg to remain</p>

                            <p>Recognizing the political and strategic necessity of a Polish
                                national fighting force on the side of the Allies, on the Western
                                front, the French Government issued a decree, dated June 5, 1917,
                                signed by President Poincaré, calling to life an Autonomous Polish
                                National Army in France. In August last, a special Franco-Polish
                                Military Mission arrived in this country for the purpose of
                                recruiting volunteers from among the Polish residents of the United
                                States, and started at once an active propaganda. The Polish
                                residents, however, though desirous of fighting for the independence
                                of their State, as proclaimed by the President, the Polish
                                residents, led by absolute loyalty to this Government, wanted to
                                know, before enlisting, what would be the attitude of the
                                Administration towards this scheme. A Polish Military Commission was
                                appointed by the National Department in Chicago, the leading
                                political Polish organization in America, and steps were taken in
                                order to obtain official information about, and approval of the
                                plan.</p>
                            <p>On October 6, 1917, the War Department authorized the following:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It has been brought to the attention of the War Department that
                                    the Military Commission of the National Department of the Polish
                                    Central Relief Committee, located in Chicago, Illinois, intends
                                    to start, on October 7, 1917, an active campaign for recruiting
                                    for the Polish Army now engaged in fighting on the Western front
                                    in France.</p>
                                <p>The War Department has been advised that no individual of Polish
                                    nationality resident in the United States, who is in any way
                                    subject to the draft, will be accepted as a recruit by this
                                    Military Commission, <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0133"/>and
                                    that special care will be taken not to recruit any man whose
                                    family would be left without means of support.</p>
                                <p>Having in mind the attitude of this Government toward a United
                                    and independent Poland the War Department is glad to announce
                                    that it is entirely in accord with the proposed plans of this
                                    Military Commission and that the Department trusts that this
                                    recruiting campaign, looking to the strengthening of the Polish
                                    army already fighting in association with the armies now in
                                    France, will be a success.”</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>On October 7, 1917, recruiting offices in various centers were
                                opened—their number being now forty-one—and the enlistment had
                                begun. Up to this moment 10,200 volunteers have joined the Polish
                                army.</p>
                            <p>Considering the tenor of the statement of the War Department, which
                                positively excludes from recruiting all the non-naturalized Poles
                                subject to the draft, and recommends not to accept any man
                                supporting his family, the results, so far obtained are truly
                                remarkable. The French authorities, however, who have spent large
                                sums of money for recruiting purposes, do not consider the number of
                                enlisted men as satisfactory. If the restrictions mentioned in the
                                statement of the War Department are not removed or modified, the
                                recruiting will be undoubtedly discontinued. From the military point
                                of view this would be regrettable, as the Poles are generally
                                regarded as the best fighting material in the world. Indeed, the
                                volunteers already enlisted, after only a fortnight of training, in
                                their camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada, have been declared by the
                                examining Canadian and French officers as “<hi rend="italic">troupes
                                    d’élite</hi>”, comparable solely to the best French soldiers
                                from the Department du Nord.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore the abandonment of the idea of a Polish National Army
                                fighting for the Allies’ cause, which has already attracted so much
                                attention and excited so much interest, would be exploited by the
                                enemy as another failure of the Entente powers, and its effect upon
                                the morale of the Polish people and soldiers still willing to fight
                                on the Russian front would be most depressing.</p>
                            <p>According to recent reports there are at Bobruysk, Province of Minsk,
                                over 80,000 Polish soldiers, perfectly disciplined, under the
                                command of General Dowbor-Musnicki, thus forming the nucleus of a
                                large Polish army whose possibilities should not be underestimated.
                                General Rampon is supposed to be at Bobruysk as the representative
                                of France at General Dowbor-Musnicki’s head-quarters.</p>
                            <p>Certain attention should be given to these important facts.</p>
                            <p rend="center">II</p>
                            <p>The idea of a Polish army in the United States as submitted to the
                                Administration at the very beginning of America’s entrance into the
                                war, was not due to the desire of creating a nationalistic movement
                                    <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0134"/>in this country, but, to
                                the firm belief that a large homogeneous and consequently efficient
                                military force, could effectively assist the United States in
                                winning her noble cause and, eventually, contribute to the
                                re-establishment of an independent Polish State.</p>
                            <p>To win a war means efficiency. There cannot be absolute efficiency in
                                an army where there is a lack of comprehension between soldiers and
                                officers, or among the soldiers themselves.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the entrance of the United States into the war, volunteers
                                have been flocking to the recruiting offices. The Polish boys who
                                were so eager to show their loyalty to this noble country, as well
                                as those, who, desirous of an immediate success, were equally eager
                                to enlist them, did not realize that they were adding to the
                                perplexity of the commanders and instructing officers.</p>
                            <p>The number of Polish boys who had arrived in this country shortly
                                before the war, and who do not understand or know English well, is
                                extremely large. Some cantonments contain from thirty to forty per
                                cent of them. In a militaristic empire possessing numerous cadres,
                                this would not much matter. Divided into small detachments, spread
                                over some 400 or 500 regiments, these foreign-born soldiers would be
                                quickly and automatically assimilated. But in this pacific Republic,
                                whose regular army has so far consisted of about one twentieth of
                                the number of Polish soldiers already wounded or killed on European
                                battlefields, the presence of such a numerous linguistically foreign
                                element in the training camps is certainly a drawback, retarding the
                                speedy formation of a fighting force so urgently needed. It
                                increases considerably the labor of the instructing officers; it
                                makes them impatient and nervous, causing in some cases, inevitable
                                severity, resulting always in humiliation. Besides, it creates
                                something incompatible with lofty principles of this country,
                                something utterly undemocratic, for it establishes two different
                                classes of soldiers; a privileged one, made up of those who
                                understand, and one, made up of those who do not understand. This is
                                manifestly to the detriment of the spirit of unity among the
                                fighters, especially as the Polish volunteers, assigned in many
                                cases, to kitchen police and other menial duties are too frequently
                                ridiculed by their fellow-soldiers.</p>
                            <p>Evidences of the facts above mentioned have been gathered not only
                                from private informations and numerous complaints, but also frankly
                                acknowledged by distinguished American officers and even confirmed
                                by a high authority.</p>
                            <p>Considering:</p>
                            <p>A—That a separate Polish National Army is a recognized political and
                                strategic necessity;</p>
                            <p>B—That the superior value of Polish fighting material is generally
                                admitted;</p>
                            <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0135"/>
                            <p>C—That the Polish soldiers are imbued with a distinct ideal, as they
                                know that the existence of their ancestral country; is at stake,
                                while it is still extremely difficult to explain to an average
                                American, why he has to risk his life for the restoration of
                                Alsace-Lorraine or for the independence of Montenegro;</p>
                            <p>D—That at this grave moment everything causing embarrassment,
                                obstructing speedy progress of preparedness, impeding efficiency of
                                the army, should be removed without delay;</p>
                            <p>It seems indispensable that all the Poles not speaking English should
                                be united into one body, protected by the United States Government.
                                As to the definite solution of this problem it is respectfully
                                suggested that:<list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>Either the Polish soldiers not knowing enough English,
                                        already in the American army, as well as those subject to
                                        the forthcoming draft, should be incorporated in the Polish
                                        army in France, provided that the French Government would
                                        establish a statute for that “Autonomous Army” and not apply
                                        to it the regulations of the foreign legion.</item>
                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>Or all the Polish soldiers, non-speaking English should be
                                        put together as a separate unit and submitted to the
                                        exclusive control of the United States Government.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>In both instances the bringing over here from Russia of 400 to 500
                                experienced Polish officers, as promised already by the Russian
                                General Staff, would be imperatively needed.</p>
                            <p>The Poles fighting for the independence of their State will also
                                fight for the American ideals and they believe to be entitled to ask
                                this generous country for aid and protection.</p>

                            the telegrams from Rome indicating a measure of dissatisfaction or at
                            least of disappointment on the part of the Italian Government and people

                            Italy and presumably the statement in regard to Austria-Hungary. The
                            point which the Italians seem to make is that if their frontiers are to
                            be rectified only on the basis of nationality, they will be as
                            vulnerable to attack from Austria-Hungary as they have been in the past.
                            That is, the Adriatic Question will remain unsettled and will compel the
                            nation to continue its present policy of defense.</p>
                        <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0136"/>
                        <p>There is no doubt but that Italy’s position in the Adriatic is more or
                            less precarious and that it is one which the Italian Government seeks to
                            make more stable in the final peace. The Italian coast is low-lying and
                            without harbors. It offers no opportunities for naval bases from which
                            to operate. On the other hand, the opposite coast is indented with
                            numerous inlets and ports. As a consequence the Italian shores are
                            difficult of defense and control of the Adriatic lies to a very
                            considerable degree with the power possessing the eastern shores of the
                            sea.</p>
                        <p>Manifestly an adjustment of the Italian frontiers along lines of
                            nationality will in no way cure this situation or make Italy’s position
                            more secure than it is at present. I think that this is the ground for
                            Italian dissatisfaction, and it is not entirely without
                            justification.</p>
                        <p>While, as you know, I am strongly inclined to nationality as the basis
                            for territorial limits I believe that it cannot be invariably adopted,
                            but that in certain cases physical boundaries and strategic boundaries
                            must be considered and modify boundaries based on nationality. These
                            will constitute exceptions to the general rule but will be very few in
                            number.</p>
                        <p>I mention this at the present time because I fear that if Italy gains the
                            impression that she is not to strengthen her position in the Adriatic,
                            the Italian people will become discouraged and feel that the war has no
                            actual interest for them, that they will be disposed to make peace
                            provided the Germans and Austrians retire from Italian territory, and
                            that they will consider themselves to have been abandoned by this
                            country and the Allies. With the present political situation in Italy
                            and the depression following their military reverses such an impression
                            would be most unfortunate and might be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>Do you not think that something could be done to restore Italian
                            confidence that a satisfactory settlement of the Adriatic Question will
                            be made at the peace conference? If anything can be done it seems to me
                            it ought to be done without delay.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The clear and explicit
                            declaration of war aims contained in your address of January 8th has
                            brought forth no corresponding declaration from the German Government.
                            They have never made a definite statement of terms which would satisfy
                            them, but have preferred to criticize the declarations of their enemies
                            leaving <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0137"/>their own aims uncertain.
                            Even in the discussion of the addresses of yourself and of Lloyd George
                            the Imperial Chancellor is, I believe intentionally, ambiguous, vague
                            and careful to avoid making reply to certain propositions which might
                            embarrass Germany with her allies.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that we are not getting the full benefit of your candid
                            declaration of aims unless we point out that the German Government has
                            never frankly stated their aims and are apparently unwilling to do so. I
                            think that in some way, by an address, a letter or other means, you
                            should challenge them to do this, possibly going so far as to challenge
                            them to answer specific questions such as—What is the German purpose as
                            to Belgium? What reparation will Germany make as to the occupied regions
                            of Belgium and France? What is Germany’s aim as to Alsace-Lorraine? What
                            is Germany’s attitude as to the independence of Poland, and what
                            territories is it proposed to include in the new nation? What is
                            Germany’s aim as to the Baltic provinces of Russia? Does Germany insist
                            that Armenia shall remain under Turkish rule and that Palestine shall be
                            restored to the Turks? Questions such as these if unanswered will place
                            Germany in an unenviable light before the world, and I am convinced that
                            they will be unanswered.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that there is an opportunity to weaken very materially the
                            German peace propaganda by showing that, while they seek our war aims,
                            they are unwilling to disclose their own.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: On November 10, 1917, this
                            Government recognized the Polish National Committee with headquarters in
                            Paris and with representatives in France, Italy, Switzerland, Great
                            Britain and the United States. Mr. Paderewski is the representative of
                            the Committee in this country. Previous to recognition by this
                            Government, the Polish National Committee had been recognized by Great
                            Britain, France and Italy. The avowed purpose of the Committee is to
                            further the cause of a united and independent Poland in allied countries
                            and in the United States. The Committee’s status cannot be considered
                            that of a Provisional Government. Whatever formal character it may have
                            is the result of recognition by the above mentioned countries.</p>
                        <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0138"/>
                        <p>Up to the present time our recognition of this Committee has been,
                            without doubt, justified at least by the efforts of Mr. Paderewski and
                            his associates in this country.</p>
                        <p>I attach herewith a letter and a memorandum<note n="62" xml:id="d65fn1">
                                <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_86">p.
                                86</ref>.</note> sent me by Mr. Paderewski concerning, among other
                            things, the recruiting of Poles not subject to the draft in this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I have been reliably informed that the efforts of the Polish National
                            Committee in the allied countries have been equally successful along
                            somewhat different lines. Moral support has been secured in England and
                            in Italy for the cause of an independent Poland and in addition to this
                            in France the Committee working in conjunction with the French
                            Government has constituted a small but determined force of men who are
                            willing to fight for the cause represented by the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The work of this Committee will be seriously crippled unless funds now
                            are provided by the Allies and the United States. Up to the present time
                            the Committee has been financed by private subscriptions.</p>
                        <p>Within the last few weeks I have received several memoranda from the
                            British Embassy requesting to be advised of this Government’s attitude
                            towards furnishing financial aid in conjunction with Great Britain to
                            the Polish National Committee for the relief of Polish refugees in
                            Russia, the necessities of the Polish Army and the continuation of the
                            organizations of the Polish National Committee in the allied countries
                            and in the United States. I hesitated to submit the matter to you until
                            I heard direct from Mr. Paderewski.</p>
                        <p>I attach herewith a letter I received from him a few days ago.<note

                        <p>Mr. Paderewski asks for financial assistance for three distinct
                            purposes:</p>
                        <p>1—Polish National Committee expenses.</p>
                        <p>2—Relief of Polish refugees in Russia.</p>
                        <p>3—Five hundred thousand dollars for the purpose of bringing certain
                            Polish officers from Russia to assist in the Polish Army.</p>
                        <p>If you approve I shall take up (2) with the Red Cross and (3) with the

                            practicable.</p>
                        <p>I have been informally advised that with respect to (1) the British
                            Government will be glad to share these expenses with this Government.
                            The view of the British Government is that it is highly desirable to
                            keep in close touch with the activities of the Polish National
                            Committee, not only for present purposes, but on account of <pb n="93"
                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0139"/>obvious advantages to be gained
                            ultimately when peace negotiations are being carried on. I entirely
                            agree with this view. At the present time I believe that considerable
                            assistance can be obtained through this organization in securing
                            political and military information concerning the Central Powers for the
                            use of this Government. The agents of the Polish National Committee have
                            peculiar advantages in securing such information on account of their
                            activities in Sweden and Switzerland and at the Vatican.</p>
                        <p>My thought is that if you are willing to advance from your war fund, say,
                            a maximum of thirty thousand dollars a month to be placed under the
                            control of an agent of this Department who would be attached to the
                            American Embassy at Paris and to be used by him to assist the
                            organizations of the Polish National Committee (a like sum to be
                            provided by the British Government under the supervision of one of its
                            agents), the understanding being that the Polish National Committee in
                            return therefor will secure and place at the disposal of the British
                            Government and this Government all information of a political and
                            military character secured by its agents, great benefit would accrue
                            therefrom both to the Polish National Committee and to the Governments
                            of Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I know of no other way by which the assistance requested by Mr.
                            Paderewski can be furnished by this Government, inasmuch as the Treasury
                            Department is not authorized to lend money except to established
                            governments at war with the Central Powers.</p>
                        <p>I shall be grateful to you if you can furnish me with your directions
                            with respect to the foregoing.</p>

                            limited my statement about Italian rights as I did because I was taking
                            my programme as a whole, including the league of nations through which
                            mutually defensive pledges were to be given and taken which would render
                            strategic considerations such as those affecting the Adriatic much less
                            important. I told him that, failing a league of nations, my mind would
                            be open upon all such matters to new judgments.</p>
                        <p>I am clear that I could not pledge our people to fight for the eastern
                            shore of the Adriatic; but there is nothing in what I have omitted to
                            say to alarm the Italian people, and it ought to be possible for Orlando

                            it unwise for Mr. Crosby to act in a matter which is chiefly political
                            rather than financial. Do you not think it would be well to speak to

                            of Crosby’s taking part in any such action in the future. The
                            Inter-Allied Board was certainly not constituted to give political
                            advice.</p>

                            to the recent action of the Supreme War Council with regard to
                            conditions of peace and to this action of the Inter-Allied Board with
                            regard to the recognition of the Bolshevik authorities:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>That the President wishes very respectfully but very earnestly to
                                urge that when he suggested the creation of the Inter-Allied Board
                                and gave his active support to the creation of the Supreme War
                                Council it was not at all in his mind that either of these bodies
                                should take any action or express any opinion on political subjects.
                                He would have doubted the wisdom of appointing representatives of
                                this Government on either body had he thought that they would
                                undertake the decision of any questions but the very practical
                                questions of supply and of the concerted conduct of the war which it
                                was understood they should handle. He would appreciate it very much
                                if this matter were very thoroughly reconsidered by the political
                                leaders of the Governments addressed and if he might be given an

                            safeguard ourselves in this all-important matter. Perhaps you will think
                            it best to communicate these views through the diplomatic

                                Lloyd George’s speeches relating to Italian war-aims fell so far
                                short of what Italy desires and what her Government and Press have
                                led her people to expect that there has been a tremendous stir here
                                about Italy’s aims and claims, at least on the part of the people
                                who write and talk about such things. This has resulted in strong
                                currents of critical feeling about America and England, and the
                                propaganda which has been going on for months against England is, I
                                learn, now sufficiently broadened to include America also. I believe
                                that this is a part of the almost universal German propaganda which
                                covers the world, but undoubtedly a good many Italians are being
                                drawn in to take part in it. Happily for us, a great many Italians
                                have been equally aroused to resist this propaganda. These last,
                                however, are continually bringing to our attention the importance of
                                our taking some steps ourselves to countervail this anti-American,
                                anti-Democratic propaganda. And I agree with them fully in thinking
                                that it is a matter of great importance that we should set ourselves
                                seriously to this work. I have on a number of occasions sent
                                telegrams about this matter, more or less urgent, but so far I have
                                apparently had little success in impressing my views on whoever the
                                matter has been referred to at home. I suggested making an
                                appropriation of funds, reasonable enough one would think; for in
                                the beginning I suggested something like $2,500. Later I suggested
                                the great effect that it would have to send a Military Mission, or a
                                Mission of Military Observers to the Italian Front. The response was
                                a suggestion of sending a distinguished newspaper or war
                                correspondent just made into a Reserve Captain to represent America
                                where all the other Allies were represented by trained military men
                                in Commissions of <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0143"/>from six to
                                a dozen members each with Generals, or at least Colonels at their
                                head. This was far worse than nothing, and would undoubtedly have
                                been considered by the people here as a slight and possibly an
                                intentional slight. The absence of a Mission of Military Observers
                                here is often commented on, though naturally not to me, by Italians
                                who say they have enrolled a greater number of men to their
                                population than France has done; that they have lost over a million
                                men; that they have until just recently borne a greater weight
                                thrown against them per kilometer of front without any assistance
                                whatever than any other of the Allies; that they have suffered more
                                than any of the Western Allies in privation, and as much in battle
                                losses.</p>
                            <p>A great part of this is true. The Italian people have suffered and
                                are suffering tremendously. Moreover, another claim which they put
                                forward insistently is well-founded: that Italy’s front is as
                                important to the Allied cause as the French front; that if Italy’s
                                front should be broken and Italy forced to make peace France would
                                be lost as definitely as if the French front were forced. Now the
                                security of Italy’s front rests upon first her troops at the front,
                                and secondly the endurance of her people, and it is this endurance
                                which the propaganda to which I have alluded above is addressed on
                                the part of the Germans and of those Italians who allow themselves
                                to be used in this German propaganda. The military situation appears
                                for the present to be very good, although I understand the
                                propaganda is again working to some extent even in the trenches. The
                                dangerous point is the failure to meet the economic situation in
                                Italy with sufficient food supplies, coal supplies and other
                                supplies of the necessaries of life.</p>
                            <p>I have sent you by this mail a letter written by David Lubin,<note
                                    n="67" xml:id="d70fn2">Not found in Department files.</note> the
                                American Representative at the International Institute of
                                Agriculture, giving the views of a number of important Italian
                                public men on this point, and I commend those views to serious
                                consideration. The number of men at present under arms in Italy, is
                                I believe somewhat exaggerated, though I learn that Italy has
                                enrolled about 4,300,000 men of which she has lost about a million,
                                one half of them, about, being prisoners in Austria. But the main
                                facts stated by these men is the importance of saving Italy to the
                                Allied cause. And whatever may be said of certain elements who are
                                against Democracy and who are at heart more friendly to Germany, if
                                reports are to be believed, than they are to America, the Italians
                                at large beginning with the King and concluding with the great body
                                of the plain <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0144"/>people are
                                believers in Liberty. And it is to stand by them and to overthrow
                                those who are carrying on the German propaganda that we should take
                                effective steps, the most effective in our power.</p>
                            <p>The declaration of war against Austria was a tremendous stimulus
                                here. There was an element undoubtedly which was far from wishing us
                                to take this step and which has resented our doing so, but the
                                Italian people and many of their best leaders know what it has done
                                for Italy, however the press may be engaged at present in fomenting
                                criticism of us because the President did not go further in his
                                message, and announced that Italy ought to have all her Government
                                has claimed. The sending of troops here would be the greatest
                                propaganda that could be started. Even a small number of troops with
                                the flag would count for much. But undoubtedly there would be
                                expectations that that small number would ultimately be increased. I
                                could not tell you how many men have said to me personally what I
                                have heard several say in public speeches: If America would only
                                send her flag—her starry flag it would be a symbol not only to Italy
                                but to the world that America recognizes that Italy is fighting for
                                freedom, for Liberty and has the same ideals that America has.</p>
                            <p>Believe me, Mr. Secretary, it would have an immense moral effect. It
                                would have an immense effect not only for the present and while the
                                war lasts,—but for years to come.</p>
                            <p>I know the difficulties that stand in the way of sending troops here,
                                but it is well worth all the trouble. It will bind Italy to America
                                in a way that nothing else on earth will.</p>
                            <p>Meantime, I ought to have the means placed in my hands to carry on a
                                reasonable propaganda here in Italy to show the Italians what
                                America and Americans are doing for Italy. We are doing it and it is
                                now [<hi rend="italic">not</hi>] known as it should be known. The
                                other Allies are engaged in pressing upon the attention of the
                                Italians what they are doing for them. We have no means here of
                                showing what we are doing, and about all they know is that we are
                                lending them money, selling them supplies by no means as much as
                                they need, or think their due proportion, and helping the other
                                Allies with everything including armies.</p>
                            <p>I urge you to have this matter given the most serious consideration.
                                No money could be spent which would bring so rich a return. There
                                are many more things which I would like to write you about, but for
                                the present I forbear.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Lansing</hi>: Since receiving the
                            Department’s telegram of January 12th.<note n="68" xml:id="d71fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> calling for weekly reports upon general conditions
                            existing in France, I have been impressed with the thought that I ought
                            to write you setting forth some fundamental facts underlying those
                            conditions, that a more intelligent understanding of those reports may
                            be had. I have preferred to put this communication in the form of a
                            personal letter to you rather than that of an official despatch, even
                            though I realize from my own experience during these busy days that
                            sometimes such letters—especially long ones—look very formidable and
                            uninviting.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, the weekly reports will only come to have any significance as
                            events over here vary from time to time.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, let me take this occasion to explain, referring to your
                            telegram N° 3171 of the 12th. instant,<note n="68" xml:id="d71fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> that in making my report in my N° 3136<note n="68"
                                xml:id="d71fn3">Not printed.</note> concerning the aeroplane raid,
                            and the rather full comment thereon, I, of course, had not in mind to
                            point out its military importance which, as you say, would not have
                            justified the space given it, but the marked influence which it had upon
                            the public mind in giving it new resolve to prosecute the war with
                            greater vigor.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact there are certain outstanding conditions which, in so
                            far as they affect France herself or her attitude toward America, will
                            not change with the week. If I write with considerable conviction in
                            setting forth some of my observations, it is because, with no
                            affectation of conceit, I trust, my position here has been of such a
                            nature that few if any men have had the opportunity to meet and talk
                            with more people from all over Europe prominent in public and private
                            life than myself. The geographical as well as political position of
                            Paris has made it a Mecca for nearly everybody having a mission.</p>
                        <p>Whatever particular phase passing events may give to political conditions
                            in France, thus far, one must above all recognize that her determination
                            to resist the enemy—indeed, to win the war if possible—has never been
                            questioned. The courage and sacrifice with which she has prosecuted that
                            determination are also conceded.</p>
                        <p>While it is undeniably true that occasionally, after some check in her
                            military operations resulting in a heavy loss of men, or the
                            discouraging fact of enemy victories on other fronts, there has come <pb
                                n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0146"/>a feeling of discouragement,
                            yet the rebound has always been strong and splendid. Perhaps owing to a
                            combination of the causes just mentioned, with unfavorable domestic
                            conditions like labor troubles, the morale of France was the most shaken
                            just preceding the arrival of the American troops in June of last year,
                            but like some magic tonic, with their arrival came a revival in
                            confidence and in the fighting spirit of France which from that moment
                            right up to the present has not diminished.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that you have from time to time read, particularly in the
                            American press, exaggerated stories of the weakening of the morale of
                            France. Rumors without much foundation have been crystallized by such
                            writers into facts portentous of very great consequences to the country.
                            One on our shores must have gotten the impression growing out of
                            disclosures in the Bolo and Caillaux affairs that the upper crust of
                            French politics is wholly corrupt; and that former Ministers must have
                            deliberately shielded powerful wrong doers. Yet it is my opinion that,
                            as a matter of fact, no one of the belligerent Powers has been more
                            conservative, more united, or more efficient than France, considering
                            all the difficulties to be encountered. And yet none of the larger
                            countries has suffered as much as she.</p>
                        <p>The devotion to country seems to be an attribute as innate to every
                            Frenchman, whether of high or low degree, as is his temperament. All
                            have suffered terribly in the loss of their sons. But a hundred of such
                            bereaved fathers have told me that they gloried in the sacrifice. This
                            feeling, if it were not so ideal and exalted in character, might be
                            called almost fanatical.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Delcassé, Minister for Foreign Affairs in my early days in Paris,
                            once told me that upon the walls of his schoolroom when a boy was placed
                            the motto adjuring the reverence for family ties, but above family and
                            everything else devotion to country. That motto is as a flaming sign in
                            the clouds for every Frenchman. It has brought to his children a
                            training and sense of duty ideal, and has made his patriotism superb.
                            Imbued with such feelings and in the recognition of such obligations to
                            their country, the people of France may be depended upon to carry out
                            their part, regardless of sacrifice, to advance the common cause of
                            their Allies. At the present moment, even in the face of the long
                            threatened attack of the German forces, the morale of this country is
                            perhaps better than it has been at any time since the beginning of the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Such, I believe, is the situation to-day as regards her dependability,
                            which is so important to the Allied Armies because it is upon her soil
                            alone that they can and must fight. All reports from time to time,
                            therefore, will recognize this situation.</p>
                        <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0147"/>
                        <p>In view of Department’s instructions to which reference has been made,
                            one other factor may be considered which I am certain is as unvarying in
                            its nature as the loyalty of France to herself—I refer to her relations
                            to America. It may be affirmed without any qualification that, since the
                            day of our entrance into the war, France has not only looked upon
                            America as her special friend but she has recognized in her help the one
                            aid without which the cause of the Allies must have failed. With an
                            affection and confidence unlimited, the French people as well as the
                            Government have manifested the greatest concern to please us, and have
                            shown the greatest deference to the views of President Wilson. Although
                            political factions wage bitter controversies between themselves, yet,
                            singularly enough, they unite in pronouncing President Wilson as the
                            particular champion of their Articles of Faith and the exponent of their
                            views. Such a situation is highly important at the present time because
                            of the renewed efforts which the Socialist Groups are making to
                            discredit the present Ministry and which, if successful, might have an
                            important bearing upon the conduct of the war itself.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, it also gives to the President a very great power and
                            influence in moulding the views of the Allies, particularly as they
                            affect the position of France.</p>
                        <p>The many anxious enquiries which I have received from members of the
                            Ministry, as well as those of the Parliament, as to what more France can
                            do to show her welcome to our American soldiers, are pathetic in their
                            solicitude. Their gratitude, amounting to almost reverence, which they
                            show to our people testifies to the absolute confidence which they
                            repose in our promises and aims.</p>
                        <p>In making these general observations, bearing, as it will be noted, upon
                            the two fundamentally important facts—the solidarity of France and her
                            attitude toward America—I have ignored making reference to various
                            rumors which, though seemingly qualifying my statements, nevertheless,
                            in my opinion, merit but little weight. The temptation to generalize
                            from single instances often leads to conclusions which are at entire
                            variance with the real situation. That, here and there, there have been
                            instances of some friction between the French people and some of our
                            workers, either civil or military, of overcharging on the part of French
                            storekeepers, or of complaints of dilatoriness on the part of French
                            officials, is doubtless true, but France is at war and was sorely tried
                            for nearly three years before we entered into it. Indeed, the marvel to
                            me is that she has through it all been able to play so well such an
                            important part.</p>
                        <p>If I ventured upon the role of a prophet—and in these days of rapid
                            change one man’s prophecy is as good as another’s—I would say <pb
                                n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0148"/>that in the telegraphic weekly
                            reports which are to follow, the political conditions of France would be
                            affected almost solely by the conduct of the Socialists. Unfortunately,
                            the prosecution of Caillaux and Malvy, with their past powerful
                            political connections, must be taken into account in adding new elements
                            of a very probable disquieting nature, however meritorious may be those
                            prosecutions or however great the guilt of the accused.</p>
                        <p>In considering the economic features to be embraced in such a report,
                            undoubtedly labor conditions and food supplies—the latter depending upon
                            the ever pressing tonnage question—will have to be most frequently
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>Commercial questions, both by the policy of our country in limiting
                            exports and the same policy practised by the French Government—again so
                            greatly dependent upon the tonnage question—must be of minor importance
                            in such reports.</p>
                        <p>In concluding, let me say that I hope, in my observations of such a very
                            general nature, that I may have acquainted you in such a manner with the
                            situation existing here that my letter will serve in some measure as an
                            elucidation of what my telegraphic reports, necessarily and desirably
                            brief, may set forth.</p>

                            orally asked whether the appeal of the International Committee should
                            not be answered in identic terms and also whether we would not agree

                            and will rather rejoice in a somewhat crude and cynical rejoinder to the

                            chief fear was that the matter would become public and be used by the
                            political enemies of Lloyd George for I understand that since the
                            parliamentary crisis has passed he is less disturbed.</p>
                        <p>Day before yesterday, the 20th, Jusserand came to see me. He was far more
                            excited than Lord Reading and showed considerable irritation that he had
                            not been warned beforehand. He said that you had received him recently
                            and had never mentioned the matter to him nor had you done so to
                            Reading, a fact which he considered most unfortunate. He said that he
                            was sure that “your rebuke” would be very badly received.</p>
                        <p>I told him that the Prime Minister must have known that this Government
                            did not consider that the Supreme War Council had to <pb n="104"
                                xml:id="pg_104" facs="0150"/>do with political subjects, that we had
                            no political representative on the Council and had no intention of
                            having one, and that it seemed an extraordinary proceeding to issue a
                            statement at Versailles which would give the impression that the War
                            Council had approved. I told him that in the event that the three Allied
                            Governments considered your assertion as to the scope of the two
                            Councils to be a rebuke, they had no one to blame but themselves and
                            that you had no other course but state plainly your views.</p>
                        <p>This did not seem to satisfy Jusserand at all, though his chief ground of
                            complaint seemed to be that you had not consulted him about the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday (Thursday) I had an interview with the Italian Ambassador. I
                            found him in a very different temper from the other Ambassadors. He
                            agreed that your attitude was quite correct, that Baron Sonnino fully
                            understood it, and that the latter had resisted so far as he was able
                            any joint action without first consulting this Government.</p>
                        <p>This is a brief résumé of my interviews.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I thought over last night
                            what course we should take in dealing with the communication which we
                            have been warned will arrive via Spain. It seems to me we might do this:
                            Give the text to our principal cobelligerents and say to them that
                            through the same channel as we received the communication we intend to
                            reply by asking whether the document has been submitted to the German
                            Government and, if so, whether it meets with its approval as no answer
                            could be made until we are advised of German knowledge or ignorance of
                            Austria’s action.</p>
                        <p>This would furnish an acknowledgment to Austria without saying we have
                            the communication under consideration, and I cannot see how it would
                            arouse any suspicion or cause any offense among the Allies. Then
                            whichever way Austria replies we will be in a position to do as we
                            please for either reply offers possibilities since we can avoid giving
                            any indication which one we desire.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Lansing</hi>: In my letter of last
                            week, in which I considered, first, the morale of the French Government
                            and people as it affects their courage and determination to vigorously
                            prosecute the war, and, second, their attitude toward the United States
                            and its participation in the war, I took occasion to refer to these two
                            factors as in their nature fundamental and little likely to become less
                            favorable.</p>
                        <p>After writing you this, it occurred to me that I might very properly
                            supplement that letter by the treating of a situation which has to do
                            with the standing of the present Ministry, and certain conditions that
                            have seemed of late to threaten its stability. Let me say, at the
                            outset, however, that even the fall of the Clemenceau Ministry would by
                            no means necessarily or with any degree of probability bring about a
                            change which would seriously affect either the morale of France or her
                            attitude toward us—most assuredly not the latter. Nevertheless, such a
                            change just at this time might be unfortunate in giving encouragement to
                            the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Since I took charge of this mission, late in the Fall of 1914, there have
                            been five radical changes in French Ministries. Each new one succeeded
                            the old one without any particular jar or weakening effect. However, it
                            is undeniable that both in the Ribot and Painlevé Ministries, the seeds
                            of their final overthrow—the last one remained in power but twenty
                            days—were sown at the very inception of their institution when no member
                            of any of the Socialist Groups, as had been the custom in the past,
                            became a part thereof. This precedent was followed in the constitution
                            of the present Ministry which has had to face, in addition, the bitter
                            hostility of the Socialists on account of their long-time animosity
                            toward Mr. Clemenceau himself. Only his strength with the army, and the
                            confidence which the mass of the French people seem to place in his
                            courage and integrity of purpose, have, thus far, been proof against
                            both the secret and open opposition of those forces.</p>
                        <p>As stated in my last weekly telegraphic report N° 3210 of the 18th
                                instant,<note n="73" xml:id="d76fn1">Not printed.</note> certain
                            complications other than what may be termed strictly political have come
                            to exert no little influence upon public opinion. Their effect
                            strengthen and at the same time weaken the present Government. <pb
                                n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0152"/>I refer to the revelations
                            growing out of the exposure of Bolo Pasha and Caillaux.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly the prosecution and conviction of Bolo Pasha, whose name for
                            the past six months has stood as a synonym for corrupt intrigues and
                            treason, has greatly popularized Clemenceau, and, for a time, the arrest
                            of Caillaux, involving somewhat the same charges,—possibly devoid of
                            financial corruption—added to his strength. But, apparently,
                            reconstructing their lines of offensive, the friends of the latter,
                            comprising substantially the whole of the Socialist Party, as well as
                            certain other strong influences whose identity seems to remain in the
                            background, are said to be at the present moment very active in their
                            efforts to overthrow the Clemenceau Ministry.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the carrying out of such plans, as I intimated in my
                            abovementioned telegram, one hears now very frequently of threatened
                            labor troubles involving strikes in munition plants, predicted to begin
                            in the near future. A very prominent member of the Chamber of Deputies,
                            at the head of a great Paris newspaper, told me yesterday that such
                            strikes were scheduled to take place on next Wednesday, the 27th.
                            instant. You have doubtless been an interested reader of the proceedings
                            of the Inter-Allied Labor Conferences now being held in London.</p>
                        <p>My informant told me also that a demand would be made upon the French and
                            English Governments for passports for an International Socialist
                            Conference—somewhat along the lines of that proposed last summer for
                            Stockholm—; in the event of a refusal to issue passports to delegates of
                            such a convention, the order for the strike would go forth at once.
                            Facts are gradually coming to light of how within the past few weeks
                            Clemenceau took most drastic steps in throttling a formidable strike in
                            a munition factory at its very beginning. It is said that he issued an
                            ultimatum that if the men quit work they would at once be marched to the
                            front. Evidently they preferred the rear, for they did not strike.</p>
                        <p>The same Deputy above-quoted informed me that everybody was afraid of
                            Clemenceau, and that his opponents in the Chamber, figuratively
                            speaking, mentioned his name only in whispers. It would seem that the
                            soubriquet given to him of “The Tiger” is not so inappropriate.</p>
                        <p>A humorous story was told by the same gentleman that even the President
                            waved aside two envoys—Frenchmen—who came recently up from the Queen
                            Mother of Spain—herself Austrian by descent but bitterly anti-German—to
                            talk of a peace proposition. The President, with no little haste and
                            embarrassment, referred these messengers to the Government. Later
                            Clemenceau, hearing of the incident, had the men arrested and put under
                            a watch near the Front.</p>
                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>As my informant is not a partisan of Clemenceau, it may be well
                            appreciated that his comments were not intended to be those of
                            praise.</p>
                        <p>However, the very courage and boldness of Clemenceau have attracted to
                            him the support of the Army, and that fact alone will, in my opinion,
                            operate as a very strong deterrent upon those who, if conditions were
                            different, might seek to overthrow him. I have even heard it stated that
                            the most prominent members of preceding Ministries are desirous of, if
                            not active in bringing about the fall of his Ministry. Some of these are
                            charged with no more serious offence than being altogether too lax in
                            dealing with offenders like Bolo and Caillaux, after having knowledge of
                            their intrigues. Undoubtedly, however, the resentment which they feel
                            toward a Ministry that has brought their names into prominence in
                            connection with such charges is very bitter.</p>
                        <p>My own observation has been that underlying the causes announced for the
                            overthrow of all the past Ministries during my stay here may be found
                            personal jealousies and animosities rather than differences in the
                            governmental policies. It is indeed fortunate that the patriotism and
                            good sense, so inherent in the mass of the French people,—as I pointed
                            out in my previous letter—have been as a sheet anchor of strength
                            against any harmful effects from such personal resentments of those in
                            the various Ministries that have come and gone. Momentous consequences,
                            even affecting the outcome of the war, might have otherwise
                            followed.</p>
                        <p>In a later letter, pursuing the purpose to acquaint you with certain
                            situations not liable to materially change from week to week, I shall
                            take occasion to inform you as to some of the economic conditions
                            existing in France—particularly in Paris—as they have to do with not
                            only the everyday life but their effect on the prosecution of the
                            war.</p>

                            through its secretary, has sent me the letter which I attach hereto.
                            This Committee makes two requests:</p>
                        <p>1—That passports be issued to representatives of the Committee to proceed
                            to Palestine via London or Paris as a part of a Commission composed of
                            representatives of the Zionist organization of England which is acting
                            with the sanction of the British Government.</p>

                        <p>2—That this Department recognize a Zionist Medical Unit composed of from
                            thirty-five to forty-five persons. This Unit is to proceed to Palestine
                            to render service to the civilian population there.</p>
                        <p>I hesitate to accede to these requests in view of the following
                            considerations:</p>
                        <p>1—This Government has never accepted Mr. Balfour’s pronouncement with
                            reference to the future of Palestine<note n="74" xml:id="d77fn1">See

                            agents to that territory, in which action the British Government has
                            entirely acquiesced.</p>
                        <p>2—This Government is not at war with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>3—A possible embarrassment may arise on account of the presence in
                            Palestine of individuals, even though their errand is one of mercy,
                            sponsored by an organization having distinctly political aims.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful to you if you would advise me of your views with
                            reference to this communication from the Zionist Committee.<note n="75"

                                organization, I earnestly request you to authorize the issuance of
                                passports to E. W. Lewin-Epstein, Mary Fels, and such others as may
                                be named by my Committee, all being loyal American citizens of
                                creditable reputation, said passports to be issued to them
                                personally on their appearing before the designated official, so as
                                to enable them to proceed to Palestine, via London or Paris.
                                Together, the persons named and to be named will go as part of a
                                Commission representing our Zionist organization, joining a Mission

                                and other countries, which together will form a Mission proceeding

                                Dr. Weitzmann to Palestine. The objects of the Mission are outlined
                                in a cable, signed Weitzman Frankfurter, copy of which I

                                thirty-five to forty-five persons, in the form requested by the
                                British authorities, which I understand from representatives of the
                                British Embassy, is in accord with the precedent established by the
                                British Government in the recognition of various units that have
                                rendered service during the war for special purposes. Under the

                                nurses required for the normal purposes of any country. May I ask,
                                upon such recognition being accorded to us, the Department authorize

                            The substance of this communication has already been telegraphed you on

                            that the agreement arrived at will appear as satisfactory to you as it
                            has done to me.</p>
                        <p>Baron Sonnino has been laid up for over two weeks suffering I learn from
                            boils or carbuncles; he has, however, continued his work, which, indeed,
                            seems to have been the cause of his illness, and though no one has been
                            able to see him personally, he himself signed the Note referred to
                            above. Just what the effect of his illness would be on the Government it
                            is hard to tell. It is said in some circles that Orlando and Nitti are
                            drawing closer together; while in other circles it is said that Orlando
                            considers Nitti as a serious rival for the Premiership and knows that
                            Sonnino does not want this post, but prefers the Ministry for Foreign
                            Affairs—also that Sonnino has the confidence of the country and likewise
                            of the Allies. Furthermore, a statement which Nitti made the other day
                            in which he claims to have unearthed what is now called here the “Silk
                            Waste Scandal”, was taken by Orlando as claiming credit which the latter
                            thought belonged to him as the Minister of the Interior, under whom
                            comes all the Secret Service work relating to internal affairs. This,
                            according to the rumor, has caused some coolness on Orlando’s part
                            towards Nitti. Italian politics and political combinations, however, <pb
                                n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0157"/>change so rapidly that I would
                            not like to prophesy what the future combinations may be. It can only be
                            said with certainty that Sonnino has hitherto been the chief force for
                            carrying on the war to the bitter end that his influence has impressed
                            itself on both of the younger men—that is, Orlando and Nitti, who, I
                            believe recognize—both of them, the necessity of following this policy
                            through to the end.</p>
                        <p>Orlando is now in London having gone there from the front, where he and
                            Nitti and the Minister of War and one or two other Ministers went last
                            week to see the King, and—it is said, to learn on the ground the feeling
                            of the Army. Several reasons are assigned for Orlando’s visit to Paris
                            and London, one of which is that he has gone to make it plain to France
                            and England that Italy must be furnished more coal and more grain, and
                            that British and French troops must be left here to help withstand the
                            expected attack of Austria and her allies against this weakest link in
                            the Allied chain,—if they expect Italy to be able to hold out on the
                            Piave Line, or, indeed, at all.</p>
                        <p>There is another rumor to the effect that this visit has a further object
                            and relates Orlando’s visit to the story hinted at in the press some
                            time back about a meeting of a British high official and an Austrian
                            high official in Switzerland for purposes of discussing Austria’s making
                            a separate peace. You will know much better than I what foundation there
                            was for this rumor, and I give you the one relating to Orlando’s visit
                            simply for your information.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed by Signor Nitti that the Italian Loan subscriptions
                            have reached about six milliards of Lire. I do not know, however, what
                            form all of these subscriptions have taken. He is looking forward with
                            great interest to the expected visit of Mr. Crosby; and I myself am
                            doing the same, for I feel that anything which can be done to show the
                            Italian people that we are drawing closer to them will have a great
                            effect in strengthening their morale. The morale of the Army is, I am
                            assured, exceedingly good, but unquestionably the morale of the people
                            needs bolstering up in view of all the writing that goes on in the press
                            and all the talk that goes on outside about approaching peace
                            negotiations, as the result of the Notes and speeches which have been
                            made on this subject by leading public men on one side or the other.</p>
                        <p>If the stories about Austria’s wishing to make peace are true, she
                            appears to be going about it, so far as Italy is concerned, in a
                            somewhat curious way, unless indeed she feels she has some good reason
                            to believe that her attempt to destroy Italian cities and kill numbers
                            of the civil population will terrorize Italians into insisting on
                            stopping the war. She not only has increased immensely her attempts at
                            destruction of cities in the war zone, such as Venice, Treviso and <pb
                                n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0158"/>Padua, but has just sent a
                            dirigible or dirigibles to drop bombs on Naples, where the night before
                            last some fifteen people were killed and some forty were wounded in a
                            dirigible raid. Apparently the raid on Naples has not affected the
                            spirit of the people in the least, though in Venice, where so many of
                            the men have left and the remaining population are mainly old men, women
                            and children, the continued air raids have got on the nerves of the
                            people and arrangements have had to be made to remove them to a certain
                            extent. We had quite an alarm here just after day-break which proved to
                            be the result of the return of the dirigible from its innocent diversion
                            of killing civilians in Naples, it having taken a course which indicated
                            that it was returning by way of Rome. All the lights were extinguished
                            and street cars and other traffic were stopped, but the dirigible did
                            not come this way. The story got out that the Vatican which has its own
                            electric plant, kept its lights burning, and some color is given to the
                            report by the fact that the press this morning contains a statement that
                            the Vatican will extinguish its lights along with the rest of the city
                            should any future alarm be given.</p>
                        <p>As I forward regularly weekly reports containing a resumé of the
                            political news given in the press from day to day, I do not feel it
                            necessary to do more than send you in these letters what may be termed
                            “inside information”, or information which will throw a light on what is
                            sent in those reports.</p>
                        <p>I will say in closing, however, that I consider the situation here,
                            especially among the civil population is sufficiently serious for us to
                            avail ourselves of every occasion and means to show the people that we
                            are doing more and more all the time to aid and sustain them. They
                            certainly rely more and more on America for this, and I feel it
                            important for us to do as much as lies in our power to justify their
                            expectation.</p>

                            <p>Senate Resolution 178 was introduced in the Senate by Senator Borah
                                on January 9, 1918, and reads as follows:</p>

                                    sessions of the Senate, report to be made to the Senate at an

                            </quote>
                            <p>This resolution provides in substance for the consideration of
                                treaties by the Senate in open session. The inadvisability of
                                passing a resolution of this sort is shown by the following
                                considerations:</p>
                            <p>1. The public discussion of treaties might and in certain cases
                                certainly would wound the sensibilities of foreign governments,
                                resulting in estrangement rather than friendship which it is
                                presumed is always one of the purposes of international agreements.
                                The feelings of foreign governments must be considered because
                                subjects of discussion in international affairs do not, as a rule,
                                concern ourselves alone, but concern other countries also.
                                Confidential matters which are entrusted to us cannot properly be
                                divulged to other countries without discourtesy and offence; for we
                                have no right to insist that the secrets of one power be shared by
                                all other powers. If foreign countries knew it was the fixed
                                practice of this Government to discuss publicly all treaties before
                                senatorial consent was given they would hesitate to enter into many
                                agreements which they now negotiate with the United States in the
                                confidence that the information disclosed in the course of the
                                negotiation will not be published but will be held in confidence, a
                                condition which they have a right to impose. There is no more reason
                                why treaties should be discussed in open session than appointments
                                made by the President by and with the <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114"
                                    facs="0160"/>advice and consent of the Senate should be debated
                                there publicly The reason such appointments are approved or
                                disapproved by the Senate in secret sessions is chiefly because of
                                the sensibilities of the nominee and of the restraint publicity
                                imposes upon debate.</p>
                            <p>2. If the feelings of foreign governments were to be regarded in the
                                public discussion of treaties in the Senate, the views of individual
                                senators would not be freely exchanged. This would [in]evitably lead
                                to a curtailment of the frank discussion which now takes place in
                                secret executive session. Treaties would, therefore, be given less
                                consideration, resulting in an imperfect understanding of their
                                provisions, and possibly in more frequent rejection than would be
                                the case if the discussion was confidential.</p>
                            <p>3. The discussion of a Treaty should be distinguished from the
                                discussion of a Bill. The one relates to intercourse with foreign
                                nations, the other almost exclusively to relations between citizens
                                of the United States; or of citizens and the Government of the
                                United States. Citizens do not stand in the same relation to each
                                other as do nations. Laws are imposed by the Legislature while
                                treaties are compacts between equal parties. There is no breach of
                                confidence in the discussion of a Bill. Moreover citizens may
                                protect their interests through their representatives in the Senate,
                                whereas a foreign nation has no such means of influencing that body,
                                except by insidious propaganda—a practice to be discouraged.</p>
                            <p>4. The public discussion of treaties by the Senate would lead to the
                                injection of local politics into international affairs with
                                unfortunate results. An example of the effect of debating a treaty
                                in open session is the result of the public discussion of the
                                Bayard-Chamberlain Fisheries Treaty of 1888. That treaty, if it had
                                been ratified, would have practically ended the North Atlantic Coast
                                Fisheries controversy between the United States and Great Britain.
                                As a result of open discussion in the Senate, the treaty became
                                something of an issue in the Presidential campaign of that year and
                                failed of ratification. That the treaty did not deserve to be killed
                                by publicity is evidenced by the fact that the substance of some of
                                its most important provisions were embodied twenty-two years later
                                in the award by the permanent court at the Hague in the North
                                Atlantic Coast Fisheries Arbitration. There may, of course, be
                                exceptional cases in which it may be desirable to have public debate
                                in the Senate upon treaties, but this should be left to the
                                discretion of the Senate, and should not be made the rule. In 1912
                                the Taft arbitration treaties were debated in open session.</p>
                            <p>5. The introduction of politics into the approval of a treaty might,
                                for obvious reasons, lead to the publication of all or some of the
                                correspondence leading up to the treaty. The possible results of
                                this method would be to destroy the usefulness of the American
                                representative abroad, and confidence in him among the people at
                                home. If an American diplomat reports to the Secretary of State that
                                the foreign minister with whom he deals is attempting to barter and
                                therefore the initial demands should be exaggerated, publication of
                                this despatch would destroy the success of the negotiation and the
                                usefulness of the diplomat in the country to which he is accredited.
                                If, on the other hand, the diplomat reported that the foreign
                                minister was fair and reasonable, and that it would be better to
                                draft the <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0161"/>demands as nearly
                                as possible to meet his wishes, publication of such a despatch might
                                destroy confidence in the United States as to the diplomat’s ability
                                to represent his country. Publication of the one despatch would tend
                                to create antagonism in a foreign country, and publication of the
                                other, suspicion of disloyalty of the diplomat to the best interests
                                of his country.</p>
                            <p>The practice of publishing despatches exchanged during negotiations
                                would have an inevitable effect upon the negotiators of a treaty.
                                Their discussion would be less frank; sources of information would
                                be more guarded; the possibility of agreement less likely. There
                                would also be the tendency to encourage the writing of despatches
                                not for the person to whom they were addressed, but for the public
                                by whom they will be read. It would close the door for confidential
                                or even friendly exchange of views or ideas during the progress of
                                the negotiations. In short the end most to be desired, namely, to
                                reach an agreement, would be endangered.</p>
                            <p>6. Consideration of treaties by the Senate is really a part of the
                                negotiations; for that body then functions as an adviser of the
                                Executive. He may reject its advice or he may adopt it, continue
                                negotiations accordingly, and resubmit the result to the Senate. In
                                the latter case the whole negotiation might be nullified by public
                                discussion in Executive session for the reasons already mentioned.
                                There would, moreover, appear to be no sound reason why the Senate’s
                                part in the negotiations should be public and the rest of the
                                negotiation kept secret. For the grounds stated it seems clear that
                                the entire course of negotiations should be confidential, including
                                discussion in the Senate, until possibly after the treaty has been
                                completed.</p>
                            <p>7. There is in fact no necessity for public discussion of treaties in
                                the United States, for the reason that it is not and never has been
                                the policy in this country to make secret treaties with foreign
                                countries. This perhaps has been in a measure due to the fact that
                                the United States has been moved by the general conception that the
                                policy of fairness toward other states in the long run inures to the
                                benefit of this country in its international relations. The finished
                                treaty is always made public while the confidences exchanged in
                                negotiation are protected. But in any event there could be no secret
                                treaties in the United States since the treaty-making power does not
                                rest wholly in the President, but is shared by the Senate. The
                                history of the constitution shows that when the states gave up their
                                right to enter into treaties they insisted that through the Senate
                                they should have a voice in, and advise and consent as to any
                                convention. If the Senate should approve of any treaty inimical to
                                the interests of the United States or any State, the Senators who
                                approved such a treaty can in due course be removed by the people.
                                It is not possible, therefore, for the United States, even if it
                                were not contrary to its principles, to bind itself for any length
                                of time to a treaty which is secret, and hostile to the best
                                interests of the country. Thus the secret article annexed to the
                                treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848 failed of approval by the United
                                    States.<note n="81a" xml:id="d81fn1">For text of this treaty,

                                countries the practice of entering <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116"
                                    facs="0162"/>into secret treaties is fostered by the
                                constitutional system giving the Executive or the Crown exclusive
                                power to make and ratify treaties or at least certain classes of
                                treaties without reference to the people. For this reason Bismarck
                                stipulated in the preliminary articles of peace at the close of the
                                Franco-Prussian war that the treaty of peace should have the
                                sanction of a National Assembly of France.</p>
                            <p>Owing to the sensitiveness of foreign countries in respect to the
                                divulgence of confidential information imparted to the United States
                                during negotiations; in view of the curtailment of frank discussion
                                if the sensibilities of foreign countries are not to be wounded;
                                considering that the public discussion of a treaty is not on the
                                same plane as the debate on an Act of Congress; considering also
                                that the public debate of treaties in the Senate would lead to the
                                injection of local politics into international affairs with the
                                possible publication of the negotiations leading up to the treaties
                                to the detriment of the diplomatic service abroad and at home;
                                considering further that the “advice and consent” of the Senate to
                                treaties is really a step in the confidential negotiations preceding
                                the treaty; and finally in view of the fact that owing to the system
                                of government of the United States whereby the President and Senate
                                are responsible to the people no secret treaties are or can be
                                entered into by the United States, it would seem clearly unwise for
                                the Senate to consider in public executive session treaties
                                submitted from time to time to that body by the President so long as
                                the final result of the negotiations is not concealed from the
                                people.</p>

                            referring to the rumor being circulated in Italy that the President had
                            made some statement adverse to Italy’s hopes, I published through the
                            Stefani Agency a brief denial of the rumor. This denial has been
                            commented on very favorably in the Italian press, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Messaggero</hi> having an editorial.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tribuna</hi> points out that besides the specific
                            report denied by me there have been other false statements circulated in
                            Italy, such as that Italy’s internal conditions had been reported in the
                            United States by American commissioners in Italy as being very
                            disheartening. All of this is to a certain extent a part of the
                            defeatist propaganda <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0163"/>and for
                            the rest is due to a certain nervousness on the part of the public which
                            latter is caused, I think, in part by our concentrating in France all of
                            our troops who are sent over to this side. It has interested me very
                            much to see a certain growth here in the feeling against France, a
                            feeling which is apparently much stronger among the people than in the
                            Government. It seems to be felt that France avails herself of her
                            position and her relation to America to take for herself an
                            unconscionable part of what America as well as England and South
                            American countries can furnish to the common cause.</p>
                        <p>A memorandum recently furnished me by Signor Nitti, who is one of the
                            coolest and most level headed men in the Government here, which I sent
                            to you in my despatch No. 857 of March 19th,<note n="83" xml:id="d82fn3"
                                >Not printed.</note> reflects this feeling and states that Italy
                            would be content with one sixth of the coal that France gets if it were
                            sufficient to enable her to carry on the war; but at present she only
                            gets about one ninth.</p>
                        <p>To some extent she has the same feeling towards England and she looks to
                            America to more nearly equalize in her case the assistance extended to
                            the Allies. This is indicated by the reference to her feeling that
                            England and France could readily furnish her more than they do but will
                            not do so unless America takes steps to insist upon a juster
                            apportionment. The fact is that Italy, . . . conscious of having faced
                            extraordinary difficulties internal as well as external in this war,
                            feels herself tremendously isolated and cut off from the other Allies.
                            Her whole foreign policy for thirty years has been addressed towards the
                            Central Empires which she feels was necessary for her at the time but
                            has left her in a false position, at least according to the views of the
                            Allies, and whatever failure there may be to come to her aid is regarded
                            with a certain bitterness as being caused by this view. Nitti’s
                            memorandum alludes to the fact that Italy was left to defend alone,
                            except for recent loans of British and French troops, her Austrian
                            frontier which was nearly as long as the French frontier, defended by
                            France, England, and Portugal, and now by us. They are looking to the
                            United States as giving the most immediate promise of additional aid and
                            if it does not come I would not like to guarantee how long her present
                            enthusiasm about the United States will continue.</p>
                        <p>Her Government people have heard only this morning that Baker does not
                            think he can come to Italy and their disappointment and their feeling
                            that a great mistake has been made was so plain that, sharing fully in
                            this view as I do from my knowledge of the situation, I telegraphed
                            Baker urging him to come here without fail and have telegraphed you
                            asking you to support me in this request.</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0164"/>
                        <p>It is believed here that an attack is most imminent. Austria has massed
                            against Italy not only her armies formerly aligned against her but those
                            which have come from her eastern frontier and there is a feeling of
                            subdued but serious anxiety here as to what the effect of this attack
                            will be. The crumbling at Caporetto in the autumn gave Italy a shock
                            from which she is still suffering and I feel that it is necessary to do
                            everything possible to sustain her and keep established her resistive
                            power.</p>
                        <p>At this moment all Italy is awaiting with bated breath the result of the
                            tremendous German offensive on the British front in France, the anxiety
                            being increased by the fact that little or no news is allowed to come
                            through beyond the official communiqués which are too sybilline to give
                            much assurance. Ere this reaches you, however, the issue will have been
                            decided and so it is useless for me to take up your time in discussing
                            the situation. To me it appears that the whole matter now rests on which
                            side has the best generals. If England and France have generals who know
                            how to handle the situation and utilize the great resources at their
                            command they ought to win the war there and now.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Colonel</hi>: Mr. Auchincloss gave me your
                            invitation for luncheon on Friday next and I am sorry I cannot accept
                            it. I concluded from what he said that the purpose was to discuss the
                            American and British differences as to the League of Nations, and
                            particularly the attitude of Lloyd-George as expressed in his public
                            address about a month ago.</p>
                        <p>As you probably know Mr. Page wrote a long letter to the President on the
                            subject. He sent a similar one to me,<note n="84" xml:id="d83fn1">Not
                                found in Department files.</note> which I found very interesting in
                            its dissection of British opinion.</p>
                        <p>To be entirely frank I am not disposed to quarrel too severely with the
                            Prime Minister’s opinion in regard to the League to Enforce Peace,
                            because I am not at all sure he is not in a measure justified. The
                            movement has been for several years very industriously and, I may say,
                            very ably advocated in this country; but, doubting its efficiency as a
                            means to insure international peace, I have, as you know, never
                            affirmatively given it my personal support.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>The practical element, in my opinion, in any league of nations is the
                            good faith of the members. If they are untrustworthy, an agreement to
                            unite in the forcible maintenance of peace would be worthless. If this
                            is the true view, the character of the membership of the league should
                            be of first consideration, and I do not understand this to be in the
                            scheme of Mr. Taft and others advocating a League to Enforce Peace.</p>
                        <p>Briefly let me recall to you my line of thought, which I discussed with
                            you a year and a quarter ago: No people on earth desire war,
                            particularly an aggressive war. If the people can exercise their will,
                            they will remain at peace. If a nation possesses democratic
                            institutions, the popular will will be exercised. Consequently, if the
                            principle of democracy prevails in a nation, it can be counted upon to
                            preserve peace and oppose war.</p>
                        <p>Applying these truths (if they are truths and I think they are), I have
                            reached the conclusion that the only certain guarantor of international
                            peace is a League of Democracies since they alone possess the
                            trustworthy character which makes their word inviolate. A League, on the
                            other hand which numbers among its members autocratic governments,
                            possesses the elements of personal ambition, of intrigue and discord,
                            which are the seeds of future wars.</p>
                        <p>A League, composed of both democratic and autocratic governments and
                            pledged to maintain peace by force, would be unreliable; but a League,
                            composed solely of democracies, would by reason of the character of its
                            membership be an efficient surety of peace.</p>
                        <p>To my mind it comes down to this, that the acceptance of the principle of
                            democracy by all the chief powers of the world and the maintenance of
                            genuine democratic governments would result in permanent peace. If this
                            view is correct, then the effort should be to make democracy universal.
                            With that accomplished I do not care a rap whether there is a treaty to
                            preserve peace or not. I am willing to rely on the pacific spirit of
                            democracies to accomplish the desirable relation between nations, and I
                            do not believe that any League relying upon force or the menace of force
                            can accomplish that purpose, at least for any length of time.</p>
                        <p>Until Autocracy is entirely discredited and Democracy becomes not only
                            the dominant but the practically universal principle in the political
                            systems of the world, I fear a League of Nations, particularly one
                            purposing to employ force, would not function.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the proper course, the one which will really count in
                            the end, is to exert all our efforts toward the establishment of the
                            democratic principle in every country of sufficient power to be a menace
                            to world peace in the event it should be in the hands of <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0166"/>ambitious rulers instead of the people.
                            Unless we can accomplish this this war will, in my opinion, have been
                            fought in vain.</p>
                        <p>We must crush Prussianism so completely that it can never rise again, and
                            we must end Autocracy in every other nation as well. A compromise with
                            this principle of government, and an attempt to form a League of Nations
                            with autocratic governments as members will lack permanency. Let us
                            uproot the whole miserable system and have done with it.</p>
                        <p>In reading over this letter it impresses me as a little too oratorical,
                            but I am sure you will pardon that in view of the strong convictions
                            which I have on the subject. I simply cannot think with complacency of
                            temporizing or compromising with the ruffians who brought on this
                            horror, because to do so will get us nowhere, and some future generation
                            will have to complete the work which we left unfinished.</p>

                            letter of <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0167"/>May 19 last, in
                            respect to a similar measure then before you for approval. It would seem
                            to me highly important that nothing should be done to obstruct the
                            exercise of governmental powers in obtaining information in the interest
                            of national safety and defense.</p>
                        <p>As, however, the matter of investigation and collection of such
                            information is largely under the immediate direction of the Attorney
                            General I shall, of course, defer to his judgment in this matter.</p>
                        <p>With very warm regards [etc.]</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I spent nearly two
                            hours this afternoon with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in
                            regard to the King resolution for a declaration of a state of war with
                            Turkey and Bulgaria. From what Senator Hitchcock had told me and from
                            the impression I gained in the first few minutes of the conference today
                            I found that all of the Republicans and many of the Democrats on the
                            Committee were predisposed to reporting favorably the King
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>In view of the situation I thought it best to state that the question was
                            one of expediency, that I was not present to advise but to consult with
                            the Committee as to the wisdom of a declaration such as the one
                            proposed. I made it clear that neither you nor I sought to influence
                            improperly Congressional action, that the responsibility for the
                            declaration of a state of war lay with Congress and they could not avoid
                            the responsibility, and that the Executive branch of the Government
                            could go no further than lay the facts before them and give opinions
                            when asked. This attitude seemed to make the supporters of the
                            resolution very cautious.</p>
                        <p>The Committee asked me whether it was considered expedient by the
                            British, French and Italian Governments for us to declare a state of war
                            with these two allies of Germany. I told them that I did not know but
                            that I was willing to inquire if they wished me to do so.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized the fact that the whole problem was one of policy based upon
                            the proposition of winning the war, that I was not there to advocate a
                            particular course of action but to elucidate to the Committee the
                            situation as far as I was able, and that it was only a question of
                            whether a declaration of war would be more helpful or more injurious to
                            our cause.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this conference with the Committee it was arranged that I
                            should obtain the views of the Allied Governments as to the advisability
                            of a declaration by us of a state of war with Turkey <pb n="122"
                                xml:id="pg_122" facs="0168"/>and Bulgaria together, or with Bulgaria
                            alone. Until this information is obtained there will be no action.</p>
                        <p>In view of the very evident majority in the Committee favoring a
                            declaration against both Turkey and Bulgaria I suggest the sending of
                            the enclosed telegrams to London, Paris, and Rome, and to the War
                            Council at Versailles.<note n="86" xml:id="d86fn1">For the telegrams as

                            wishes in the matter?</p>
                        <p>I have agreed to confer again with the Committee when I know more
                            definitely the views of our cobelligerents, expressing the opinion that
                            it would take at least ten days to obtain these views.</p>

                            propaganda and influence in Italy,—the other a Memorandum of a Secret or
                            quasi-Secret Convention signed on the 21st of April, “Rome’s Natal Day”,
                            between the Italian Government and a certain Colonel Stefanik,
                            representing the Czech-Slav Council, as it is called.</p>
                        <p>This paper will, I think, interest you as may the observations which I
                            have made on it to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>I am also sending with a covering despatch, a document typewritten in
                                French<note n="88" xml:id="d87fn2">Neither printed.</note>
                            containing what I suppose may be termed the aspirations of Montenegro,
                            which I am really sending for you, as I think it will also interest you.
                            It was handed me yesterday by the King of Montenegro himself as I was
                            leaving him after a call on him in return for a call which he had made
                            on me the afternoon before. He arrived here two or three days since on a
                            visit to his daughter the Queen, which is the first visit which he has
                            made to Italy, as when he passed through here on his way to France on
                            the collapse of Montenegro he did not leave the special train on which
                            he travelled from Brindisi through Italy, although the train remained in
                            Rome over night. He was visited at the station both in the evening and
                            early morning by the Queen, and, as I recall it, by the King also—I
                            think the King was in Rome at that time—but the King of Montenegro did
                            not leave the <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0169"/>Station. It was
                            said at the time that this was to prevent political complications of one
                            kind or another, but gossip also had it that the numerous guards which
                            guarded the train that night served another purpose also.</p>
                        <p>On the present occasion, however, the King is paying a visit to the Queen
                            of Italy at the Villa Savoia, and he left his cards on both the British
                            Ambassador and myself. I suppose also on some of the other Ambassadors.
                            On my return visit to him I found him to be a strong, vigorous,
                            clear-headed, and, I think, shrewd old gentleman, with his mind very
                            definitely set on aiding Montenegro. He brought up the subject of the
                            charge laid against him of a deal with Austria, and denied it with great
                            earnestness, crossing himself by way of an oath to affirm his innocence
                            of any such idea. He declared that his hope and the hope of his people
                            is in America, the champion of Liberty and of Democracy. He asked me to
                            do all in my power to commend his country and people to this great
                            American champion of free peoples, and he used the phrase that his
                            country threw itself into the arms of America. I said in reply that our
                            people and you who represent them have great sympathy and appreciation
                            with and of all free peoples, and that it would give me pleasure to
                            repeat his conversation to you, but that, of course, all such matters as
                            those to which he adverted rest with our Government at home and its
                            chosen representative, and it would be manifestly out of my province to
                            make any declaration touching matters which rested with you. It was just
                            as I was leaving, that he picked up the paper which related to
                            Montenegro’s aspirations which I am sending and asked me to send it to
                            you. This I am doing for your information, as I feel sure you will find
                            it interesting. I asked him about his stay in France, saying that I
                            supposed he had found it very pleasant and he replied: “Oh, yes, it is
                            very pleasant there and the French have been very kind to me.”—I think
                            he rather indicated that he was referring to the past rather than to the
                            present, for, he added “There are too many Servians about me, and the
                            Servians do not like me. They hate my country and want to absorb
                            it.”</p>
                        <p>I give you the foregoing items because I think they throw a certain light
                            on his present situation. It is said here that his arrangements made in
                            secret with Austria have placed him under suspicion of nearly all the
                            Allied Powers and I have heard the criticism made that he got a great
                            deal of money from the British and French, who have rather resented
                            this. Perhaps he remembers that wise saying of Solomon that the rich
                            have many friends.</p>
                        <p>My own idea is that he is, as I have said, a vigorous and shrewd old
                            Statesman who knows the full value of the cards in his hand <pb n="124"
                                xml:id="pg_124" facs="0170"/>and intends to use them to win his
                            game, if it be possible, and I believe that what he has in mind is to
                            save his people and his House, and, if possible, to better their
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>By-the-by he informed me that he is sending a Minister to Washington whom
                            he spoke of as one of the first men in Montenegro and he mentioned with
                            satisfaction that he had been a General. He evidently desired to impress
                            me with the fact that this Minister is a man on whom he greatly
                            relies.</p>
                        <p>Having said so much, I can only repeat in closing that Balkan Politics
                            are too muddy for me to know what lies underneath.</p>
                        <p>My telegrams have given as full information as to the situation here at
                            present as I possess, so I will not go into this at present, except to
                            say that the gossip about the rivalries of Nitti and other Members of
                            the Cabinet who are in control continues. Orlando has just returned from
                            the meeting of the Premiers in France. He and Sonnino appear to have
                            drawn somewhat closer together of late, possibly in view of what is said
                            to be Nitti’s ambition, to become the ruling Member of the Cabinet.
                            Orlando knows that Sonnino has no ambition to take his place and Sonnino
                            knows that Orlando does not want his, but both are said to feel that
                            Nitti is their rival and would take either place. This Nitti denies. He
                            said to me—evidently referring to this report—that he could not and
                            would not under present conditions leave the Treasury Ministry. It is
                            even said by Nitti’s enemies that he is trying to make terms with both
                            the Clericals and the Socialists. This seems to have some foundation,
                            and I should not be surprised to see him making all the friends he can,
                            but I feel very sure that his idea is rather to lead them in the defense
                            of Italy through the prosecution of the war to a just peace than to
                            yield to any views which they might have contrary to this end.</p>

                            opinion of the Supreme War Council that we should declare war against
                            Turkey but not at present against Bulgaria. From the fact that it is
                            signed by Sackville-West I assume that it represents in substance the
                            views of the British Government. As you have also seen the Italian
                            Government <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0171"/>favors a declaration
                            against both, and I have been unofficially advised that the French
                            Government holds the same view. I think that we may assume, therefore,
                            that all the Entente Powers favor a declaration against Turkey, but that
                            Great Britain thinks that it would be wise to delay action against
                            Bulgaria and that is also Bliss’ opinion.</p>
                        <p>In considering these replies I think that we should observe the failure
                            to recognize the humanitarian side of the question. Thousands of
                            Armenians and Syrians are being kept alive today by the distribution of
                            supplies purchased through funds sent to our missionaries in Turkey,
                            which amount to one or two millions of dollars a month. If a state of
                            war is declared that relief will come to an end, our missionaries will
                            be expelled or interned and the great missionary properties will be
                            confiscated. I am not arguing the undesirability of a declaration but
                            only pointing out the consequences which appear to have been ignored,
                            possibly through ignorance, by the Supreme War Council and the
                            Governments which have given their opinion. Their point of view seems to
                            have been entirely military and their opinion based practically on the
                            encouragement of resistance by the Georgians, Caucasians and others to
                            the Turkish advance in the Caucasus and upper Euphrates. Whether that is
                            sufficient aid in winning the war must be decided.</p>
                        <p>In any event the time has arrived when a definite policy for or against a
                            declaration against the Turks must be formulated as the Senate Committee
                            will expect guidance in regard to the resolution before them.
                            Furthermore I think nothing can be gained now by delay in reaching a
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>In regard to our attitude toward Bulgaria Great Britain seems disposed to
                            have us postpone action until we have seen the effect upon that country
                            of a declaration against Turkey. I see the possible strategic advantage
                            to be gained by such a course, but I am not at all sure that the
                            Committee will, and I am not at all sure that British diplomacy is now
                            more adroit than it has been previously in dealing with the Balkan
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>It has been my impression that the chief advantage to be gained by
                            declaring war against the two Governments which we are considering was
                            the effect that a declaration against Bulgaria would have upon the
                            Greeks and Serbs; and that the peculiar reason for a declaration against
                            Turkey was that war against a Christian nation without war against a
                            Moslem nation would cause general criticism in this country and possibly
                            could not be prevented in view of the temper of the Senate. Undoubtedly
                            the presence of the Bulgarian Minister in this capital has been one of
                            the principal reasons for the present agitation, and I do not think that
                            we can ignore it.</p>
                        <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0172"/>
                        <p>I think that I should add that an argument against any declaration has
                            undoubtedly weighed with some of the Committee in that neither Turkey
                            nor Bulgaria have committed acts of war against this country since the
                            declaration against Austria-Hungary. In view of this fact, what
                            plausible reasons could be urged for a change of policy at the present
                            time? In this connection would not it be said with reason by Germany
                            that we had not declared war against Turkey or Bulgaria because we hoped
                            to separate them from the Central Powers and that having failed in our
                            diplomacy we had abandoned the effort and purposed to coerce them? This
                            might possibly encourage the Germans and subject us to their
                            ridicule.</p>
                        <p>As I expect any day to be asked to appear again before the Senate
                            Committee and tell them of the views of the other Governments and of the
                            War Council, I would like to be advised what I shall say to them.</p>
                        <p>The following courses seem open:<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>No declaration against either country on the ground that we
                                    could not declare war against Bulgaria without declaring against
                                    Turkey, and that to declare against Turkey would be to remove
                                    the protection and relief which we have furnished to thousands
                                    of refugees in Turkey.</item>

                                <item>A declaration against Turkey alone, on the ground that it
                                    would encourage the resistance in the regions of the Caucasus,
                                    and would constitute a threat to Bulgaria which would bring her
                                    to terms.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>A declaration against Turkey and a severance of diplomatic
                                    relations with Bulgaria which would emphasize the threat as to
                                    the future.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>A declaration against both Turkey and Bulgaria on the ground
                                    that every nation which is an ally of Germany should be classed
                                    as a foe.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do not include as an alternative a declaration against Bulgaria alone
                            because I think that the Committee would be radically opposed to that
                            action.</p>
                        <p>If you would be good enough to indicate the attitude which you think that
                            I should take with the Committee I would be greatly obliged.</p>

                            Clemenceau has compelled the Emperor and Government of Austria-Hungary
                            to take a position in regard to Germany which makes further peace
                            approaches to them well-nigh impossible, while their attitude toward
                            Italy will be, as a result, generous in order to influence the latter
                            country to withdraw from the war, and so release Austrian troops for the
                            front in Flanders.</p>
                        <p>Like all these questions arising at the present time I think that they
                            should be considered always from the standpoint of winning the war. I do
                            not believe that we should hesitate in changing a policy in the event
                            that a change will contribute to our success provided it is not
                            dishonorable or immoral.</p>
                        <p>In the present case it seems to me that the pertinent questions are the following:<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Is there anything to be gained by giving support to the

                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Is there any peculiar advantage in encouraging the

                                <item>In brief, should we or should we not favor the disintegration
                                    of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into its component parts and a
                                    union of these parts, or certain of them, based upon
                                    self-determination?</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the time has come when these questions should be
                            answered.</p>
                        <p>If we are to check the effect of the possible bribe of territory which
                            will doubtless be offered to Italy, is not the most efficacious way to
                            offset this inducement to declare that the aspirations of the subject
                            nations of Austria-Hungary should be determined by the people of those
                            nations and not by the power which has compelled their submission? Italy
                            in such circumstances will undoubtedly consider the possibility of
                            obtaining far greater concessions than Austria-Hungary can offer. She
                            will therefore remain true to the common cause. Furthermore the
                            revolutionary spirit of the nationalities concerned would be given a new
                            hope. Unquestionably a revolution or its possibility in the Empire would
                            be advantageous. Ought we or ought we not to encourage the movement by
                            giving recognition to the nationalities which seek independence?</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0174"/>
                        <p>I have no doubt that you have been, as I have, importuned by
                            representatives of these nationalities to give support to their efforts
                            to arouse their fellow-countrymen to opposition to the present Austrian
                            Government. This importunity is increasing. What should be said to these
                            people? Some answer must be made. Should we aid or discourage them?</p>
                        <p>I do not think in considering this subject we should ignore the fact that
                            the German Government has been eminently successful in the
                            disorganization of Russia by appealing to the national jealousies and
                            aspirations of the several peoples under the Czar’s sovereignty. Whether
                            we like the method or not, the resulting impotency of Russia presents a
                            strong argument in favor of employing as far as possible the same
                            methods in relation to Austria’s alien provinces. I do not think that it
                            would be wise to ignore the lesson to be learned from Germany’s policy
                            toward the Russian people.</p>
                        <p>I would be gratified, Mr. President, to have your judgment as to whether
                            we should continue to favor the integrity of Austria or should declare
                            that we will give support to the self-determination of the nationalities
                            concerned. I think that the time has come to decide definitely what
                            policy we should pursue.</p>

                            inquiry as to the advisability of declaring war on Turkey and
                            Bulgaria.</p>
                        <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0175"/>
                        <p>This makes the situation as follows: The British, French and Italian
                            Governments agree in advocating a state of war with both countries,
                            while the Supreme War Council favors war against Turkey at once and
                            probably war against Bulgaria later in the event of the latter not being
                            affected by a declaration against Turkey.</p>
                        <p>From the political point of view the Council’s advice seems to me unwise.
                            As to the united opinion of the Allied Governments I think careful
                            consideration should be given. I feel, however, that a decision cannot
                            be much longer delayed.</p>

                            indicates that Italy is very willing to weaken Austria by exciting the
                            Czecho-Slovaks with the hope of independence or at least of
                            self-determination, but is unwilling to encourage the Jugo-Slavs because
                            of their relations with the Serbs whose ambitions and claims over-lap
                            those of Italy along the Adriatic.</p>
                        <p>The claim that the Serbs and Jugo-Slavs will fall under Austrian
                            influence seems to me a very flimsy argument put forward to disguise the
                            real motive of the Italian objection to giving encouragement to the
                            political aspirations of the Jugo-Slavs. It is all after a piece with
                            the selfish policy which wrecked the Balkan situation early in the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>Should we, or should we not, listen to Italy, knowing her motive, and
                            give no encouragement to the Slavs of the south? Will the possible
                            dissensions aroused in the Austrian Empire by awaking in those peoples
                            the hope of an autonomous nationality be worth while even though it may
                            not be in accord with the ambitious expectations of Italy as to the
                            eastern shores of the Adriatic?</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the Jugo-Slavs are a sufficiently defined nationality
                            to be entitled to self-determination and to have their desire
                            recognized, unless policy prevents.</p>
                        <p>It all comes down to the expediency of listening to Italy or of
                            recognizing the justness of the Jugo-Slav desire for nationality
                            disregarding the extreme claims of Italy to territory now occupied by
                            Jugo-Slavs.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0176"/>
                        <p>From the standpoint of principle I think that the Jugo-Slavs and Serbs
                            are entitled to support, but from the standpoint of winning the war a
                            decision is more difficult. Nevertheless I feel that a decision should
                            be speedily reached, because, if the suppressed nationalities of
                            Austria-Hungary are to be aroused, now seems to be the time.</p>

                            <p>Whereas, the President of the United States in his address to the
                                Congress of the United States on January 8, 1918 said: “An
                                independent Polish State should be erected which should include the
                                territories inhabited by the indisputably Polish populations, which
                                should be assured a free and secure access to the sea;”</p>
                            <p>And, Whereas, on the fifth day of June, 1918, at the session of the
                                supreme war council at Versailles the British, French, and Italian
                                representatives agreed that: “The creation of an independent Polish
                                state, with free access to the sea, constitutes one of the
                                conditions of a solid and just peace and of the rule of right in
                                Europe.”</p>
                            <p>Be it therefore Resolved by the House of Representatives, that the
                                House of Representatives consider the creation of a free and
                                independent Polish state, with access to the sea, to be one of the
                                objects for which the United States is fighting in the present war,
                                and as one of the necessary provisions in any treaty of peace which
                                may be concluded.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: At a time when a stage
                            has been reached in the progress of this great war which marks it as
                            probably the most critical since the early September days of 1914, when
                            Paris all but fell into the grasp of the German armies, I have thought
                            that a survey of the situation as it exists at this moment might be
                            appreciated by you. Reports which deal exclusively and in detail with
                            the military situation must be so readily available to your Department
                            that I shall confine myself almost entirely to the political aspects of
                            conditions to be found here.</p>
                        <p>Like former ones to you, I have chosen to have this letter partake of a
                            personal nature rather than that of a more official despatch because of
                            its confidential character on account of the use of certain names, as
                            well as quotations from those prominent in public affairs. Such a letter
                            also gives me more freedom than I would feel permitted to employ in
                            telegrams to the Department, regardless of the kind of cipher used.</p>
                        <p>We are now passing through the third stage of the war, well-defined and
                            quite distinctive from the preceding ones.</p>
                        <p>The first stage, in its shortness of duration as well as in the
                            pyrotechnic display of its force, was as some brilliant meteor flashing
                            across the skies from the borderlands of the Belgian frontier and dying
                            out almost in the very environs of Paris. Like a flash, the flower of
                            Germany’s troops swept over what should have been the inviolate
                            territory of Belgium, meeting its first check by the heroic defenders of
                            Liège.</p>
                        <p>I shall always believe that the forced delay of but a few days, before
                            the forts of that doomed city were crumbled by the shells of the great
                            German guns, was, nevertheless, sufficient to enable the Allied forces
                            to oppose the oncoming horde of invaders with the matchless defenders of
                            the Marne.</p>
                        <p>This first stage of the war, so spectacular in its course, was ended
                            within six weeks after the declaration of hostilities. Both contending
                            forces, given a momentary respite, then burrowed themselves underground
                            along a line extending from the English Channel to the Swiss frontier,
                            and a unique warfare began such as has never in its fullest sense
                            characterized any other war of history. This was the trench system of
                            warfare.</p>
                        <p>The strongest of man-made forts could be crumbled like powder by the
                            giant shells of modern artillery, but they made little depressions like
                            so many dents on the surface of Mother Earth which, in <pb n="132"
                                xml:id="pg_132" facs="0178"/>some places,—particularly in the
                            territory of the famous campaign of Arras—were so numerous as to
                            resemble, when I first saw them, a myriad of miniature valleys among the
                            choppy billows of an ocean. Amidst such scenes one wondered how even a
                            mole could escape alive. But the trenches were deep and whole armies
                            lived within their cavernous protection.</p>
                        <p>For nearly four years this second stage—pre-eminently the trench stage—of
                            the war ran its course, as we know, until late in the month of last
                            March, with only here and there any material advance, the exception
                            being the marked retreat of Von Hindenburg’s army just a year before in
                            the section extending from Noyon in the south to Arras in the north.
                            This very method of warfare, characterized by the impregnability of the
                            trenches, and the constant watchfulness of the “man up in the air” to
                            prevent any surprise massing of troops on either side, made such
                            conditions fixed and unchanging.</p>
                        <p>These two stages, however,—the first of but a few weeks’ duration, the
                            second of nearly as many years—have become a matter of history.</p>
                        <p>The third stage—more important than the preceding ones, because I believe
                            it to be destined to be the final stage of actual warfare—was ushered in
                            by the German attack late in March as abovementioned. It is this stage
                            and the aspects surrounding its advent, in so far as the Paris view is
                            concerned, that just now naturally most seriously engaged the attention
                            of the Allied Powers.</p>
                        <p>All recognize that the attacks now being made constitute Germany’s
                            supreme effort to win the war;—the “hurry-up” program of her military
                            chieftains, to strike a mortal blow at the French and English armies
                            before those from America can intervene to save the situation. The
                            universal question as to whether they will be able to carry out such
                            purpose, and, if so, of course to end the war, was asked with the
                            greatest concern at the end of the first ten days of the marked gains
                            made by the enemy along the British front.</p>
                        <p>The final checking of that advance was reassuring only in a limited
                            measure. Everybody naturally expected the second attack, but,
                            unfortunately, not in the place where it was finally launched. Again
                            confidence was shaken in the ability of the Allied forces to withstand
                            these onslaughts for again, as in the preceding attack, a considerable
                            slice of territory including what must be conceded as an enormous booty
                            in supplies, munitions, guns and prisoners of war, fell into the hands
                            of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>But as the wearing away of the surface of a body that has been constantly
                            more and more compressed becomes more difficult and more retarded in its
                            process, so the mass of the defenders of the important passes leading
                            toward Paris, becoming more compact, <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133"
                                facs="0179"/>was finally able to resist any further advances—nay,
                            more than this, to recover in some places the ground already lost and to
                            inflict upon the enemy what is now quite fully admitted by him to have
                            been an enormous punishment in loss of men.</p>
                        <p>Having “gotten their hand in”, so to speak, the troops under General Foch
                            have been able, only recently, to hold the enemy in his third successive
                            attack, even though in superior numbers, at a standstill. It is in the
                            last two attacks—particularly in the second one on the sector between
                            Rheims and Soissons—that the American troops first signalled the mighty
                            power upon which, almost in the twinkling of an eye, the weary and
                            discouraged soldiers of the English and French divisions, fighting so
                            desperately all these trying years, have come now to rely so implicitly
                            for deliverance.</p>
                        <p>The effect upon the people has been magical. To-day America’s stock is
                            quoted in the streets of every hamlet, village and town of France at a
                            highwater mark. Everywhere the American soldier is looked upon somewhat
                            as the big policeman who interposes to protect the passerby against the
                            sudden attack of the murderous thug. Perhaps, excepting that of courage,
                            if I were to signalize the one predominating characteristic—which, after
                            all, is rather generic in its scope—of our American boys in action, it
                            would be that of resourcefulness. It is indeed that one quality which,
                            in my opinion, has been more disconcerting to the enemy than any other
                            one thing, and if I may be pardoned for my conceit—I would rather call
                            it pride—in their achievements, I would say that the German troops are
                            hereafter going to give these boys as wide a berth as possible.</p>
                        <p>I am only confirmed in the opinion which I expressed in one of my weekly
                            telegraphic reports, that somewhere down the line, before these series
                            of German attacks have ended, the American troops will play a most
                            important rôle in saving a situation which, without them, would surely
                            mean a hopeless defeat. Ere this letter reaches you such an opportunity
                            may present itself, though I would rather believe that the next attack
                            will be directed against the English forces at a point where not many of
                            our American boys are stationed, and probably with such suddenness as to
                            preclude their effective participation for some days.</p>
                        <p>But, interesting as are these speculations, I set out to write more of
                            political than military matters.</p>
                        <p>While the above résumé has dealt quite entirely with an account of the
                            military operations, yet, out of certain conditions imposed by them, the
                            status of political affairs now existing in France may be said in a
                            measure to have had their origin.</p>
                        <p>Anything like an account, however cursory, of the doings of preceding
                            Ministries would be out of place in these busy times when <pb n="134"
                                xml:id="pg_134" facs="0180"/>we all have enough to do in dealing
                            only with the problems of the moment—or even in reading of them. As I
                            think I told you in a former letter, since my stay here of a little less
                            than four years, I have seen five ministerial changes, all of them, with
                            the possible exception of the present one, dictated in a large degree by
                            personal considerations—for jealousy, I am persuaded, can be found more
                            fully developed in the public life of France than anywhere else in the
                            world, notwithstanding her thousand and one most admirable
                            qualities.</p>
                        <p>While having a personal regard for every member of those Ministries,
                            particularly the Premiers and Ministers for Foreign Affairs,—for they
                            have all been and are to-day my good friends—yet I believe that
                            Clemenceau, despite some of his alleged shortcomings—for if must be
                            remembered that he is a man approaching seventy-seven years of age and
                            has received as many blows as he has ever given—is the one man in the
                            public life of France best qualified to meet the present critical
                            situation where the issue, many believe, must be decided on the
                            battlefield. Personally, I do not share that belief. Courage in dealing
                            with one’s friends as well as in facing the enemy is demanded; in
                            addition to this, great energy, determination and singleness of purpose
                            must be qualities possessed by the man who would dominate the situation
                            presented in France to-day. If I know the man—and I have had occasion to
                            talk with him rather frequently and study his temperamental “make-up”—I
                            believe Clemenceau possesses all these qualities.</p>
                        <p>However, while they give him strength with the people, the usual
                            concomitants of resentment and bitter feeling have not failed to
                            manifest themselves toward him from former powerful leaders in the
                            French Government. Our own well-known saying at home, that “politics
                            makes strange bed-fellows” is well exemplified in French politics, for
                            conservative men who have no socialistic tendencies find a common cause
                            of grievance against the Premier with out-and-out Radical Socialists. He
                            is a veritable “<hi rend="italic">bête-noire</hi>” in everything
                            political, to this latter class.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the influence, quite occult in its bearing, of Mr. Caillaux,
                            and the circumstances growing out of his long incarceration, I make no
                            comment. That it seems to have a mysterious power and reaches out in the
                            most unexpected ramifications is a fact with which the future may have
                            to seriously concern itself.</p>
                        <p>It is not strange that under such circumstances the Socialists who have
                            had no representatives in the present, nor in the preceding Ministry
                            have at different times sought by their interpellations as to the
                            conduct of the war to weaken Clemenceau’s Ministry; nor that whispered
                                <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0181"/>rumors have gained currency
                            from time to time of some unexpected coalition of forces that would
                            restore Mr. Briand to power.</p>
                        <p>I know that I may repeat to you in confidence what came to me recently
                            from a very distinguished Frenchman of high military rank and very
                            popular here. He said that President Poincaré had recently deplored the
                            fact that they no longer had a Government in France. The Premier’s
                            enemies quite unite in the charge that he is arbitrary, dictatorial and
                            at times whimsical. Undoubtedly he has strong likes and dislikes, and
                            such a man almost always incurs bitter enmities as well as draws to him
                            the loyal affection of others. The picture of Clemenceau is to-day a
                            composite picture of the French Government. His chief element of
                            strength lies in the confidence and trust which the army places in him,
                            and it is upon the army that France looks for her protection.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, interesting stories have been in circulation of late
                            growing out of the possible consequences of a necessary evacuation of
                            Paris. The fear has been expressed that should the Government again
                            leave the city, as it did in September of 1914, there would be a
                            crystallization of the Socialists’ element, the backbone of whose
                            strength consists in the adherence to its principles of the working
                            classes, and which might undertake to make overtures of peace with the
                            enemy—even a revolution might be inaugurated, if necessary, to carry out
                            such purpose.</p>
                        <p>But it is my opinion that only some dire calamity—some disheartening
                            defeat at the front resulting in the loss of Paris—would make the
                            position of Mr. Clemenceau insecure. With the enemy in tremendous force
                            but forty miles away, the masses of the people will not look with favor
                            upon the weakening or discrediting of a leader who, by his conduct, has
                            symbolized the national resistance to such an invader. And the
                            politicians dare not do so.</p>
                        <p>Paradoxical and strange as it may seem, the counsel of President Wilson,
                            and his constructive measures, exert a vastly greater influence upon
                            shaping the thought of the socialistic mind in France—sometimes of an
                            iconoclastic tendency—than do any other leaders of the Allied Powers.
                            The reason, perhaps, is not far to seek; it has confidence in his
                            motives. In my judgment, that influence has been a valuable asset, and
                            far more powerful in restraining the radical actions of this particular
                            group, than is generally understood. They have time and again reiterated
                            their own principles as being in full accord with those enunciated by
                            President Wilson, and I would not be at all surprised that coming events
                            would so shape themselves as to give such an unusual situation great
                            weight in harmonizing the discordant elements which will have to be
                            dealt with in making the terms of peace.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>While in its broadest application of party names, there is an actual
                            majority in the present Parliament of France—elected before the war—of
                            Socialists, yet probably out of the total number, approximating six
                            hundred, there are not more than 110 or 120 that belong to the
                            out-and-out radical variety. The moderate Socialists include men of
                            marked ability and high standing.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the only danger—and I have never believed it to be
                            great—to wise and safe action, even under adverse conditions, will come
                            from the small group of Radical Socialists. I do not here use the word
                            “Radical” as a party designation but more in its descriptive sense as
                            applied to their views.</p>
                        <p>While I have expressed the opinion that only under certain conditions
                            which I have named could the Clemenceau Ministry fall, yet I must make
                            the statement with the reservation that as in the instances of one or
                            two Ministries in the past, plans apparently deeply laid have very
                            quickly brought about their fall. Some men in high places have expressed
                            the belief that this was due to happen again. Some unexpected incident
                            may cause such a result.</p>
                        <p>If I have allowed my observations to center around Mr. Clemenceau, it is
                            not alone because of his official position,—for he is both Premier and
                            Minister of War—but because he typifies the martial spirit of the French
                            people.</p>
                        <p>I would say something, in my concluding sentences, of the attitude
                            exhibited in this crucial moment by the great mass of the people
                            themselves. If anything like fear or panic finds place in their minds,
                            it would be very difficult to discover it. I sometimes find myself
                            wondering what new phase of danger or depredation could seriously
                            disturb the outward calmness of these people. I must chiefly attribute
                            it to the fact that they have had nearly four years of war and have come
                            to accept as a matter of course any kind of conditions that might be
                            imposed by it. And yet, naturally enough, everybody is intensely
                            concerned over the events now taking place; very few fail to recognize
                            their gravity. Many have indeed quietly left the city as a precaution
                            against any dangers that may come from the expected bombardment.</p>
                        <p>Last evening I was returning at an early hour from a dinner at the Hotel
                            de Crillon, and, strolling along with some friends by the Place de la
                            Madeleine and the Boulevard Haussmann, it was remarked amongst the
                            members of the party how almost completely deserted were the streets.
                            Not for a distance of eight or ten blocks could be seen a half dozen
                            vehicles or that many people walking along. The crowds that promenade
                            the Champs Elysées at the most frequented hours have also been greatly
                            thinned out, and I should say <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0183"
                            />that in all probability one-half of the people of Paris has left the
                            city during the past month.</p>
                        <p>I dislike to express my views as to what would happen in the possible
                            contingency of Paris being eventually taken by the Germans. I have two
                            good reasons for not doing so; first, because I have never believed that
                            they could take the city, and, second, because if they did it would be a
                            matter for the commanding officers of the Allied Armies to consider. If
                            Paris in the gay times of peace was the center jewel in the crown of
                            France, it is certainly, in times of war, her heart. For that and all
                            other reasons which such a loss would involve, I hope that it may be the
                            decree of Providence that no such question will have to be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>Stranger things have happened than that to the American boys from across
                            the seas may yet come the lasting glory of saving not only Paris but,
                            with it, the Allied cause, for if the enemy cannot take Paris he cannot
                            win the war.</p>

                        <p>I am not at all sure but that this has been fortunate though inadvertent
                            because by acting independently we avoid the declaration being subjected
                            to objection and suggested amendment induced by the jealousies and
                            differences of European politics which would result in prolonged
                            discussions. The Allies are constantly seeking to have us act jointly
                            with them in political matters, and this is another effort in that
                            direction. I believe that to keep our hands free and to act
                            independently is our best policy, since we can in that way avoid taking
                            sides in the conflict of interests.</p>
                        <p>Will you be good enough to tell me if I have rightly interpreted your
                            wishes in this regard?</p>

                                if its only members at the outset were the nations now associated in
                                war against Germany? The neutral nations of Europe would in all
                                likelihood not dare to enter such a Society now in such company for
                                fear of becoming involved in the present conflict since some of them
                                lie almost at the mercy of Germany. [”]</p>

                            each step increasingly difficult. I think it would be wiser then to

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Governments of
                            France, Italy and Great Britain, as you have seen by the reports, have
                            given recognition to the Czechs as a sovereign nation or at least to the
                            Czech National Council, in terms which are assumed to be a full
                            recognition. Doubtless this was induced by our public expression of
                            sympathy with the national aspirations of the oppressed races.</p>
                        <p>In view of this action by the Allied Governments I think that we ought to
                            consider whether it is expedient to make a further declaration giving
                            more complete definition to our attitude in order to encourage the
                            Czecho-Slovaks in their struggle against the Central Powers.</p>
                        <p>Although I feel strongly that Austria-Hungary as an Empire should
                            disappear since it is the keystone of Mittel-Europa, I do not think that
                            it would be wise to give full recognition to the Czecho-Slovaks as a
                            sovereign nation. Without discussing the legal objections a serious
                            embarrassment would be the effect on the Jugo-Slavs, who would
                            undoubtedly clamor for similar recognition and feel offended <pb n="140"
                                xml:id="pg_140" facs="0186"/>if it was not granted. In any event I
                            think the declaration would have to contain a reservation as to
                            territorial limits, which would materially weaken it.</p>
                        <p>Two other courses seem open in case it is deemed to be advisable to make
                            any declaration at this time:</p>
                        <p>First. We might recognize the belligerency of the Czecho-Slovak
                            revolutionists in view of their military organization operating in
                            Siberia and Eastern Russia against Austrian loyalists and their German
                            allies. I think that it would be proper in such case to recognize the

                            expedient. Basing this action on the state of belligerency the
                            Jugo-Slavs would have no similar ground to claims recognition. As you
                            know the jealousy of Italy and the desire of Serbia to absorb the
                            Jugo-Slavs rather than to become federated with them makes it necessary
                            to be cautious in deciding on a policy.</p>
                        <p>Second. It may be wise, in order to avoid any future charge of deception
                            or secretiveness, to adopt a more general policy by issuing a frank
                            declaration that the utter subservience of Austria-Hungary to Germany,
                            whether the result of coercion, fear or inclination, forfeits whatever
                            right the Dual Monarchy had to be treated as an independent state; that
                            the nationalities aspiring to be free from Austro-Hungarian rule are
                            still more entitled to be saved from German domination; that such
                            nationalities should receive not only the sympathy but the material aid
                            of all nations who realize the evil ambitions of Germany’s rulers; and
                            that this Government is prepared to advance the cause of national
                            freedom by assuming relations with any council or body of men truly
                            representative of revolutionists against the Austro-Hungarian
                            Government, who seek national independence by force of arms.</p>
                        <p>Such a declaration would avoid the question of defined territory and of
                            naming any particular nationality, though the latter would later have to
                            be done when a military organization was in actual operation.</p>
                        <p>If this course should be adopted, it would give Austria-Hungary notice
                            that at the peace table we would oppose the continuance of the Empire in
                            its present form and within its present boundaries. To that extent it
                            would limit our freedom of action; but, if you have definitely decided
                            that that should be the policy, its declaration can do little harm since
                            Austria-Hungary is and will continue to be a tool of Germany.</p>
                        <p>It would cause a profound impression and would deeply affect the
                            nationalities involved; it would put heart into the patriots now
                            attempting to organize revolutions in the Empire; and it would be a <pb
                                n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0187"/>notification to the world that
                            this Government intends to support and give substantial aid to all
                            little nations which have been held in subjection against their will by
                            the exercise of superior force.</p>
                        <p>I submit the foregoing as a proper subject for discussion at this
                            time.</p>

                            it is time that we took definitive action in this important matter, and
                            my inclination would be to take the second course you outline; but I am
                            restrained by considerations which I shall take pleasure in explaining
                            to you orally at our next interview. They are rather too complex for a
                            brief memorandum like this.</p>
                        <p>The first alternative you suggest is, it seems to me, the one we should
                            now accept. It to a certain extent carries with it by implication the
                            principle of the second, but is as far as we need go at this time.</p>
                        <p>I would be very much obliged if you would prepare and let me see the

                            we have taken to make arrangements for the purchase of supplies in this
                            country by the Allies on the same terms with our own government and with
                            our civil population. I am sorry to say that the English government has
                            not been equally generous, or perhaps I should say equally successful,
                            in arranging that supplies that this government purchases in England
                            should be purchased upon the same terms upon which sales are made to the
                            British government and to the civilian population of Great Britain. I
                            would be very much obliged to you if you would convey a very earnest
                            intimation to the British government of our hope and expectation that
                            this reciprocal arrangement should be made as promptly and completely as
                            possible. The discriminations I have heard of have disturbed me a good
                            deal, and while I am sure that the men at the top of the government over
                            there would <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0188"/>be willing to make
                            a cordial response to such representations, I am equally sure that the
                            traders with whom they are consulting are not equally willing. You will
                            know how to give emphasis with courtesy.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Lord Reading has cabled
                            the British Embassy that there is a strong movement to bring about the
                            increase of the price paid by the British Government to the British
                            farmer for wheat, and that he had pointed out, at a meeting of the War
                            Cabinet, that the British Government should not take any action in this
                            matter until the views of the United States Government had been
                            obtained. His reason for giving this advice was that he had written you
                            a letter, at the time the bill fixing the price of wheat in this country
                            at $2.50 a bushel was pending in Congress, pointing out that such an
                            increase in the price of wheat in the United States would bear very
                            heavily on the Allies and that you had expressed yourself very strongly
                            to Congress in the matter, stating that this country should not profit
                            in the emergency by the Allies’ need.</p>
                        <p>Lord Reading stated at the War Cabinet that, in view of your generous
                            action at that time, he did not wish the British Government to increase
                            the price paid the British farmer for wheat without asking this
                            Government for its views.</p>
                        <p>The British Embassy consulted Mr. Hoover and he, informally, stated that
                            he felt that as wheat is costing Great Britain $2.39 per bushel,
                            delivered at New York, plus ocean transportation, that a rise of twenty
                            or thirty cents a bushel on the price now current in Great Britain would
                            not cause us embarrassment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hoover’s views were cabled to Lord Reading who answered that he
                            desired the views of the United States Government as expressed through
                            the State Department.</p>
                        <p>My first answer to the British Embassy was that I regarded this matter as
                            purely an internal question and one concerning which this Government
                            would not express any opinion. I have further considered the matter with
                            particular reference to the fact that Lord Reading feels that having
                            urged upon you the desirability from the Allies’ standpoint of not
                            advancing the price of wheat in this country, action by the British
                            Government advancing the price of wheat to its farmers to cover the
                            increased cost of production, would be most ungracious, unless an
                            intimation was received from the United States Government that such
                            action would not embarrass it.</p>
                        <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>I should appreciate authority from you to advise the British Embassy,
                            informally, that I had submitted the matter to you and that, while you
                            did not wish in any way to be quoted, you did not feel that the proposed
                            action of the British Government would embarrass this Government.</p>
                        <p>I am told by the British Embassy that this matter is rather urgent.</p>

                            yesterday I prepared for your consideration the enclosed draft of a
                            public declaration in regard to the Czecho-Slovaks.<note n="2"

                        <p>I find there is a disposition among the newspapermen to discuss—possibly
                            to criticize—our silence in regard to this matter. I have been fortunate
                            enough to be able to stop it thus far but to tell the truth it is
                            getting out of hand. I hope therefore that we can do something very
                            shortly.</p>

                            from General Pershing surprises me very much. It is the first time he
                            has undertaken to give advice, political as well as military, in this
                            way.</p>
                        <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0190"/>
                        <p>I am clear that it would be out of the question for me to urge, without
                            the (at least intimated) concurrence of the Supreme Military Council,
                            such action in all the military theatres of the war; and it is equally
                            clear to me that events, not any suggestions from us, will determine the
                            action of Bulgaria and Turkey. You know the advances that have been made
                            to us from Bulgaria and Turkey and how imprudent and unwise it would be
                            for us to use the only channels that are open!</p>
                        <p>Baker, as you know, is now on the water, on his way to the other side,
                            and Pershing will have an opportunity to confer with him about the whole
                            matter. Baker special commission is to have every question about the
                            actual conduct of the war and its effective pressure to an early
                            conclusion that can be answered now, and with the utmost possible
                            definiteness.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In reference to your
                            letter of August 29th, which I enclose as a reminder of its
                                contents,<note n="5" xml:id="d108fn1">
                                <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_411">p.
                                411</ref>.</note> I have inquired as to the situation relative to
                            British Government prices being denied our Government in England.</p>
                        <p>I am informed by representatives of the War Trade Board that Mr. Baruch
                            says that the matter has been satisfactorily adjusted as a result of
                            conferences which representatives of the War Industries Board, now in
                            London, have had with British officials; and he also suggests that the
                            matter be allowed to rest for the present.</p>
                        <p>In going over the matter I find the problem is much more complicated than
                            appears on the face, and that the attitude which we should definitely
                            take has not been determined. The British colonies, for example, are
                            desirous of making large purchases in this country and it is a question
                            to what extent we should give them the benefit of our governmental
                            prices since, in many cases, it is almost impossible to determine
                            whether their purchases are for military purposes or for civilian
                            purposes. I believe it is generally agreed that the Associated
                            Governments should give one another the benefit of governmental prices
                            where the goods purchased are required for the conduct of military
                            operations. This seems to be the theory, but in practice the line of
                            demarcation between purchases for military purposes and purchases for
                            commercial purposes is difficult to draw. This is particularly true in
                            cases where the governments themselves are so largely purchasing for
                            their domestic requirements and subsequently allocating their purchases
                            among their nationals.</p>

                            <p>France and Italy remain, as always, the main theatres of the war. A
                                decisive victory can only be gained by the Allies by the decisive
                                defeat of the German Army, and its defeat would necessarily entail
                                the total collapse of enemy resistance on the remainder of the
                                Western front and in all other theatres of war.</p>
                            <p>The Allies must, therefore, concentrate their resources both in man
                                power and in material on the Western front for the decisive
                                struggle.</p>
                            <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0193"/>
                            <p>The decisive defeat of the enemy coalition can only be achieved on
                                the portion of the Western front between the North Sea and
                                Switzerland. And, even though it might appear possible to crush the
                                Austrian Army on the Italian front, and a portion of the German Army
                                with it, the final defeat of Germany, the real foundation of the
                                hostile coalition, can only be brought about in the theatre of
                                operations where the main German Armies are to be found, that is to
                                say, between the North Sea and Switzerland.</p>
                            <p>Operations in the other theatres of war must be made to play their
                                part in the decision sought for on the Western front by contributing
                                to the moral and material exhaustion of the enemy. But such
                                operations must not be allowed to absorb resources which are
                                required by the Armies of the Entente on the decisive front. The
                                defeat of the Central Powers in any of the subsidiary theatres of
                                war could only be a step on the road to the defeat of Germany: it
                                could not bring about the final decision.</p>

                                superiority which will be appreciable. But if, in spite of the
                                reverses he has met with during the Summer and Autumn of 1918, the
                                enemy’s fighting power still remains unbroken, it will only be in
                                the Spring of 1919 that the Allied superiority in men, in tanks, in
                                aeroplanes and in other material of war will justify the expectation
                                of a great success, which would be capable of being exploited to the

                                front secure against any hostile attack and, secondly, must make
                                preparations, which are complete in all respects, for those
                                offensive operations by which it is hoped to reach a final decision
                                as soon as a sufficient superiority has been realised, and climatic
                                conditions permit.</p>
                            <p>The Allied Front can only be made secure by a solid, vigorous and
                                active attitude of defence, which must include such local offensives

                            <p>Finally, it is necessary to think out beforehand all such operations

                                It will be the duty of the Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the Allied
                                Armies in France to determine the scope of such preparatory

                            <p>Similar preparations should be made for the Italian front. If the

                                diplomacy by military action, offensive operations in Italy might be

                            <p>In order to facilitate a concentration of troops in Italy not only
                                for offensive operations, as indicated above; but also in order to
                                deal effectively with a possible attack by the Austro-Hungarian
                                Army, reinforced for that purpose by a number of German Divisions,
                                it is essential for the Allies to push forward as rapidly as
                                possible such improvements to communications as will enable a
                                sufficient force to be transferred from France to Italy before a
                                hostile attack can achieve success.</p>

                                        Armies, have lost much of their importance in consequence of
                                        the new lines of communication available for the Turkish
                                        Army to the Caucasus and Mesopotamia by the Black Sea, thus

                            <p>Under these conditions it is neither possible nor opportune to fix
                                distant objectives. But, operations of limited scope should be
                                carried out in order to hold and attract enemy forces.</p>
                            <p>Operations of this nature would not justify a large numerical
                                superiority of the British over the Turkish Armies. The possibility,
                                therefore, of withdrawing troops during the winter should be
                                considered in order to reinforce the Armies on other fronts.</p>

                            <p>The British Army in Mesopotamia is very greatly superior in numbers
                                to the Turkish troops actually opposed to it, or which are likely to
                                be opposed to it. It might appear possible, therefore, to operate
                                both in Mesopotamia and in Persia; but lack of communications and
                                means of transport would probably prevent this. Consequently, the
                                Commander-in-Chief in Mesopotamia with the troops now at his
                                disposal should spare no effort which would enable his forces to
                                establish themselves firmly on the shores of the Caspian Sea and to
                                render secure the Baghdad-Hamadan-Enzeli road.</p>
                            <p>A secure front, which included Baghdad and the Caspian Sea, would
                                limit German activities in the East and would enable the Allies to
                                stretch out a hand to such forces as could eventually penetrate into
                                Russia from Vladivostock and the Arctic Ports. With the Allies
                                established firmly on such a front, not only will the Germans be
                                unable to supply themselves from the rich resources of Turkestan, on
                                which they could otherwise draw by means of the Caspian Sea and the
                                railways leading East and West from it; but all the healthy elements
                                which still exist in Russia, as well as the anti-turc and Armenian
                                elements in the Caucasus, would be encouraged to crystallise into
                                effective fighting bodies, which would absorb considerable enemy
                                forces and so relieve pressure on the Western front.</p>
                            <p>The Commander-in-Chief should be free to advance to Mosul if it
                                should appear to be advantageous to do so, provided that the
                                necessary operations did not entail any diminution of the effort
                                towards the Caspian Sea.</p>

                            <p>Having weighed the considerations which should govern the conduct of
                                the operations in the various theatres of war, the Military
                                Representatives are of opinion that the investigations into the
                                various Allied manufacturing programmes should be followed up by
                                determining without delay the relative proportion of raw materials,
                                of labour and tonnage which should be allotted to each kind of
                                manufacture according to its importance for the prosecution of the
                                war.</p>
                            <p>The manufacturing resources of the Allies appear already to be
                                extended to their utmost capacity. It is, therefore, essential in
                                order to obtain the best returns that the available resources be
                                distributed strictly in accordance with the military requirements of
                                the operations to be undertaken. And this distribution must be made
                                in accordance with the views expressed by the Commanders-in-Chief in
                                the various theatres of operations as to the relative amount of
                                manufactured products they would like to receive in the form of
                                guns, aeroplanes, heavy tanks, light tanks, gas, railway material,
                                etc.</p>
                            <p>The Military Representatives wish in conclusion to draw the attention
                                of the Supreme War, Council to the very great importance of ensuring
                                that as early as possible the Allied Armies shall be made to reach
                                their maximum strength, not only in man-power, but also in material.
                                The Military Representatives consider that the culminating points in
                                the development of mechanical contrivances of all kinds should
                                coincide with the culminating point in the development of
                                man-power.</p>
                            <p>If this coincidence of culminating points is attained, the Allies may
                                look forward with all confidence to the operations of the year 1919,
                                which will bring the fulfilment of their hopes, that is to say,
                                peace through victory.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have just returned
                            from an interesting, and from the point of reinvigoration, very
                            successful visit to France and England. On other accounts also I esteem
                            my visit to have been profitable, if not successful, for I was able to
                            see both Mr. Baker and General Pershing and impress on them the absolute
                            need of not disappointing Italy in her expectation of having American
                            troops sent here. Indeed, to see General Pershing and get this necessity
                            lodged in his mind was the main object of my visit to France.</p>
                        <p>I can not say that I consider my mission there to have attained complete
                            success or, for the present, any success at all. In fact I made it clear
                            to General Pershing that I was not asking that he should send any troops
                            whatsoever from France at this time who would by possibility be
                            available in the present offensive, but I addressed my efforts to
                            securing his assent to sending them later on when the offensive, and any
                            immediate consequences it may have, shall be finished.</p>
                        <p>I was appalled to find not only the ignorance of matters Italian, but the
                            indifference to all such matters as I found among those with whom I came
                            in contact in France. I do not say this of General Pershing or of his
                            Chief of Staff, for they struck me as being open minded, but the
                            majority of those to whom I mentioned the importance of supporting Italy
                            in what is really a very serious moment not only for her, but for the
                            Allies, “pooh-poohed” Italy as wholly negligible, and more than one met
                            my assertion of Italy’s need with the argument that it was held by some
                            well informed military personages that the Allied cause would be
                            stronger without Italy than with her. In other words, that Italy’s
                            balance with the Allies was one of burden and not one of assistance.
                            They appeared to stand blindly on the military aphorism that a general
                            should not divide his forces, which I take to apply to tactics rather
                            than to strategy. I cited to them, in response to this, the signal
                            example of Napoleon’s having divided his forces and conquered Europe
                            through Austria; and the further examples of Lee having divided his
                            forces again and again and won substantial victories over his
                            adversaries; and of Grant having divided his forces and sent Sherman
                            across the south while he held Lee in his trenches from Cold Harbor to
                            Petersburg.</p>
                        <p>Irrespective of the foregoing, however, I must say that at this moment
                            Italy is holding her own defensively with firmness, and the <pb n="155"
                                xml:id="pg_155" facs="0201"/>spirit of her people up to the present
                            is as high as it ever was. But this I attribute, to an important extent,
                            to her confidence in the United States. The San Mihiel victory has given
                            her new spirit but if, during the late autumn and early winter, the
                            United States does not send troops to Italy, this feeling is liable to
                            evaporate and she will feel that she has been abandoned by the great
                            power to which she has trusted.</p>
                        <p>Her efficient forces are far less numerous than they are generally
                            supposed to be. Colonel Buckey has made a careful study of this matter
                            and has sent me a statement of her resources in man power based on
                            official figures and verified by him to the best of his ability. From
                            this it appears that Italy has only 1,589,000 combatants actually
                            serviceable at this moment. I enclose a copy of Buckey’s statement on
                            this subject which is complete.<note n="6" xml:id="d111fn1">Not
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Add to such inferiority in numbers her want of articles of absolute
                            necessity such as coal, steel, gasoline, and other crude materials, and
                            the condition of poverty in which her people find themselves, as
                            compared with the condition of the people of France and England, and you
                            can see what a field exists here for pacifist propaganda, socialistic or
                            other.</p>
                        <p>The peril of this situation is recognized not only by the Italians
                            themselves from the very highest down, but by every American who comes
                            here with an open mind and sees the situation for himself. I can not
                            tell you how many men of the most serious character have told me what
                            their apprehensions are should America leave Italy unassisted with
                            soldiers this autumn. But they range from the chief of state down,
                            however veiled their method may be of giving this information.</p>
                        <p>The need, indeed, of supporting Italy with American troops is much
                            greater from other standpoints than from the military. The feeling
                            between the people of Italy and the people of France is one of at least
                            acute rivalry, and Italy, that is the Italian people, feel profoundly
                            that France is now growing fat on America while Italy grows poorer and
                            poorer.</p>
                        <p>The sudden lowering and control of Italian exchange will, I trust, in
                            time have a good effect, but the immediate consequence is that the
                            Italian currency buys less than it did before the exchange fell because
                            the prices are maintained at the old figures.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing, my dear Mr. Secretary, is but a small part of what I could
                            say on this most important question. I will add only another hint on the
                            political situation.</p>

                        <p>Our people have saved France and England. They can, I believe, save Italy
                            and then they may rest contented with having saved the world.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I cannot help but feel
                            that we stand in a peculiar relation to the civilian population in the
                            regions of France and Belgium occupied by the Germans. As we are
                            fighting on their soil and as our own people and territory are, in a
                            measure by that fact, spared the horrors of a German invasion, it seems
                            to me that we should view the situation very much as if our own land had
                            been occupied and our own people subjected to the privations and brutal
                            treatment which for four years have been the portion of the Belgians and
                            French.</p>
                        <p>We are receiving constant reports, the truth of which seems beyond
                            question, that the retiring armies of Germany are destroying property
                            and committing outrages in the territory which they are forced to
                            evacuate, that the destruction is without any military benefit
                            whatsoever, and that this deliberate lawlessness is inspired by malice
                            and spite.</p>
                        <p>If these criminal acts were perpetrated against American citizens on
                            American soil, I believe that we would be warranted in attempting to
                            prevent it by threatening reprisals upon the territory and property of
                            the Germans and by declaring that full reparation would be required for
                            all property destroyed or carried away, which in no way contributed to
                            the military advantage of the retreating armies.</p>
                        <p>If this view is correct and I think that it is, our peculiar relationship
                            to the French and Belgians, arising from the fact that our battlefields
                            are on their territory and their non-combatants are suffering from
                            German vindictiveness caused by the successes of our arms, raises the
                            question whether it is not our right, if not our duty, to threaten
                            reprisals unless this wanton destruction and ill-treatment by the
                            retreating Germans cease.</p>
                        <p>We have been for some time, as you know, pressed to do this by the French
                            and Belgian Governments, but up to now I have not had time to consider
                            the subject except from their standpoint. I do it now from our
                            standpoint, and would appreciate your determination as to our course of
                            action.</p>

                            require action.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Allied Governments may consider the time is
                            opportune to negotiate with Bulgaria a definitive treaty of peace in
                            order to forestall a possibly too generous treatment when the final
                            peace is made. I believe that Serbia and Greece would favor a settlement
                            of the Balkan Question now while Bulgaria is helpless, and that Roumania
                            would not be loath to such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>As we are not at war with Bulgaria, the Allies may take the position that
                            a separate peace treaty with her is not our affair and that they can
                            conclude it independently going as far as they please in drawing the
                            boundaries of the Balkan States. If they do this there will be the
                            future embarrassment of revising such a conqueror’s peace. It will be
                            hard to do it. And if it is harsh and unjust (as is very possible), it
                            will not make for permanent peace.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances ought we not to consider the advisability of
                            intervening with the Powers and of insisting that as the Balkan Question
                            must be included in the final settlement, all questions relating to
                            territory in those regions should be, by agreement in the separate peace
                            treaty, postponed for consideration to the general peace conference?</p>
                        <p>I am very fearful that now that Bulgaria is powerless the old political
                            game in the Balkans will be renewed, and that the same pernicious
                            jealousies, which prevented the kingdom from remaining neutral, if not
                            friendly, will start the victors to quarreling again. If this can be
                            prevented it ought to be because the consequences might be very
                            serious.</p>
                        <p>We could act on the Bulgarian appeal to you for mediation, or we could
                            act on the principle that no treaty relating to territory should be
                            recognized if negotiated during the war but should be treated as the
                            Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest Treaties will be treated.</p>
                        <p>If anything is to be done to anticipate an undesirable treaty with
                            Bulgaria by the Allies, it will have to be done quickly, I think, if it
                            is to be effective. It would be difficult to face a <hi rend="italic"

                            Minister, this morning, went through the rather farcical business of
                            presenting the communication which we had read and handed to him last
                                night.<note n="7" xml:id="d114fn1">

                            at Salonika, so he said that he could see no object in making reply to
                            the note.</p>
                        <p>The Minister seemed to be actually rejoiced at the surrender of his
                            country. He said that when the change of ministry took place some weeks
                            ago he was convinced Bulgaria would withdraw from the war because the
                            new cabinet was anti-German. I told him in response to his inquiry, that
                            I did not know the terms of the armistice but assumed that they would be
                            demobilization of the Bulgarian armies, control of the railroads, and
                            surrender of all occupied territory.</p>

                        <p>He further said that he was convinced that the capitulation was forced by
                            the people and very likely by the army.</p>

                            that is more likely to be a seed-bed of war than the Balkans. Peace with
                            Bulgaria cannot be treated apart from the general Balkan settlement
                            without embarrassing the consideration of such matters as the reopening
                            of the treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest and making many matters

                        <p>The Ambassador informed me that he had received a telegram from the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs advising him that the French Government <pb
                                n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0205"/>considered it unwise to discuss
                            terms of peace with Bulgaria, that the difficult settlement of the
                            Balkan Question should be postponed until the general peace conference,
                            and that the present armistice should be continued in force to that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>He said that the terms of the armistice were evacuation of occupied
                            Serbian and Greek territory by the Bulgarians, disarmament of the
                            Bulgarian army, surrender of important strategic positions in Bulgaria
                            to the Allies, and the use and control of Bulgarian Railways. I have an
                            impression that he said that the Bulgarians were also to deliver over to
                            the Allies all war supplies in their possession.</p>

                                found in Department files.</note> and my recent letter to you on the
                            subject I am now advised that of the 50,000 civilian population of St.
                            Quentin none were found on the entry of the French troops, while the
                            Germans had given the city over to destruction by fire. Of course the
                            removal of the citizens and the setting fire to the city on evacuation
                            were acts without military benefit and appear to have been inspired by
                            malice and vandalism.</p>
                        <p>Possibly nothing we could say would have any effect in checking this

                            think we may presume, are retained for forced labor or to gratify a
                            desire to cause needless suffering. However, it might stay these
                            ruffians if we made a general statement that if those atrocities
                            continued it would be necessary to hold those responsible liable
                            therefor and that it would be impossible to restrain our troops from
                            excesses of a like nature in the event that German cities and villages
                            should fall into the hands of our forces.</p>
                        <p>I am not sure that this is the best way to deal with this subject, but it
                            is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the troops, who have seen the
                            results of this needless cruelty, will be so enraged and bitter that
                            they will retaliate in kind if the opportunity offers which now seems
                            probable. This would be to my mind deplorable as <pb n="160"
                                xml:id="pg_160" facs="0206"/>it would bring them down to the level
                            of German brutality and I feel that, as we may expect such acts of
                            revenge if the Germans do not cease their present methods, we should
                            warn them of the consequences by some general statement which will
                            present the possibilities to them.</p>

                            by withdrawal from all occupied territory, by denouncement of the
                            treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest, and by a declaration that these
                            acts will be performed regardless of the course pursued by Germany—that
                            is on the basis of a separate peace.</p>

                        <p>I appreciate very deeply your kind words about my work here. They came at
                            the psychological moment, because I was just recovering from an attack
                            of the grippe, in some one of its Protean forms, <pb n="161"
                                xml:id="pg_161" facs="0207"/>which has literally cursed Europe
                            during this year. I suppose it finds its natural pabulum among these
                            under-nourished and under-warmed populations. It leaves one for a time
                            somewhat depressed and not inclined to take the most cheerful view of
                            things. Naturally, your appreciative words have had a very bracing and
                            tonic effect.</p>
                        <p>I enclose you herewith some documents that may be of interest to you. You
                            know of the persistent efforts made by our European associates in this
                            war to get the United States to formally approve and commit itself to a
                            policy of action in Russia which is counter to the one which the United
                            States Government has adopted for itself and which was very clearly and
                            solemnly declared to the ambassadors of Great Britain, France and Italy
                            in your Note of (I think) July 22nd [<hi rend="italic">17th</hi>]
                                last.<note n="14" xml:id="d119fn3">

                            seem to think that there cannot be such a thing as a conscientious
                            policy in such matters; they are inclined to altogether divorce
                            conscience and policy.</p>
                        <p>That Note plainly declared the policy of the United States, and at the
                            same time, said that the United States Government did not assume to
                            criticise or to interpose objections to such other policy as the
                            European Allies, in their wisdom, might choose to adopt. In accordance
                            with its declared policy, the United States informed the European Allies
                            on September 27th [<hi rend="italic">26th</hi>] that it would send no
                            more troops to North Russia.<note n="15" xml:id="d119fn4">See <ref
                                    target="frus1918Russiav02#pg_546">
                                    <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 546</ref>.</note> The reason
                            for this I assume, is (among other things) because it was evident that
                            these American troops were intended to be used in a form of military
                            intervention to which the United States Government would not commit
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, and only a few days after your declaration of September
                            27th, Mr. Clemenceau directed the French Military Representative on the
                            Supreme War Council to bring this subject again before the Military
                            Representatives. The French Military Representative did this in the form
                            of the drafts of two proposed Joint Notes, to be passed by the Military
                            Representatives and to be presented by them to the Supreme War Council
                            (which includes, of course, the President of the United States). I
                            enclose herewith, in the original French, a copy of each of these
                                drafts.<note n="16" xml:id="d119fn5">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of these proposed Joint Notes sets forth a plan of general military
                            intervention in Russia, quite counter to the declared policy of the
                            United States. It also assigns to the United States a specific share in
                            this intervention. If submitted to the President and approved by him, it
                            would require him to reverse the action taken in the declaration of
                            September 27th (about sending additional American troops to Archangel)
                            and also to formally approve a <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0208"
                            />line of policy counter to that which he had already declared to be the
                            policy of the United States in Russia.</p>
                        <p>The second of these Joint Notes related specifically to the sending of
                            American reinforcements to Archangel.</p>
                        <p>Manifestly, as I have understood my instructions on this subject and the
                            general attitude of the United States toward it, I could not sign either
                            of these Notes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of War, Mr. Baker, happened to be here, on the very day of
                            his departure for the United States. I formulated my views in a letter
                            addressed to him, stating the general attitude which I proposed to take
                            provided he believed it correct.</p>
                        <p>The Military Representatives met to consider these subjects on the
                            morning of October 7th. I was unable to be present in person, on account
                            of my illness, and I therefore submitted my views in the paper,
                            herewith, dated October 6th, and marked “A”.<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d119fn6">Not printed.</note> I thought that this paper made
                            perfectly clear the fact that I could not sign the Joint Notes because
                            that involved a request for the President of the United States to
                            formally approve a policy counter to his own declared one, and because
                            the sending of further American troops involved their employment in the
                            execution of such a policy.</p>
                        <p>For some reason, which you may guess (I can only attempt to guess it,
                            myself), the French Military Representative then requested whether I
                            would not sign the note relating to the general policy of intervention
                            in Russia, provided he omitted the clauses in which specific reference
                            was made to participation by the United States. This is in line with the
                            manifest determination to get the President to approve the policy of the
                            European Allies in Russia, even though he should not participate in the
                            execution of such a policy. Of course I could not be a party to putting
                            such a request up to the President of the United States. I therefore
                            submitted to the Military Representatives a second statement dated
                            October 7th (herewith, marked “B”).<note n="17" xml:id="d119fn7">Not
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The European Allies know quite well that they have no occasion to ask the
                            President to approve their policy in Mesopotamia, or Palestine, or
                            Macedonia. Why do they insist on his approving it in Russia? I suspect
                            that it is because they feel that effective intervention in Russia, on
                            the scale which they contemplate, can only be carried out by the
                            resources,—men, material and money—of the United States.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I am sending you a copy
                            of a letter which I have written Colonel House and which I hope will
                            bring him to Italy before he gets his impressions too strongly deepened
                            in an atmosphere which just at present is about as little in sympathy
                            with Italy as can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>I would be glad to have the President see this letter. I mean to keep
                            Colonel House very fully informed of what goes on here, and there is
                            such seething just now that the sentiment may change almost from day to
                            day. Those with whom I come in contact are beginning to feel very
                            strongly that Italy should make an offensive and I should not be
                            surprised if General Diaz has to do so or give place to some one
                            else,—Should his military judgment, which I incline to think sincere, be
                            as strong as McClellan’s was when before Richmond and deter him from
                            taking an offensive himself.</p>
                        <p>The dash that Italy is making in Albania at present is intended to
                            off-set the inaction of General Diaz on the Piave front, but public
                            opinion here seems to be focusing on an offensive as soon as the Piave,
                            which is now in flood, falls sufficiently to admit of possible success.
                            People say that Diaz has won his laurels in his successful defeat of the
                            enemy on the Piave when he drove him back across the river and is afraid
                            to risk what he honestly believes will be a defeat. It is possible that
                            there is something in this view. There is also another strong influence
                            against an offensive: That of those who say that the Allies are winning
                            already and Italy has lost so much that she should not sacrifice more
                            from any political motive while the Allies are doing so well. I know
                            that some of the ecclesiastics are taking this view, and one can never
                            tell how strong the views of the Church may be with any particular
                            person here in Italy. Diaz is considered to be sustained by Signor
                            Nitti, who is more or less responsible for him.</p>
                        <p>It may, however, all be over long before this letter reaches you, and we
                            may be on the road to peace. If we are, please say to the President that
                            I know who won this war and made the road to peace. I do not venture to
                            say what I think about it all, but it’s enough.</p>
                        <p>With cordial regards [etc.]</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Colonel House</hi>: I am enclosing in a
                                letter to Frazier<note n="19" xml:id="d120fn1">A. H. Frazier,
                                    counselor of embassy at Paris.</note> a personal letter inviting
                                you and Mrs. House on behalf of Mrs. Page and myself to come and be
                                our guests at the Embassy while you are in Rome. We can arrange also
                                for any members of your personal entourage, one or two with us and
                                others at an hotel nearby.</p>
                            <p>I am sending now, as you know, to Paris copies of all telegrams sent
                                by me relating to the situation here in Italy so that you may have
                                such information before you as I send to America. Information,
                                however, in letters and telegrams falls very far short of that which
                                one gets from being in the atmosphere himself, and no where does
                                that which we attempt to describe by that word indicate so truly the
                                realities of things as here in Italy. There is, in fact, no way in
                                which you could obtain a true comprehension of what Italy is and
                                stands for, and will probably stand for in the future, without
                                coming here where you will be able to meet and talk with and test
                                for yourself the men who not only represent Italy at present but
                                will very likely represent her in the negotiations which may take
                                place before a great while and in the period following the
                                conclusion of peace.</p>
                            <p>I deem it, therefore, of great importance, on this and on many other
                                accounts besides this, that you should come here and see and feel
                                for yourself the whole complex combination of sentiments, principles
                                and purposes which together make up the Italy which you will have to
                                deal with when the time comes for adjusting matters so as to [<hi
                                    rend="italic">sic</hi>] a just and durable peace. It is not a
                                hard journey from Paris, everything will be made easy for you and I
                                can assure you of a very sincere welcome on the part not only of
                                ourselves at the Embassy but on the part of the Italian Government.
                                I have had two conversations with Baron Sonnino, and he informs me
                                that he has telegraphed Washington and also Paris and intends to
                                telegraph to England—or possibly has already done so—urging you to
                                come to Italy this time. And I will say come before you get your
                                impressions of Italy out of the French atmosphere. I suggest this
                                not only because Italy has felt very neglected in the past, and
                                there is always danger that such a feeling may deepen into an idea
                                that she is intentionally slighted, but because she has been
                                neglected and she does feel isolated and the consequences should she
                                think herself slighted would not cease with the close of this war,
                                but would continue and might have a disastrous effect hereafter on
                                our relations. The other reason why I am particularly urgent in this
                                matter is that there is a strong feeling <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165"
                                    facs="0211"/>here in Italy that France is cutting her off from
                                America for her own purposes and prevents her getting in touch with
                                those in America who if they came to know Italy really would
                                understand her and have a very different apprehension of what she
                                represents than at present exists among Americans. There is a strong
                                feeling in Italy anyhow against France and this has unquestionably
                                deepened in these last months, and it is no uncommon thing to hear
                                this feeling expressed in terms which represent real antagonism and
                                may, in the future, represent hostility sufficient to injure the
                                smooth working of what the President has in mind. The rivalry
                                between the Italian and the French forces on the other side of the
                                Adriatic, and the race which they are making to get possession each
                                before the other of towns and regions, is only an expression of the
                                feeling I mention, and the failure of Italy to place her army and
                                her fleet under the command of the French Commander in Chief and of
                                the French Admiral, commanding in the Mediterranean, is to some
                                extent also an expression of the same feeling. Nor is this feeling
                                confined to Italy and the Italians. It exists in an equal degree and
                                possibly in an even more exasperating form among the French toward
                                the Italians, and there is danger of the feeling becoming so general
                                that our enemies may be able to take advantage of it, if not at the
                                council table, which is also a possibility,—at least as soon as the
                                war is over.</p>
                            <p>There is in Italy a certain element composed of very diverse classes
                                which is perhaps more friendly even now to the Central Empires than
                                to France, and they are ready to avail themselves of every
                                opportunity to testify their preference. Italy says—I use this term
                                as representing not only the element above referred to but Italians
                                generally—that France is “squeezing” her and, lying across the
                                highways to England and America, absorbs substantially everything
                                that she can and allows Italy to have only what leaks through. And
                                she says further that not content with this, France is now
                                endeavoring to seize all she can to the east of her and cut her off
                                from any development in that direction.</p>
                            <p>You see there are many men in public life here in Italy that are
                                familiar with the whole progress of France’s relation to Italy from
                                the demand by her of Nice and Savoy down to the seizure of Tunisia
                                in the early eighties after France had threatened to bombard Genoa
                                should Italy take Tunisia. The Triple Alliance was the direct
                                outcome of this last move on the part of France, and Italy’s whole
                                foreign policy—speaking in general terms—for the last thirty or
                                thirty-five years has been directed with special reference to the
                                Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. The questions touching the
                                Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean are those which lie at the
                                very foundation of the war. Now, no one can understand the <pb
                                    n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0212"/>questions touching the
                                Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean without coming to Italy. He
                                may not do so even then, but without coming it is impossible. One
                                might as soon, or sooner, indeed, understand the Negro question in
                                America without going to the South. I cannot emphasize too much the
                                importance of this visit which I am urging on you.</p>
                            <p>The final success of Mr. Wilson’s plan which you have come over about
                                may hinge on your coming here and feeling out the situation for
                                yourself. The future of the Jugo-Slav and the Czech-Slovak States
                                may hang upon your doing so, as may the sound and equitable
                                adjustment of the questions relating to the Adriatic and the regions
                                beyond, on whose equitable and sound adjustment will depend the
                                possibility of a final, durable peace.</p>
                            <p>I will not add more to this letter at this time, but shall probably
                                send you another letter by the pouch which is due to leave here on
                                Friday. I will only add that the feeling between France and Italy,
                                which you will be able to judge of at least on the French side for
                                yourself before you have been in Paris long, disturbs me very much.
                                I do not undertake to say on which side the chief fault lies. Italy
                                has undoubtedly been “squeezed” as she says, and her people have
                                undergone privations and hardships incomparably greater than
                                anything that has occurred in France. She has lost more than a
                                million and a half men and no one could see the way in which her
                                people have endured what they have had to undergo without feeling
                                immeasurable sympathy with them.</p>
                            <p>I will not in this letter enter into the political reasons which I
                                think require our taking more account of Italy than we are doing.
                                This I will leave until next time. Some of them I have been setting
                                forth in my letters to the President which I rather suppose you have
                                seen, but those reasons are more cogent now than ever before, and I
                                feel that you will take them into consideration.</p>
                            <p>There is a rumor that Austria has made just now a separate peace
                                offer to Italy. The last story of this kind was in circulation about
                                ten days ago, or rather the story was that negotiations were going
                                on, and this Sonnino stamped as a “confounded lie.” There is a
                                better founded rumor that Italy is going to make an offensive very
                                soon. It was to have been made last week but the torrential rains
                                put the Piave in flood and prevented it. The public sentiment is so
                                much in favor of it that I believe General Diaz will have to start
                                an offensive even against his own judgment or else yield to someone
                                else.</p>
                            <p>You will hear much of the refusal of Italy to put her armies under
                                the Supreme Command of Marshal Foch. The reason for this lies in the
                                feeling which she has about France, to which I have already alluded,
                                and, I believe, in what also relates to that feeling, that is, <pb
                                    n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0213"/>the apprehension that the
                                Italian people who have been coaxed along, or inspired by the idea
                                that their generals are not inferior to those of France, might
                                resent their armies being placed under a French general to the point
                                of refusing to accept it.</p>
                            <p>Now I will close this letter that you may have an opportunity of
                                “digesting” it.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Lansing</hi>: Baron Sonnino cabled
                            yesterday to me pointing out that it is vital to Italy that any
                            armistice to be granted to Germany should be coupled with an
                            Austro-Hungarian armistice. I brought this matter late in the afternoon
                            to the attention of Mr. Polk, asking him whether it would be possible
                            for the government of the United States to instruct accordingly their
                            representatives at Versailles. Mr. Polk was good enough to say that he
                            would take up the matter with you this morning. Meanwhile I have
                            received another cable from my Government which gives expression to the
                            thought of the Italian Government in regard to the questions you put to
                            them in your note of the twenty-third to me,<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d123fn1">

                            largely on the subject of the German and Austrian armistice. I thought
                            it advisable, consequently to let you know confidentially its contents
                            at once, thus conveying also to you in advance the views of the Italian
                            Government on the note in question.</p>
                        <p>Baron Sonnino, having stated that on the twenty-ninth of October there
                            was called at Paris an interallied meeting to discuss the conditions of
                            an armistice, points out in his cable that it would seem to him
                            premature to give now an official answer to questions which have been
                            addressed also to the other governments and in regard to which there
                            will be a joint discussion in the presence of the American delegate.
                            This the more, inasmuch as Italy, who faces almost alone the whole
                            Austro-Hungarian army, has to safeguard herself against the very serious
                            consequences which might arise from an armistice with Germany alone,
                            which Mr. Wilson has now submitted to the Allies.</p>
                        <p>Baron Sonnino, however, authorizes me to let the President know at once
                            that in so far as the Italian Government are concerned they are willing
                            to participate in the exchange of views of the allied powers at war
                            against the Central Empires regarding a possible armistice, as suggested
                            in the note of the President of the United States of October 23,
                                1918.<note n="24" xml:id="d123fn2">

                                    <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 381</ref>.</note> The Italian
                            Government fully agree concerning what is said in this note in respect
                            to the manner with which the conditions of such armistice are to be
                            determined. They acknowledge the wise care with which the President of
                            the United States has endeavored in his statements to safeguard the
                            interests of the peoples at war against Germany, and hope that the
                            allied powers proceed at the same time to a determination of the terms
                                <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0215"/>which are to be requested
                            for an armistice of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Because of the very
                            high aims the President put forth in his note of the twenty-third of
                            October, the Italian Government do not deem that an armistice may be in
                            any way taken into consideration and, much less, granted to Germany and
                            to Austria-Hungary separately. An armistice granted only to Germany,
                            even when accompanied by the highest guarantees, would make it possible
                            for the Austro-Hungarian army to reenforce, with the divisions freed
                            from the western front, its forces in Italy, which are already superior
                            in number and position. The Austro-Hungarian army would also thus retain
                            in its rank and file German troops disguised as soldiers of the
                            Austro-Hungarian monarchy, as they have already done in the past. And
                            the geographical conditions are such that internal communications are
                            made more easy between Germany and Austria than between France and
                            Italy, so that it would be impossible for the allies to parry in time
                            the danger by the transferring of arms and troops from one front to the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>I thought it was important, on account of the urgency of the matters
                            involved, to bring to your kind attention the aforesaid, and I earnestly
                            hope that you may see the way clear to accede to my Government’s point
                            of view, not only in the interests of Italy, but of the allied
                            cause.</p>

                        <p>14. For the President:</p>
                        <p>Five minutes before I entered into conference this afternoon of Prime
                            Ministers and Foreign Secretaries and without previous notification
                            General Pershing handed me a copy of the communication I quote herewith,
                            the original thereof having already been sent to the Supreme War Council
                            at Versailles and when George read this his comment was: “Political not
                            military; some one put him up to it”. When Clemenceau read it his
                            comment was: “theatrical and not in accordance with what he has said to
                            Marshal Foch”. No Allied general has ever submitted a document of this
                            character to the Supreme War Council without a previous request having
                            been made by the civilian authorities. I have written the following
                            letter to General Pershing: “In regard to the communication which you
                            sent in to the Supreme War Council this afternoon will you not let me
                            know whether your views are shared by any of the other Allied <pb
                                n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0216"/>generals?” He sent me a verbal
                            answer saying he had not gotten the views of the other Allied commanders
                            on this question.</p>
                        <p rend="right">[“]Paris, October 30, 1918.</p>
                        <p>To the Allied Supreme War Council, Paris.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen: In considering the question of whether or not Germany’s
                            request for an armistice should be granted, the following expresses my
                            opinion from the military point of view:<list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Judging from their excellent conduct during the three months,
                                    the British, French, Belgian and American armies appear capable
                                    of continuing the offensive indefinitely. Their morale is high
                                    and the prospects of certain victory should keep it so.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The American army is constantly increasing in strength and
                                    experience, and should be able to take an increasingly important
                                    part in the Allied offensive. Its growth, both in personnel and
                                    material, with such reserves as the Allies may furnish, not
                                    counting the Italian army, should be more than equal to the
                                    combined losses of the Allied armies.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>German man power is constantly diminishing and her armies have
                                    lost over 300,000 prisoners and over 1,000 piece[s] of artillery
                                    during the last three months in their efforts to extricate
                                    themselves from a difficult situation and avoid disaster.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The estimated strength of the Allies on the western front, not
                                    counting Italy, and of Germany, in rifles is: Allies, 1,564,000;
                                    Germany, 1,134,000; an advantage in favor of the Allies of 37
                                    percent. In guns: Allies, 22,413; Germany, 16,495; advantage of
                                    35 percent in favor of the Allies. If Italy’s forces should be
                                    added to the western front we should have a still greater
                                    advantage.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Germany’s morale is undoubtedly low, her allies have deserted
                                    her one by one and she can no longer hope to win. Therefore we
                                    should take full advantage of the situation and continue the
                                    offensive until we compel her unconditional surrender.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>An armistice would revivify the low spirits of the German army
                                    and enable it to organize and resist later on and would deprive
                                    the Allies of the full measure of victory by failing to press
                                    their present advantage to its complete military end.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>As the apparent humility of German leaders in talking of peace
                                    may be feigned, the Allies should distrust their sincerity and
                                    their motives. The appeal for an armistice is undoubtedly to
                                    enable the withdrawal from a critical situation to one more
                                    advantageous.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>On the other hand the internal political conditions of
                                    Germany, if correctly reported, are such that she is practically
                                    forced to ask for an armistice to save the overthrow of her
                                    present Government, a consummation which should be sought by the
                                    Allies as precedent to permanent peace.</item>
                                <label>9.</label>
                                <item>A cessation of hostilities short of capitulation postpones, if
                                    it does not render impossible, the imposition of satisfactory
                                    peace terms, because it would allow Germany to withdraw her army
                                    with its present strength, ready to resume hostilities if terms
                                    were not satisfactory to her.</item>
                                <label>10.</label>
                                <item>An armistice would lead the Allied armies to believe this the
                                    end of fighting and it would be difficult if not impossible to
                                    resume <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0217"/>hostilities with
                                    our present advantage in morale in the event of failure to
                                    secure at a peace conference what we have fought for.</item>
                                <label>11.</label>
                                <item>By agreeing to an armistice under the present favorable
                                    military situation of the Allies and accepting the principle of
                                    a negotiated peace rather than a dictated peace, the Allies
                                    would jeopardize the moral position they now hold and possibly
                                    lose the chance actually to secure world peace on terms that
                                    would insure its permanence.</item>
                                <label>12.</label>
                                <item>It is the experience of history that victorious armies are
                                    prone to overestimate the enemy’s strength and too eagerly seek
                                    an opportunity for peace. This mistake is likely to be made now
                                    on account of the reputation Germany has gained through her
                                    victories of the last four years.</item>
                                <label>13.</label>
                                <item>Finally, I believe that complete victory can only be obtained
                                    by continuing the war until we force unconditional surrender
                                    from Germany; but if the Allied Governments decide to grant an
                                    armistice the terms should be so rigid that under no
                                    circumstances could Germany again take up arms.</item>

                        <p>At 10 o’clock this morning Crane handed me a secret copy of telegram to
                            the War Department received by it at 8:55 which read “Armistice signed”
                            and signed “Warburton”, (a military attaché) at Paris. I showed it to
                            Polk and said that there must be some mistake as it was physically
                            impossible for the German parliamentaries to have reached the French
                            lines and much less to have conferred with Marshal Foch. It seemed best,
                            however, to wire Colonel House at once after getting a clear line to
                                Paris.<note n="26" xml:id="d126fn1">See <ref

                        </p>
                        <p>A short time later General March came to my office smiling and asked what
                            I thought of the telegram. I told him that I thought it was physically
                            impossible. He said that he was sure that it was a <pb n="172"
                                xml:id="pg_172" facs="0218"/>false report and he had not sent it to
                            the President. I told him we were telegraphing for confirmation or
                            denial.</p>
                        <p>Some time after 11:30 Crane said that the United Press had a “flash” from
                            Paris saying that the armistice was signed and also another saying
                            hostilities ceased at 2 p. m. Paris time. I told him to say that we had
                            no official confirmation of the report and that I did not believe
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The President, whom I had asked to call me up on another matter,
                            telephoned me over our private wire about 11:45. I then told him of the
                            press report and also Warburton’s telegram and that I did not believe
                            them. I also said we were wiring Colonel House for information and that
                            the only reason for paying any attention to the extraordinary statement,
                            which seemed to me absurd, was that the French and British censors had
                            permitted the press telegram to come through, which, if without
                            foundation, seemed to me a strange neglect of duty.</p>
                        <p>When I went to the Club for luncheon at 12:45 the Washington <hi
                                rend="italic">Times</hi> extras were being called announcing
                            “Germany Surrenders”. At the Club I told inquirers that there was no
                            official corroboration of the report and that I considered it most
                            improbable. During luncheon Frank Polk came to the table and gave me a
                            telegram from Warburton denying his previous telegram and saying the
                            German commissioners would not arrive until 5 p. m. of that day.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the public had gone wild over the report. Crowds swarmed
                            through the streets cheering and waving flags. Thousands collected in
                            front of the White House and shouted themselves hoarse. I was informed
                            that the President came out on the White House portico and waved to the
                            multitude of frantic people. A dozen aeroplanes were flying overhead
                            performing feats, whistles and syrens were blowing, horns were sounding,
                            bands playing, while trucks passed along with waving flags and rejoicing
                            people. Reports from New York and Boston were that similar scenes of
                            wild rejoicing were occurring in those cities.</p>
                        <p>At two o’clock a telegram came from Colonel House<note n="27"

                            the President and then had Patchin<note n="28" xml:id="d126fn3">P. H.

                        <p>The Washington <hi rend="italic">Evening Star</hi> published the denial
                            at three but the final edition of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
                            reprinted its fictitious report in glaring headlines and did not refer
                            to the denial.</p>
                        <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0219"/>
                        <p>The popular jollification in spite of the denial, continued all the
                            afternoon and evening. Whether this was because the people did not know
                            the truth or else having started to celebrate enjoyed it so much that
                            the object of the celebration was lost sight of, I do not know. In the
                            evening on the way to the Theater we found about the Treasury Building
                            and on Pennsylvania Avenue an automobile blockade and immense crowds of
                            people, so dense that with difficulty we made our way to our
                            destination.</p>
                        <p>I wondered whether the rejoicing was over peace or over victory?</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: Convinced of the common aims
                            and ideals of democracy the German Government has addressed itself to
                            the President of the United States with the request to reestablish
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>This peace was meant to correspond with the principles which the
                            President has always maintained. Its aim was to be a just solution of
                            all questions in dispute, followed by a permanent reconciliation of all
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore the President has declared that he did not wish to make war
                            on the German people and that he did not wish to impede with its
                            peaceful developments.</p>
                        <p>The German Government has received the conditions of the armistice.</p>
                        <p>After a blockade of 50 months these conditions, especially the surrender
                            of the means of transport and the sustenance of the troops of occupation
                            would make it impossible to provide Germany with food and would cause
                            the starvation of millions of men, women and children, all the more as
                            the blockade is to continue.</p>
                        <p>We had to accept the conditions.</p>
                        <p>But we feel it our duty to draw President Wilson’s attention most
                            solemnly and with all earnestness to the fact that the enforcement of
                            these conditions must produce amongst the German people feelings
                            contrary to those upon which alone the reconstruction of the community
                            of nations can rest, guaranteeing a just and durable peace.</p>
                        <p>The German people therefore, in this fateful hour, address them-selves
                            again to the President with the request to use his influence with the
                            Allied powers in order to mitigate those fearful conditions.</p>

                            forth in the accompanying memorandum,<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> which I have had prepared for your information.</p>
                        <p>The questions are: (1) Whether we should draft declarants whose countries
                            (both Allied and neutral) have treaties exempting their subjects from
                            military service; (2) Whether we should draft declarants whose countries
                            are allies of Germany, many of whose nominal subjects—for example, Poles
                            and other nationalities,—appear to be desirous to join the army; (3)
                            Whether bills pending in Congress regarding drafting of resident aliens
                            who are not declarants should receive the support of the Administration,
                            in view of the fact that some of the Allies and also several neutral
                            countries have treaties <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0221"
                            />exempting their citizens or subjects from military service. These
                            questions are developed in full in the attached memorandum, which also
                            sets forth the practice of the United States during the Civil War.</p>
                        <p>The main difficulty to a solution of these questions arises from the fact
                            that, as General Crowder advises the Department, the quota to be drawn
                            from each district under the Draft Act was calculated on the basis of
                            the total population of the district, including citizens and aliens, and
                            not upon the citizen population of the district. As a result, therefore,
                            if the alien population is eliminated from the draft, the number of
                            Americans to be taken from the district to fill the quota would be much
                            greater—in some districts doubled, trebled, or quadrupled—than if the
                            quota had been made up upon the citizen population of the district, or
                            upon the citizen population plus the declarant population less those
                            exempt from military service by treaty.</p>

                            leave the United States notwithstanding the provision exempting them
                            from military service, in the Treaty of 1902.<note n="4"

                            and, I understand, the War Department, are waiting upon the word from
                            you as to whether (1) Declarants of military age having treaties of
                            exemption; and (2) Non-declarants of military age having treaties of
                            exemption, are to be accorded the rights granted them by treaty. My
                            suggestions in regard to these classes of persons are contained on Pages
                            15 and 16 of the memorandum. I now understand from the Spanish
                            Ambassador that his country intends to stand upon its treaty rights;
                            that he had no intention of giving Mr. Polk the impression some days ago
                            that his Government would not object if declarants were drafted. My
                            view, as expressed in this memorandum, is that, inasmuch as there are
                            probably few aliens in the United States of military age coming from
                            neutral countries having treaties <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176"
                                facs="0222"/>of exemption with the United States, we might well
                            stand by the treaties and declare these aliens exempted.</p>
                        <p>I should be pleased if you could find it possible to notify me of your
                            desires in this matter at the earliest practicable moment.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The lack of a definite
                            rule as to the drafting of aliens is causing me extreme embarrassment. I
                            am daily besieged with the diplomatic representatives of countries with
                            which we are at peace begging me to define our policy so that they can
                            reply to the large number of letters of appeal which they are receiving.
                            This has been going on for some time but as September 1st approaches the
                            representatives are growing more and more insistent on a statement. In
                            fact they begin to show considerable resentment at not being told what
                            the authorities intend to do.</p>
                        <p>I have sent you several communications on this subject and hesitate on
                            that account to write again, but as there is a measure of justice in the
                            complaint that we have not stated our policy although aliens are being
                            examined for service by the military authorities, I feel it my duty to
                            call the matter to your attention.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Referring to my letters
                            of August 14, and 20, with reference to the treatment to be accorded to
                            declarants having treaties of exemption, and those having no treaties of
                            exemption from military service, I beg to enclose a copy of a letter
                            from the War Department on this subject, holding that the draft Act
                            abrogates conflicting treaties of exemption by reason of its subsequent
                            enactment. This is undoubtedly so and if the question ever came before
                            the courts they would probably so hold, but such an abrogation of a
                            treaty provision agreed to with special reference to an occasion like
                            the present would not relieve us internationally from our obligation
                            thereunder. The War Department’s letter contains a plan whereby treaties
                            of exemption may be in effect complied <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177"
                                facs="0223"/>with, namely, by the discharge by you as
                            Commander-in-Chief of declarants after they have been accepted for
                            military service and so become soldiers in the American Army. The
                            question is whether the same practice should be accorded to declarants
                            not having treaties of exemption. As I read the War Department’s letter
                            the plan is to ask you as Commander-in-Chief to discharge all declarants
                            (whether having treaties of exemption or not) whose country protested
                            against their forced enlistment.</p>
                        <p>As this policy is of far-reaching effect, not only upon declarants in
                            this country, but American citizens who will perceive a discrimination
                            between themselves and declarant aliens, I hesitate to announce this
                            policy to diplomats here without your express approval.</p>
                        <p>As the matter is of very great urgency, may I ask you to read this letter
                            in connection with my other letters of August 14, and 20, on the same
                            subject, and let me know your views at the earliest moment?</p>

                                service, German subjects whether they have or have not declared
                                their intention to become citizens of the United States and all

                                declarants should be exempt from military service, to which all male

                                were rendered liable, with the express exception of German subjects

                                30, 1917, in Section 18, sub-section (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>),
                                provided the method by which German subjects, whether they had or
                                had not declared their intention to become citizens, should be
                                exempted, and Section 18, subsection (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>), of
                                the Rules and Regulations prescribed the method by which all other

                                citizens should be excluded from the operations of the Selective
                                Service Act.</p>
                            <p>It was further provided in Sections 16 and 18 that, in order to
                                discommode alien residents as little as possible, the Local Boards
                                might in their cases postpone physical examinations until the
                                question of alienage had been determined, whenever there was
                                reasonable ground for believing that the persons were aliens and as
                                such entitled to exemption. Aliens who have taken out their first
                                papers are not entitled to this privilege.</p>
                            <p>Leaving out of consideration German subjects, whether or not they had
                                declared their intention to become citizens, and also declarants of
                                other nationalities, all persons claiming exemption on the ground of
                                alienage are required to present to the Local Boards by which they
                                may have been called for physical examination, affidavits verified
                                by oath or affirmation, upon forms prepared by the Provost Marshal
                                General, in order to establish to the satisfaction of the Local
                                Board the right to the exemption in question.</p>
                            <p>It has come to the attention of the War Department that aliens have
                                had considerable difficulty in preparing the affidavits required <pb
                                    n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0225"/>of them by the Rules and
                                Regulations, and that the outlay for notarial fees in swearing to
                                the affidavits is regarded by them and by Diplomatic Representatives
                                of their countries as unnecessary and in some cases as a hardship.
                                The Honorable the Secretary of State suggests that blank forms be
                                provided for aliens and that free notarial service be given them.
                                Forms have already been provided by the Provost Marshal General and
                                are in the possession of the Local Boards, and the Secretary of War
                                will take the necessary action to instruct the Local Boards to have
                                the oaths required in the case of aliens other than declarants
                                administered without expense to such alien claimants, if they
                                present themselves in person to the Local Boards.</p>
                            <p>The Selective Service Act renders aliens who have declared their
                                intention to become citizens liable to its provisions. The Secretary
                                of War is informed that the Department of State has always
                                considered declarants as aliens and has expressly held them to be
                                such during the present war, and if it were not for the Act they
                                would be considered as ordinary aliens and as such exempt from the
                                liability to military service. The Act of Congress, is, however,
                                mandatory, and it is common knowledge, for which no authority need
                                be cited, that from a National point of view an Act of Congress
                                subsequent to a treaty repeals the treaty if they are wholly
                                inconsistent, and, in any event, supersedes the treaty to the extent
                                of the inconsistency. It is incumbent, therefore, upon Local and
                                District Boards to hold declarants liable to military service, and
                                if found physically qualified to accept them into the National Army
                                unless exempted or discharged on other grounds.</p>
                            <p>Should the Diplomatic Representative of the country whereof the
                                declarant is a subject ask that he be exempted from the operations
                                of the draft and that he be discharged from the National Army after
                                he has been accepted into it, the President of the United States
                                can, as Commander-in-Chief, direct that such a declarant be
                                discharged from the Army. But the President cannot take this action
                                before the declarant has, by being drafted into the Army, become
                                subject to his authority as Commander-in-Chief, and the President
                                cannot instruct Local and District Boards to disregard the terms of
                                the Act, which is law for the President as well as for the
                                Boards.</p>
                            <p>It is believed, however, that Diplomatic Agents will not take the
                                same interest in their fellow countrymen who have declared their
                                intention to renounce allegiance to the home country as they will in
                                behalf of alien residents who have not declared their intention to
                                renounce their allegiance, and that they will be disinclined to
                                intervene in behalf of declarants if the right to do so be
                                acknowledged.</p>
                            <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0226"/>
                            <p>The Secretary of War, has, therefore, the honor to suggest to the
                                Honorable the Secretary of State that whenever a Diplomatic Agent
                                protests against the acceptance into the National Army of his fellow
                                countryman who has declared his intention to become a citizen of the
                                United States, the Department of State communicate the name of such
                                person, accompanying it with the necessary information in order to
                                enable such declarant to be identified to the end that the Secretary
                                of War may, when the declarant has been accepted into the military
                                service, confer with the President and suggest that in his capacity,
                                as Commander-in-Chief, the President discharge from the Army a
                                declarant in whose behalf the Diplomatic Representative has more
                                than perfunctorily protested and whose discharge seems to be
                                desirable in the interests of friendly diplomatic relations.</p>

                        <p>The Draft Act of May 18 makes all “declarants” subject to perform

                        <p>The Spanish Treaty of July 3, 1902, exempts Spanish subjects from
                            military service. The War Department has held that the law modifies the

                            liable to perform military service under law of May 18. The President
                            approves this decision, but has said that he, as <pb n="181"
                                xml:id="pg_181" facs="0227"/>Commander-in-Chief, will consider
                            requests of the Spanish Ambassador for discharge of Spanish subjects who
                            have been drafted and brought into military service. (Same with
                            reference to other treaty countries).</p>

                        <p>Your December 19, 3 p. m.<note n="7" xml:id="d135fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            Under the Draft Act of Congress approved May 18 last, all male persons
                            whether citizens or aliens between the ages of 21 and 30 both inclusive,
                            were required to register in the United States in order to ascertain the
                            facts in regard to persons of military age in the United States. Such
                            registration did not constitute the draft of such persons into the
                            military service of the United States or indicate in any manner the
                            intention of the government as to their ultimate military obligations.
                            This Act further provided that conscription in the United States should
                            be based upon liability to military service of all male citizens or male
                            persons not alien enemies who had declared their intention to abandon
                            their former allegiance and to become citizens of the United States. The
                            liability to military service thus established was passed upon by local
                            exemption boards established throughout the country which heard and
                            judicially determined the cases of those who claimed exemption from
                            military service. Appeals from the decisions of these boards were taken
                            to boards of appeal established in the various states. Of all the
                            persons registered in accordance with the provisions of the Act only a
                            small percentage have been called for examination with a view to their
                            conscription, and ample opportunity has been allowed for the
                            establishment before the exemption boards by those called of their right
                            to exemption from the draft. In the process of deciding claims for
                            exemption presented by the local boards it cannot be expected that no
                            errors or mistakes have occurred resulting in the refusal of claims of
                            exemption and consequent subjection to military service of some aliens
                            in the United States. It appears that numbers of aliens have failed to
                            claim exemption and accepted service in the American Army, thereby
                            becoming practically volunteers. The President, as Commander-in-Chief,
                            has stated he will consider the discharge of any aliens who may have
                            been drafted, even though they may have declared their intention to
                            become citizens of the United States, if their Governments <pb n="182"
                                xml:id="pg_182" facs="0228"/>should request such action in their
                            behalf, and provided that evidence of their alien nationality be
                            furnished. Such action was taken by the President, not because he
                            doubted the right of the United States to claim the service of persons
                            within its jurisdiction, who had endeavored to absolve their allegiance
                            to their own country and indicated their intention to assume allegiance
                            to the United States and take up permanent residence therein, but
                            because of his desire to show a friendly regard for the views of the
                            governments of neutral countries in respect to military service of their
                            nationals abroad.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore clear that if any aliens have been conscripted this is
                            due to their inability or failure to establish their alien nationality
                            and not to any desire on the part of this Government to force them into
                            the military service of the United States.</p>
                        <p>So far as Department is advised there is no present intention of Congress
                            to conscript aliens generally.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I regret to have to
                            call your attention again to certain difficulties arising out of the
                            application of the Selective Service Act to aliens in the United States.
                            As you are aware, all aliens, except enemy aliens, who have declared
                            their intention to become American citizens were, by the Selective
                            Service Act made liable to military service in the same manner as
                            citizens of the United States. The Act contained no provision preserving
                            treaties between the United States and Italy, Japan, Servia, Argentina,
                            Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay, Spain, and Switzerland, providing for
                            the exemption of their citizens or subjects from compulsory military
                            service in the United States. It would seem, therefore, that such
                            treaties must be regarded as having been violated by the enactment of
                            this law.</p>
                        <p>None of the countries who are co-belligerents of the United States has
                            made insistent protests against the compulsory military service of their
                            nationals. Other treaty countries, however, have made numerous and
                            urgent requests for the discharge of their nationals who have been
                            conscripted under the Draft Act; even though they had declared their
                            intention to become citizens of the United States. In addition,
                            non-treaty neutral countries have made similar protests based on the
                            practice of nations in accordance with which they claim, with some
                            force, <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0229"/>that resident nationals
                            of foreign countries are generally exempted from compulsory military
                            service in international conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Certain of the protesting countries have based their representations upon
                            the further consideration that they have naturalization treaties with
                            the United States stipulating that declarants are not citizens. This, in
                            the absence of treaty, is the rule of law in the United States as laid
                            down by the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>Without questioning the right of the United States to claim the services
                            of persons within its jurisdiction who have endeavored to absolve their
                            former allegiance and indicated their intention to take up permanent
                            residence in this country, the Government, out of a desire to show a
                            friendly regard for the views of neutral countries in respect to
                            military service for their nationals here, has worked out a procedure,
                            with your approval, whereby as Commander-in-Chief, you could discharge
                            declarant aliens who had been drafted in accordance with the Selective
                            Service Act, upon the solicitation of the diplomatic representative of
                            the country concerned. But this could be done only after the declarants
                            had been inducted into the military service—really a violation of the
                            treaties and the international practice upon which the protests of
                            foreign diplomats were based.</p>
                        <p>I regret to report that this procedure has not in practice accomplished
                            the desired results. It has occasioned great embarrassment and annoyance
                            to this Department, and to the War Department. It has given rise to the
                            report abroad that the United States was impressing neutrals into its
                            armed forces, a point advertised by German propagandists with good
                            effect. It has irritated the sensitive feelings of diplomatic
                            representatives and their governments. Moreover, all discharges made
                            prior to December 15, 1917, were revoked by section 4 of the Selective
                            Service Regulations, issued November 8, 1917—<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d136fn2">Provost Marshal General’s Office: <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Selective Service Regulations Prescribed by the President</hi>,
                                etc. (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1917).</note> that is,
                            discharges were being made (and diplomats were being informed thereof)
                            which were only good until December 15, 1917. Further there is nothing
                            to prevent the Local Boards from calling on the discharged aliens to
                            report again at any time for military service. Finally, this procedure
                            for the release of persons subject to the draft might be regarded as an
                            avoidance, if not a violation, of a specific Act of Congress.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, this Department and the War Department have
                            come to the conclusion that the only effective method of clearing up the
                            situation is to make a slight amendment to the Selective Service Act so
                            as to exclude neutral declarants from its operation. We concur that from
                            the standpoint of international relations it would be highly undesirable
                            that the existing law should stand unmodified as evidence <pb n="184"
                                xml:id="pg_184" facs="0230"/>of a disregard of treaty obligations,
                            or of any supposed rule of international conduct heretofore observed by
                            other governments. I enclose, therefore, for your consideration a draft
                            of a proposed Act or Joint Resolution modifying the existing Selective
                            Service Act of May 18, 1917. If this draft meets with your approval I
                            shall be pleased to present it to the appropriate Committee of Congress
                            for their consideration. I presume it would be advantageous to present
                            the Bill to the House Committee on Military Affairs at the same time
                            that it is considering certain other amendments to the Draft Act now
                            being pressed by the War Department.</p>
                        <p>In case you desire to examine the matter more at length you may wish to
                            examine the enclosed memoranda<note n="10" xml:id="d136fn3">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> which I have had prepared containing
                            information on the following points, (a) Historical attitude of the
                            United States towards the drafting of aliens; (b) Practice of drafting
                            aliens during the Civil War; (c) Estimate of the number of persons
                            affected by the proposed amendment. From the data under the last point
                            it will be observed that, counting out citizens or subjects of treaty
                            countries, who it is assumed should be exempted, the proposed amendment
                            would exclude about 29,000 men, of whom not more than 50%, and probably
                            not more than 30%, would be found eligible for military service. Of the
                            29,000 it is estimated that one half are citizens of our neighboring
                            republic, Mexico, and about 40% are subjects of Scandinavian countries.
                            In essence the amendment gives up a claim to this amount of manpower in

                        <p>In this connection, I should call your attention to the fact that there
                            are other neutral countries with which we have naturalization treaties
                            stipulating that declarants are not citizens. These countries are: Costa
                            Rica, Haiti, Nicaragua, Peru, Salvador, Sweden, Norway, Honduras, and
                            Uruguay. The treaty provision generally runs as follows:</p>

                        <p>The Supreme Court of the United States has uniformly held that a
                            declaration of an intention by an alien does not make him a citizen of
                            the United States. Under the law of naturalization an alien is not
                            required to renounce allegiance upon taking out his first papers. He
                            merely declares his intention to do so.</p>
                        <p>There is still another class of countries with whom we have
                            naturalization treaties stipulating that persons “naturalized” shall be
                            regarded as citizens, from which it is to be inferred that declarants
                            are not to be regarded as citizens. The only neutral country with which
                            we have such a treaty is Denmark.</p>
                        <p>The argument of countries having these treaties regarding citizenship is
                            that, inasmuch as we recognize by these treaties that declarants are not
                            citizens, but are aliens, we have no legal or moral right to treat them
                            as citizens or quasi-citizens by subjecting them to military service
                            contrary to their wishes.</p>
                        <p>I have just received a statement from the Spanish Ambassador listing the
                            names of five men who have been discharged from the army under the
                            present procedure, but who have been recalled for classification by the
                            exemption boards.</p>
                        <p>I trust that whatever action is taken by you will include non-declarants
                            as well as declarants; for notwithstanding what is said in regard to
                            their having a right to claim exemption before the local boards, and if
                            they do not claim exemption they should be regarded as volunteers, the
                            fact is, as is well known to the State Department, to the War
                            Department, and to the diplomats, that, through ignorance or other
                            reasons, claims of exemption are not made, and through prejudice or
                            other reasons claims for exemption in certain cases, when made, are
                            disregarded by local and district boards. When, therefore, a man is
                            drafted in such circumstances, it is practically impossible to explain
                            the matter satisfactorily to the foreign government concerned.</p>
                        <p>I also hope that it will be possible in some way to provide for the
                            release of subjects or citizens of neutral countries having no treaties
                            of exemption, as well as of those having treaties of exemption, as I
                            regard the impressment of the former under the Draft Act as indefensible
                            as is the case of the latter.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps I should add a word in regard to declarant and non-declarant
                            aliens of Bulgarian and Turkish nationality. It seems to <pb n="187"
                                xml:id="pg_187" facs="0233"/>me doubtful whether, on any ground of
                            law and policy, these allies of Germany and Austria-Hungary should be in
                            our army, even though they have waived their claims for exemption before
                            the exemption boards, and so are in a sense volunteers.</p>
                        <p>As to co-belligerent alien declarants and non-declarants, I think that
                            for the present no change of the procedure now followed is necessary, as
                            few, if any, objections are raised by co-belligerents except Russia, and
                            the Russians are, I think, largely instigated by propaganda. It may be
                            possible, however, that the situation may become such that it may be
                            necessary to devise some new method of releasing co-belligerent
                            non-declarants, in order to relieve the opposition of the Russians in
                            the United States from service at the present time, even though they
                            waived their claims for exemption at the time they appeared before the
                            local boards several months ago.</p>

                            have to call your attention again to the question of the discharge of
                            aliens who have been incorporated into the Army under the Draft Act. It
                            is only the urgency of the requests of the diplomatic representatives of
                            neutral countries and their energetic protests which have been received,
                            particularly from the Swedish Minister in the last few days, that
                            compels me to do so. I attach copies of three notes dated March 26,
                            April 2, and 3,<note n="15" xml:id="d138fn1">Not printed.</note> from
                            which it will be observed that 74 applications for permits to leave the
                            country and 744 cases of applications for discharge have been presented
                            and very few acted upon, and that three Swedish declarants for failure
                            to obey orders to sign enlist cards and don uniforms, in opposition to
                            their protests that they were aliens and conscientious objectors, were
                            sentenced by court-martial to imprisonment for twenty-five years—the
                            best part of a man’s life. They had previously made application to their
                            Minister for discharge from the Army.</p>
                        <p>I really am at a loss to know what to do in the circumstances. Relying
                            upon correspondence with the War Department we have committed ourselves
                            to the consideration of discharge of neutral aliens upon application,
                            and consequently have received many requests of this sort. Since then
                            the discharges have become less and <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188"
                                facs="0234"/>less frequent, and recently the War Department has
                            announced a change of policy which affects both discharge of declarants
                            and non-declarants. If we are to refuse hereafter applications for
                            discharge of neutral aliens we must so inform diplomats, but I hesitate
                            to do so, inasmuch as it means a retraction of our promises to the
                            neutral countries, without your specific authorization.</p>
                        <p>Another course would be to have all neutral aliens subject to military
                            service discharged once and for all from the operation of the Draft Act.
                            As to the legality of this course—a question particularly within the
                            competence of the War Department to decide—I, of course, desire to make
                            no comment.</p>
                        <p>The third course is to urge the passage of the pending Bill (H. R. 9932)
                            providing for the amendment to the Draft Act so as to exclude neutral
                            aliens from its operation. I have no doubt a letter from you to the
                            Chairmen of the Senate and House Committees handling the Bill would
                            accomplish this purpose.</p>
                        <p>I trust that you will understand that in the circumstances I am powerless
                            to do anything but appeal to you again for consideration of the
                            unsatisfactory situation which is resulting from delay in taking a
                            definite, clear position in the matter.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: On April 11th, you
                            decided that (1) Declarants and non-declarants of neutral treaty
                            countries should both <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0235"/>be
                            discharged from the Army; and (2) Non-declarants of non-treaty countries
                            should be also discharged upon certain conditions. The question has
                            arisen as to the meaning of “treaty countries.” As I pointed out to you
                            in my former letter,<note n="16" xml:id="d140fn1">Letter of Mar. 18,
                                1918, <ref target="#pg_185">p. 185</ref>.</note> there are three
                            classes of neutral countries with which we have treaties, namely: (1)
                            Countries with which we have treaty provisions explicitly exempting
                            their nationals from military service. We have such treaties with
                            Argentina, Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay, Spain, and Switzerland. The
                            treaty provision generally runs as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The citizens or subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties
                                shall be exempt in the territories of the other from all compulsory
                                military service, by land or sea, and from all pecuniary
                                contributions in lieu of such, as well as from all obligatory
                                official functions whatsoever.” (Treaty with Spain, 1902.)<note

                        <p>Some of the other treaties end with the word “sea.”</p>
                        <p>(2) Countries with which we have naturalization treaties stipulating that
                            declarants are not citizens. These countries are: Costa Rica, Haiti,
                            Nicaragua, Peru, Salvador, Sweden, Norway, Honduras, and Uruguay. The
                            treaty provision generally runs as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The declaration of an intention to become a citizen of one or the
                                other country has not for either party the effect of citizenship
                                legally acquired.” (Treaty with Sweden and Norway, 1869.)<note

                        <p>The Supreme Court of the United States has uniformly held that a
                            declaration of intention by an alien does not make him a citizen of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>(3) Countries with which we have naturalization treaties stipulating that
                            persons “naturalized” shall be regarded as citizens, from which it may
                            be inferred that declarants are not regarded as citizens. The only
                            neutral country with which we have such a treaty is Denmark.</p>
                        <p>I would be pleased to be informed as to whether one or all of these
                            classes of countries are included in your order of April 11th.</p>
                        <p>In this relation, may I venture to point out some advantages accruing to
                            a broad interpretation of your order, so as to include all of these
                            three classes of countries? If all are included, all the neutral
                            countries of Europe except Holland would be treated alike, and the great
                            body of neutral aliens in the United States would be cared for, the
                            greater proportion of which are Scandinavians. So far as I am advised,
                            there are probably more Scandinavians affected by the Draft Act than
                            there are nationals of all the other European neutral countries
                            combined. If the broad interpretation were taken, a large part <pb
                                n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0236"/>of the difficulties with
                            neutral countries would be cured, in case the amendment to the Draft
                            Act, which has passed the House and is now pending in the Senate, should
                            for some reason not be passed, or if passed should not be interpreted as
                            being retroactive in effect. The Swedish and Norwegian Ministers are
                            protesting vigorously that Swedish and Norwegian declarants are being
                            sent to France with their units and to the battle front as rapidly as
                            possible. In a personal call on April 27th the Norwegian Minister said
                            that ten declarants had just been sent, and he was very much upset about
                            the matter. . . . No doubt the chance of these neutral aliens being
                            killed or wounded at the front would be minimized if they were detained
                            in the United States or in France until the cases in which diplomats
                            have requested discharge had been investigated. This, however, is not
                            being done, as the War Department has just advised us that its policy
                            hereafter will be to have such soldiers remain with the organizations to
                            which they belong until final action has been taken in their cases. It
                            would seem to me that the applicants should be detained where they are,
                            either in the United States or in France, until their cases have been
                            finally disposed of.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that there are pending several hundred applications
                            for the discharge of declarants of countries in classes two and three,
                            which the War Department refuses to consider, on the ground that these
                            countries are non-treaty countries, and in view of the urgency of making
                            some definite statement to the representatives of these countries here,
                            who are <hi rend="underline">greatly</hi> irritated over the situation,
                            I should be pleased if you could indicate to me your decision as to
                            which are “treaty countries” as soon as possible.</p>

                            reply of May 9, and of his further reply of May 14, in regard to the
                            detention of neutral aliens in the United States or in France pending
                            the outcome of the investigation preliminary to their discharge from the

                        <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0237"/>
                        <p>I want to call your special attention to the fact that the War Department
                            doubts the final action of Congress on the amendment to the Draft Act
                            exempting neutral aliens from conscription, and appears to be inclined
                            to the view, if I read correctly between the lines, that such an
                            amendment is now unnecessary in view of the provisions in the new
                            naturalization Bill which has just become law, enabling declarants to
                            complete their citizenship at once. I am so greatly impressed with the
                            difficulties which will arise if the amendment to the Draft Act does not
                            go through, and if the naturalization of declarants in the Army is
                            pressed, that I cannot refrain from expressing to you my views again on
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>By your order of April 11, treaty countries were accorded the right to
                            have their declarant and non-declarant conscripts discharged from the
                            Army, and non-treaty countries the right to have their non-declarant
                            conscripts discharged from the Army. This has afforded some relief. I
                            am, however, convinced that the honor and good name of the United States
                            depend upon the discharge of all declarants and non-declarants of
                            neutral countries from the draft. The United States has never
                            conscripted aliens in its Army, at least without giving them opportunity
                            of returning home, and it has always vigorously insisted that foreign
                            countries should not conscript Americans abroad in an international war.
                            . . . Several senators, with whom I have spoken in respect to the
                            matter, have been astounded to find out that we are drafting aliens into
                            the Army, and have expressed the view that this ought not to be. I am
                            therefore impelled to ask if it is not possible to take up with the
                            members of the Military Affairs Committee of the Senate the amendment to
                            the Draft Act and have it immediately passed. Delay in passing the
                            amendment allows more aliens to be incorporated into our Army and the
                            amendment as drafted may not be construed to be retroactive. In my
                            opinion the amendment should be changed to make it retroactive on
                            account of the late date at which it is likely to pass. The amendment
                            has passed the House, even though the House had shortly before passed
                            the so-called Burnett Alien-Slacker Bill,<note n="20" xml:id="d141fn2"
                                >H. R. 5667, 65th Cong., 2d sess.</note> and I believe the amendment
                            will go through the Senate without much objection.</p>
                        <p>The enclosed letters also indicate another difficulty which I must call
                            to your attention as it is impossible for me to get relief for neutral
                            countries through the War Department. I refer to the practice of sending
                            to France and to the battle front citizens or subjects of neutral
                            countries conscripted in the National Army pending investigations for
                            their discharge under your order of April 11th. The same principle was
                            involved, as I pointed out in my letter to the Secretary of <pb n="192"
                                xml:id="pg_192" facs="0238"/>War, in the case of men being sent
                            abroad pending the outcome of their appeals before the appeal boards,
                            and the matter was rectified by an order addressed to the Adjutant
                            General. If it was necessary to detain men in the United States pending
                            the outcome of their appeals, it seems to me there is stronger reason,
                            in view of our international relations, for detaining neutral aliens in
                            the United States pending the decision as to their discharge under your
                            order of April 11th.</p>
                        <p>A further point has been called to the Department’s attention by foreign
                            diplomats, namely, that naturalization courts are to be set up near the
                            larger camps for the purpose of naturalizing declarants in the Army.
                            They intimate that declarants who do not desire to become naturalized at
                            the present moment may be so ridiculed by their comrades that they are
                            forced to take out naturalization papers. Judging from the War
                            Department’s letter, I can foresee serious charges being brought against
                            the United States by foreign countries for the contemplated action,
                            particularly as it is already suggested that this action is being taken
                            in lieu of the discharge of aliens from the Army.</p>
                        <p>I do not know how to emphasize or express my feeling that something ought
                            to be done to clear up this situation, and that it ought to be done
                            immediately. I should like to confer with you in regard to the matter as
                            soon as possible, as it is imperative that some definite reply be made
                            to the protests and complaints of the neutral countries.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have received
                                several letters from your Department stating that persons, whether
                                declarants or non-declarants of treaty countries or non-declarants
                                of non-treaty countries will not be held in the United States
                                pending an investigation with a view to their discharge from the
                                Army under the President’s order of April 11th.</p>
                            <p>Diplomatic representatives of neutral countries have appealed to me
                                against putting into effect an order of this sort so injurious and
                                so important to their fellow country-men. The Department’s requests
                                in particular cases for the retention of such men in the United
                                States pending investigation of their cases have been without avail.
                                I am informed that a similar situation arose with respect to persons
                                who had been inducted into the military service but who had appeals
                                pending before District Boards or the President, these persons being
                                sent forward to France notwithstanding that their appeals had <pb
                                    n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0239"/>not been decided, and that
                                the Adjutant General was prevailed upon not to transport such men to
                                France pending the outcome of their appeals only by a personal
                                instruction signed by you.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me manifestly unfair to compel aliens subject to the
                                draft to go to France and perhaps to the battle-front pending an
                                investigation of their right to discharge under the President’s
                                order of April 11th,—clearly as unfair as to require conscripted
                                persons to go to France pending the outcome of their appeals.</p>
                            <p>Is it not possible therefore to make a special order directed to the
                                Adjutant General instructing him to retain in the United States
                                pending investigation persons whose discharges are requested by
                                diplomatic agents.</p>
                            <p>If there is special objection to this course of action will you not
                                be good enough to let me know, so that we can have a conference in
                                respect to the matter. I venture to enclose a draft of an order
                                which is worded so as to include the classes of persons whom I think
                                should be detained in the United States pending investigation of
                                their cases. Of course this is merely a suggestion for your
                                convenience.</p>

                                letter of April 15th<note n="21" xml:id="d141fn3">Not
                                    printed.</note> requesting that neutral alien declarant subjects
                                who are not covered by the President’s instructions of April 11th be
                                held in this country until Congress have expressed its wishes
                                regarding them, I consider that the complications which this course
                                would entail make such action impracticable. It would cause a great
                                amount of interference with the organization and training of our
                                forces, would increase very much the correspondence and
                                administrative work throughout the whole military establishment, and
                                take the time of many officers who should be bending every effort
                                towards fitting our troops to take their places among the fighting
                                forces on the other side at the earliest possible date.</p>
                            <p>While it is realized that Congress may at some future date authorize
                                or direct the discharge of the men in question, there is
                                nevertheless considerable doubt as to what final action Congress
                                will take, or what action the individuals concerned may elect, in
                                view of the provisions in the naturalization bill which has just
                                become law, enabling practically all of these men to complete their
                                citizenship at once. Arrangements are now being made to adjourn
                                courts in the vicinity of the larger camps, to these camps, and hold
                                courts there until all eligible, who desire it, shall have completed
                                their naturalization. Plans are being made at the camps to have the
                                attending ceremonies made as impressive as possible, and it is
                                thought that a very large number of these neutral declarant subjects
                                may avail themselves of the privilege extended to them.</p>

                            just received from the War Department a copy of an order issued by the
                            Adjutant General of the Army under instructions of Mr. Baker, as
                            follows:</p>

                                applications for the discharge from the military service of citizens
                                or subjects of foreign countries, steps will be immediately taken to

                                non-declarants of treaty countries, and non-declarants of non-treaty

                            treaty countries, and the urgency of the passage of the amendment to the

                        <p>The question has arisen as to whether it should be applied to neutral
                            aliens already drafted into the Army <hi rend="underline">before</hi>
                            the passage of the amendment, or merely to those who, <hi
                                rend="underline">since</hi> the amendment, have been or are to be
                            drafted.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Judge Advocate General has rendered an opinion, copy of which
                            I enclose,<note n="23" xml:id="d144fn2">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> holding that this amendment “does not except from
                            military service subjects of a neutral country who have been drafted or
                            were in the military service at the time of the approval of the
                            amendment.”</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the amendment may be open to the interpretation that a
                            neutral declarant, even though inducted before the amendment passed, may
                            claim to be relieved from liability to military service whenever he
                            chooses to withdraw his declaration of intention. Moreover, many of the
                            diplomats of neutral countries have expressed the hope that this
                            amendment will be applied to neutral aliens inducted into the Army
                            before its passage, in order that the present strained situation may be
                            once for all cleared up by the voluntary choice of the declarants in the
                            Army. As you know, some of the neutrals serving under protest have been
                            killed in action.</p>
                        <p>In view of the possibility of properly applying the amendment to inducted
                            men and thereby ending satisfactorily a disagreeable controversy with
                            the neutrals, would it not be a good plan for you to call upon the
                            Attorney General as the highest law officer of the Government to render
                            a final opinion to you on the question? Such an opinion would bind all
                            the Departments of the Government, and would have a decided effect upon
                            the foreign Governments concerned, as it will be the basis of our
                            correspondence hereafter with them on this subject. Moreover, an opinion
                            by the Attorney General would take the interpretation of the amendment
                            out of the realm of the <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0243"/>War and
                            State Departments, which have developed strongly opposed views on the
                            general question of liability to military service of neutral declarants
                            in the United States.</p>
                        <p>I earnestly trust it may be possible to refer this matter to the Attorney
                            General, and if so, to advise me of when such reference is made.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The question of the
                            release from the army of Turkish declarants who have been inducted into
                            the service has been and is, as you know, a matter which has caused this
                            Government considerable criticism abroad and annoyance at home. The
                            Selective Service Act provides for liability to military service of all
                            “male persons not alien enemies who have declared their intention to
                            become citizens.” By an amendment of July 9th, citizens or subjects of
                            countries “neutral in the present war” are allowed to withdraw from the
                            army, upon their cancelling their declaration of intention. The question
                            as to the Turks, therefore, is whether they are enemies or neutrals.
                            Obviously they are not “neutrals in the present war.” Neither are they,
                            technically, enemies of the United States, as the United States has not
                            declared war against Turkey. However, according to the Enemy Trading
                                Act<note n="24" xml:id="d145fn1">40 Stat. 411.</note> and the
                            proclamations issued thereunder, the allies of Germany and
                            Austria-Hungary are regarded as enemies for the purpose of the Act. On
                            account of the alliance between Turkey and the Central Empires, and the
                            material assistance rendered by the Turks to Germany and Austria-Hungary
                            in the present war, is it not possible to interpret the Draft Act so as
                            to include the allies of the enemy, in view of their close attachment
                            to, and support of, the enemy cause? It would not be necessary to
                            declare that Turks are enemy aliens, but the Secretary of War could
                            issue a regulation stating that, on account of Turkey’s being an ally of
                            Germany and Austria-Hungary, the subjects of Turkey are to be treated,
                            for the purposes of the administration of the Draft Act, <hi
                                rend="underline">as though they were</hi> alien enemies. This would
                            result in no further induction of Turkish declarants into the army, and
                            in the discharge of such Turkish declarants as have already been
                            inducted into the service. I can not too strongly recommend the
                            advisability of taking this action, if you approve, as it will relieve
                            the great embarrassment <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0244"/>which
                            is now caused by the allies of the enemy being incorporated into the
                            army and from time to time sent to France, and in the eyes of the world
                            forced to fight against their own cause.</p>
                        <p>I understand that the War Department would not be averse to such a
                            decision on your part.</p>

                                Council to which I was attached, by direction of the President, as

                                    of December 18, 1917; Forecast of the Military Situation for the
                                    Spring of 1918; Minimum Demands of the European Allies for

                            <p>In the last days of October, 1917, I went to Europe as a member of
                                the American Mission of which the purpose was to obtain as exact
                                information as possible in regard to the existing conditions in the
                                Allied Nations prosecuting the war against the Central Powers, and
                                the bearing of those conditions on the most effective effort which
                                the United States could make as an Associated Power in that war.</p>
                            <p>The Mission sailed from Halifax at 10:15 a. m. on October 30th, 1917,
                                on two American warships,—the <hi rend="italic">Huntington</hi> and
                                the <hi rend="italic">St Louis</hi>—escorted by the destroyer <hi

                                    <hi rend="italic">Downs</hi> was picked up at the stationary
                                tankship <hi rend="italic">Arethusa</hi>
                                <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0246"/>and joined the escort. When
                                off the south coast of Ireland, and nearing the British Channel, the
                                destroyers <hi rend="italic">Cushing, Davis, Wilkes</hi> and <hi
                                    rend="italic">Sampson</hi> met us on November 6th and escorted
                                the warships to the harbor of Devonport. Before reaching port, at 4
                                p. m. on November 7th, a British destroyer joined us and escorted
                                our vessels through the minefields protecting the harbor of
                                Devonport. We reached the dock after dark, at 6 p. m. of November
                                7th, and landed at 7:30 p. m. A special train was awaiting the
                                Mission with high officials representing the British Foreign Office,
                                the Admiralty and the War Office, who accompanied us to London,
                                where we arrived about midnight of the same day.</p>
                            <p>It will thus be noted that our arrival in England was coincident with
                                the creation, on the same day, of the Supreme War Council at the
                                Conference of Rapallo.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States, on November 17, 1917, gave its
                                adhesion to the Supreme War Council and Mr. House and myself were
                                designated as the civilian and military representatives of the
                                United States on it. In those capacities we attended the first
                                meeting (after the Conference of Rapallo) of the Supreme War Council
                                at Versailles on December 1st, 1917.</p>
                            <p>On arrival in London and, subsequently, in Paris, I devoted myself to
                                obtaining all possible information in regard to the then military
                                situation and condition of the Allies.</p>
                            <p>At that time I had formed certain views in regard to the composition
                                and functions, as they were then generally understood to be, of the
                                Supreme War Council, but which, not long afterwards, I found, as the
                                result of experience, to be erroneous. But, guided at the time by
                                these views, I requested Mr. House to obtain permission for us to
                                return to the United States and submit our reports embodying the
                                results of our Mission, before settling down to our work with the
                                Supreme War Council. As a matter of fact, I then hoped (though I am
                                now glad that my hope was not realized) that the President, as the
                                result of our reports, would recommend to his European associates a
                                change in the constitution and functions of the Supreme War
                                Council.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, we left Paris with the American Mission at 9:30 p. m.,
                                December 6th, 1917, arriving at Brest at 12:55 p. m., December 7th,
                                1917. On the same day we sailed from that port at 3:45 p. m. on the

                                in the afternoon of December 16th, 1917, and arrived in Washington
                                at 12:05 a. m. on December 17th, 1917. On December 18th, 1917, I
                                submitted the following report to The Honorable Newton D. Baker,
                                Secretary of War:</p>

                                    the War.</p>
                                <p>“1. When the American Mission headed by Mr. House left the United
                                    States it was understood that its object was to ascertain, in
                                    conference with representatives of our Allies,<note n="*"
                                        xml:id="d147fn1">The word “Allies” was hastily and
                                        carelessly used to indicate the powers associated with the

                                        Bliss’ report to the Secretary of State.]</note> the most
                                    efficient way in which all the resources of our
                                    country,—military, naval, industrial, commercial,
                                    economic,—could and should be brought to bear, in behalf of
                                    ourselves and in aid of our Allies, in order to bring the
                                    present war to the promptest and most successful conclusion.</p>
                                <p>“The following statement represents the views of the military
                                    member of the Mission, in complete accord with those expressed
                                    by his colleagues of the Inter-Allied Conference (of which the
                                    American Mission was a component part) and on the Supreme War
                                    Council, by the Chiefs of Staff and members of the General
                                    Staffs of the Allied armies on the Western Front, and by the
                                    Commanders-in-Chief in the field. These views are supported by
                                    the independent opinions of the political representatives of the
                                    countries which thus far have borne the brunt of the struggle on
                                    this front and who must be supposed to know the spirit of morale
                                    of their civil populations.</p>
                                <p>“And it may be said in advance that these views are unanimous in
                                    the belief that military efficiency, under existing conditions,
                                    means promptness; that much delay, whether avoidable or not, may
                                    be disastrous in its consequences. Therefore, from our own point
                                    of view, it is the part of wisdom to get in without much delay,
                                    or—stay out altogether. The latter is unthinkable; and so, if
                                    any one, influenced by consideration of minor difficulties, of
                                    minor deficiencies, of the unalterableness of previous
                                    programmes of construction and equipment, and provision of
                                    transportation, says that to get in without much delay is
                                    impossible, the only reply is that we must do the
                                    impossible.</p>
                                <p>“2. By the time the Mission reached Europe a decided change had
                                    occurred in the Allied military situation. The collapse in
                                    Russia had become so complete that, in the opinion of both
                                    political and military men, she must be left out of
                                    consideration as even a passive agent working for the Allies.
                                    This was plainly stated in the remarks of Mr. Lloyd George at
                                    the conference of the American Mission with the British War
                                    Cabinet and Heads of Government at 10, Downing Street, November
                                    20; at the conference of Mr. House and General Bliss with M.
                                    Clemenceau and General Petain at the French War Ministry,
                                    November 25; and at the session of the Supreme War Council at
                                    Versailles, December 1. And it was emphasized by all military
                                    men without exception.</p>
                                <p>“Moreover, the full extent of the disaster in Northern Italy was
                                    known only after our arrival in England. This, without their
                                    ability to put new troops into the field, had obliged the

                                        gives the number as five. T. H. B. [Footnote in General

                                    important officers were absent in Italy. But conferences with
                                    the Secretary of State for War (Lord Derby), the Deputy Chief of
                                    Staff (Major General Sir D. Whigham), the Master-General of the
                                    Ordnance (Major General Sir W. T. Furse), the Quartermaster
                                    General (Lieutenant General Sir J. S. Cowans), the Adjutant

                                    Surveyor General of Supply (Andrew Weir, Esquire), the Director
                                    of Military Operations (Major General F. B. Maurice), the

                                    Macdonogh) and with other military men and high officials of the
                                    civil government, revealed an anxiety due to the backward state
                                    of our military equipment in various essentials and our slow
                                    rate of movement of troops.</p>
                                <p>“Before leaving Washington the suggestion had been rather
                                    strongly made that the movement of our troops to France be
                                    suspended and that the corresponding tonnage be utilized in
                                    carrying food and other supplies to nations in need of them. My
                                    original opinion as to the effect of this was confirmed by what
                                    I heard on all sides from military and civil officers. Of course
                                    I did not intimate that such a suggestion had been made. But no
                                    conversation on the subject of our participation in the war
                                    could go very far without bringing up the burning question of
                                    tonnage. Frequently in such conversations emphasis would be laid
                                    on the necessity for tonnage to transport food and other
                                    supplies. But whenever I asked what would be the effect if this
                                    necessity caused a cessation in our troop movements the
                                    invariable reply was that the moral effect, especially in
                                    France, would be disastrous.</p>
                                <p>“In view of the various suggestions that had been made to me as
                                    to further assistance that might be given by England and France
                                    in completing our initial equipment, it seemed clear that the
                                    problem would soon resolve itself into one of transportation.
                                    Brigadier General Williams, Chief of Ordnance in France, and
                                    Brigadier General Rogers, Chief Quartermaster, had been ordered
                                    to report to me in London. On their arrival I composed an
                                    informal board, consisting of themselves and Brigadier General
                                    Lassiter, who was then in London on temporary duty, together
                                    with myself, to study the whole question of equipment in the
                                    light of the information which I had brought from Washington and
                                    the question of tonnage. Assuming that a certain demand would be
                                    made for an American force by the end of the next spring the
                                    British Department of Movements was requested to make a new
                                    study, in the light of their own experience and of our actual
                                    operations to date, of the shipping data which had been prepared
                                    in the office of the Embarkation Service in Washington. As the
                                    assumption made by me in regard to the American force to be
                                    there by the month of May next makes demands upon shipping
                                    probably beyond the limit of possibility, no further reference
                                    is here made to the English study which, however, is attached
                                        hereto.<note n="1" xml:id="d147fn3">No copy of this document

                                    study seemed to conclusively show that certain additional
                                    tonnage would be necessary in order to maintain in France the
                                    troops estimated in Washington as being brought to that country
                                    by the month of May and to accumulate for them the necessary
                                    reserve.</p>

                                    returned from Italy. Pending completion of data in respect to
                                    equipment and transportation I had had two interviews with him
                                    in which he had listened but had said <pb n="203"
                                        xml:id="pg_203" facs="0249"/>very little. On the 14th of
                                    November he asked me to confer with him at his office to give
                                    him the exact data as to our preparation of equipment, and the
                                    transportation of troops.</p>
                                <p>“I explained to him in detail the military situation in the
                                    United States and, so far as we are concerned, in France. I gave
                                    him as exactly as possible the state of our equipment for each
                                    division as it would arrive in France from now to any time in
                                    the month of May next, including the troops now in France. I
                                    showed him the data as revised by the English shipping people,
                                    from which it appears that by the month of May next, including
                                    troops now in France, we could, with the facilities now at our
                                    disposal, transport not more than 525,000 men, including
                                    non-combatant forces; that without additional tonnage we could
                                    not supply even that number of men, much less accumulate the
                                    necessary reserve supplies of all kinds for a campaign.</p>
                                <p>“I showed him that if we could have the shipping for the above
                                    purpose we could have in France by the month of May twelve (12)
                                    divisions well equipped, with the assistance now being given by
                                    the French and English, with divisional, corps, and army

                                <p>“He expressed grave apprehension at this statement. He told me
                                    that he doubted whether Italy could be held in the war during
                                    the coming winter; and that should she remain in, it would
                                    require the presence of considerable troops from the English and
                                    French forces on the Western front to be maintained in Italy for
                                    the remainder of the war.</p>
                                <p>“He said that the French man-power was going down and their
                                    divisions must be consolidated in order to maintain the
                                    remaining ones at proper strength because replacement troops
                                    cannot be found for this purpose; that for this reason and
                                    because of the withdrawal of French divisions to send to Italy
                                    their forces would soon be reduced by the number of ten (10) or
                                    twelve (12) divisions below the number now holding their line.
                                    He said that England likewise must send a certain number of
                                    divisions to Italy and she would have great difficulty in
                                    maintaining the remaining number on the Western front.</p>
                                <p>“He added that the Russian situation was such that the
                                    probability had to be faced at any moment of the withdrawal of a
                                    large part of the 130 divisions of Germany and Austria then on
                                    the Russian front and transferring them to the Western front. To
                                    offset all this there seemed from my statement nothing in sight
                                    except twelve (12) American divisions and that number at a
                                    critical time next spring and, even that number, contingent on
                                    securing additional shipping.</p>
                                <p>“He was of the opinion that the state of the French morale, both
                                    civil and military, required the prompt presence in France of a
                                    large American force, and the general impression left in my mind
                                    by his statement of the case was that a military crisis is to be
                                    apprehended if we cannot have in that country next year by about
                                    the end of the spring a very much larger combatant force than
                                    seemed possible to me at the time of our interview.</p>
                                <p>“General Robertson said that we must not count on a campaign of
                                    1919 and of reserving our efforts for that year; that the surest
                                    way to make it impossible was to count on it; that to insure a
                                    campaign of 1919 every possible effort must be made early in
                                    1918; that if it were good for America to wait it would be bad
                                    for Germany to let her wait; that events on the other fronts
                                    were so shaping themselves as to make it quite sure that Germany
                                    would concentrate <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0250"/>a
                                    powerful additional force somewhere on the Western front for a
                                    decisive blow; that the man-power of England and France together
                                    could probably not be increased and that they must rely on us
                                    for additional strength; and that, for this purpose, we must
                                    make every effort to get not less than four Army Corps, or
                                    twenty-four (24) combatant divisions in France as early in the
                                    year as possible.</p>
                                <p>“I said that I assumed he meant not merely men, but properly
                                    equipped soldiers: that even with additional tonnage it would
                                    require till the beginning of next summer to bring over twelve
                                    such divisions reasonably equipped; that it would be late in the
                                    year, even without any fall-down in our scheduled deliveries,
                                    before we could equip the remaining divisions.</p>
                                <p>“He said that England and France could give us and doubtless
                                    would give us much greater assistance in the way of artillery
                                    equipment than they had promised, providing only that our troops
                                    were in Europe and not at home. He said that they could not take
                                    the chance of embarrassment resulting from formal agreements to
                                    help in the equipment of troops whose arrival was a matter of
                                    the indefinite future; but that if our divisions were in
                                    France,—if an emergency arose, if they saw our divisions ready
                                    to take their place in the line but prevented by lack of this or
                                    that, they would surely find means to equip us out of their
                                    reserve supply accumulated to meet just such an emergency. He
                                    stated further that even if not equipped with their artillery
                                    our divisions could be of the greatest service; that the
                                    personnel of French divisions was seriously depleted while their
                                    artillery remained at normal strength, and that we could fight
                                    in front of the French artillery; and, finally, that this
                                    depletion in personnel would probably require the consolidation
                                    of a number of divisions in the early part of the year, thus
                                    rendering a certain amount of artillery surplus which could be
                                    turned over to us.</p>
                                <p>“In short, he urged that our divisions be sent over as rapidly as
                                    possible after completion of their infantry equipment, it being
                                    assumed that this would still give them time for necessary
                                    disciplinary instruction and training.</p>
                                <p>“5. The British Chief of Staff having spoken thus freely and
                                    earnestly, the other principal officers of the War Office spoke
                                    with the same freedom and all to the same effect, viz: That
                                    America must make the greatest possible effort early in the year
                                    1918.</p>
                                <p>“The views of the military men outlined above were confirmed and
                                    emphasized in the remarks of the Prime Minister at the
                                    Conference of the British War Cabinet and the American Mission,
                                    held at 10 Downing Street, November 20th. Among other things he
                                    said:</p>

                                        that you might think you can work up your army at leisure,
                                        and that it does not matter whether your troops are there in

                                    be, feared the possibility of being able only to resist a German

                                <p>“It will be noted that Mr. Lloyd George referred to the necessity
                                    of our sending at the earliest possible date as many men as we
                                    could ‘train and equip’. He did not know that the various
                                    Ministers of Munitions were then considering a plan by which we
                                    would be enabled, if we accepted their plan, to complete our
                                    equipment in artillery by using material to be furnished by
                                    England and France and without waiting for the production of the
                                    manufactured articles at home.</p>
                                <p>“6. So the problem of American military participation in the war
                                    began to shape itself as follows:</p>

                                    <p>First: Men, as many as possible and as soon as possible;</p>
                                    <p>Second: Provision of artillery equipment and ammunition for
                                        these men as they arrive in France;</p>
                                    <p>Third: Tonnage necessary to transport them.</p>

                                <p>“It may be assumed that with any possible tonnage that can be
                                    made available, the men will be ready to be moved. The problem,
                                    therefore, became one of shipping and equipment of artillery and
                                    ammunition. If the view of General Robertson, the British Chief
                                    of Staff, be accepted, lack of artillery equipment should not
                                    delay the movement of troops. Moreover, this question was to be
                                    taken up with the Ministers of Munitions and the American
                                    Munitions representatives, with good hope of a solution of the
                                    difficulty, but not until after arrival of the Mission in
                                    Paris.</p>
                                <p>“As to the subject of tonnage, after numerous conferences with
                                    the representatives of the shipping interests, it seemed evident
                                    that full consideration would not be given to this subject until
                                    there could be submitted to them the unanimous judgment of the
                                    responsible military men as to the minimum effort which the
                                    United States should make in the provision of man-power and
                                    supplies therefor, and the time within which this provision
                                    should be made, as a military measure of prime and vital
                                    importance.</p>
                                <p>“The views of English military men (except that of their
                                    Commander-in-Chief in the field) as well as of their important
                                    civilian officials, were known and were as stated in the
                                    foregoing. Unfortunately, representatives of the other Allies
                                    were not in London, and their views could not then be
                                    obtained.</p>

                                <p>“This led me to discuss with Admiral Benson the best use to be
                                    made of our deep-draft transport fleet now going to Brest. No
                                    cargo can be carried to that port. These vessels have had to go
                                    to Southampton for coal. Thus they have had to run through the
                                    ‘danger zone’ three times; whereas, if they went direct to
                                    Southampton they would pass through the ‘danger zone’ twice,
                                    would have the facilities of a good port for quick discharge and
                                    a quick turn-around, and could utilize their cargo space for
                                    steel billets to meet our obligations to England. Lord Derby
                                    told me that the arrangement would be so advantageous to them
                                    that there was no doubt as to our securing the use of
                                    Southampton for this fleet. At the time, this suggestion met the
                                    approval of Admiral Benson, but later, after an inspection of
                                    the port of Brest he concluded that it would be wise to continue
                                    the use of that port, believing that arrangements could be made
                                    that would obviate the necessity of going to Southampton to
                                    coal. This, however, still leaves us with the disadvantage of
                                    vessels having cargo carrying capacity going to a port to which
                                    they can carry no cargo.</p>
                                <p>“I think this matter is worthy of further consideration.</p>
                                <p>“8. The Mission arrived in Paris on the night of Thursday,
                                    November 22nd. The one essential thing that remained to be done
                                    there was to learn, First, what was the minimum demand that our
                                    Allies would unite in making on us for man-power and the
                                    approximate date when it must be available? and Second, what
                                    would be our state of equipment for this man-power?</p>
                                <p>“Only with an agreement as to these things could an intelligent
                                    demand be made for the necessary tonnage. And among those
                                    interested in this latter problem there seemed to be a general
                                    agreement that, when it should be known what the military
                                    situation demanded, not merely to win success but to avoid
                                    disaster, the necessary tonnage would be made available however
                                    difficult it might be.</p>

                                <p>“According to the estimates made by the experts in the office of
                                    the British Director of Movements we should be able with present
                                    tonnage to land one Corps in France with Auxiliaries complete,
                                    220,000 men, by January 7 and two Corps complete, 487,000 men,
                                    by May 15. But, due to the fact that the animal-carrying
                                    capacity of the animal transports is not duly proportioned to
                                    the man-carrying capacity of the troop transports, we would not
                                    get the animals of the 1st Corps to France until March 15th, nor
                                    those of the 2nd Corps until September 11th. Moreover, the cargo
                                    ships as listed are not capable of supplying the daily needs and
                                    building up a 90 day reserve of supplies for a force arriving as
                                    fast as the troop ships can bring them.</p>
                                <p>“At first, it is true, cargo capacity is large in proportion to
                                    troop capacity and, on this account, a small reserve will exist
                                    for a time: but by the middle of <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207"
                                        facs="0253"/>March, 1918, the cargo capacity will only be
                                    just sufficient to maintain the troops that are then in the
                                    country (about 375,000 men) and so could neither supply daily
                                    needs of an increasing number of troops nor help build up a
                                    reserve.</p>
                                <p>“Thus, if no additional tonnage whatever can be supplied we must
                                    convert some of our troop transports into animal transports, so
                                    as to bring animals to France in proportion to men, and when the
                                    time comes that our cargo ships can only just maintain the
                                    troops in the country (which will then be about April 10th), we
                                    will have to stop the flow of troops until a reserve can be
                                    built up.</p>
                                <p>“Assuming, however, that we can get about 150,000 additional
                                    tonnage in operation by January 1st, that after April 10th we
                                    will add about 11,000 tons capacity per week, and that we make
                                    the conversion of troop into animal transports referred to
                                    above, then we should be able to get the 1st Corps with
                                    Auxiliaries complete to France by about January 10th, and the 2d
                                    Corps by June 15th. If then we continue to add cargo transport
                                    at the rate of 11,000 tons per week our 3d Corps should be in
                                    France by November 10th, and the 4th Corps by April, 1919.</p>
                                <p>“It was evident that, if the views of the other Allies as to the
                                    supreme military necessity of our man-power on an effective
                                    scale at an early date should be those held in England, the
                                    slight addition of tonnage mentioned above would not approach
                                    the actual requirements.</p>
                                <p>“9. November 23d and 24th brief interviews were had with the
                                    French Minister of War, the Assistant Chief of Staff and his
                                    immediate subordinates (the Chief of Staff, General Foch, being
                                    still absent in Italy), General Petain, who had come from his
                                    Great Headquarters at Compiègne to be present at the
                                    Inter-Allied Conference, and others.</p>
                                <p>“On Sunday afternoon, November 25th, a conference was held, at
                                    the written request of M. Clemenceau, in his office at the
                                    Ministry of War, at which, besides himself, there were present
                                    General Petain, Mr. House and myself.</p>
                                <p>He began by saying that he would get straight to business and
                                    discuss the subject of the conference, to wit, the effective
                                    strength of the French Army in its relation to the arrival of
                                    American troops. He then requested General Petain to make a
                                    statement of the case.</p>
                                <p>General Petain said that the French losses have been
                                    approximately 2,600,000 men, killed, died of wounds, permanently
                                    incapacitated, and prisoners; and that he now had at his
                                    disposition 108 divisions, including all troops both those on
                                    the front and in reserve. These are in addition to the men of
                                    all classes in the service of the rear. Eight of these
                                    divisions, he said, will have been transferred to Italy by the
                                    beginning of the year, leaving 100 for service in France.</p>
                                <p>“He stated that these divisions are not more than 11,000 strong,
                                    each, giving him a disposable force of not more than eleven
                                    hundred thousand men. The English, according to him, have in
                                    France and Flanders sixty divisions which, as their divisions
                                    approximate 20,000 men, each, gives them a force of
                                    approximately twelve hundred thousand men.</p>

                                        of 18,825 men, and five Cavalry Divisions at 7,343 each.
                                        This makes a force of a trifle over 1,200,000 men.</p>

                                        been quiescent since the early days of the war. Conflicting
                                        views come from English and French sources on this subject
                                        of the relative extent of fronts. At the War Office in
                                        London I was informed that only with the greatest difficulty
                                        could they prevail on the French to let them have additional
                                        front; at this interview M. Clemenceau said (to use his own
                                        words) ‘We have a devil of a time to get them to take more
                                        front.’ While in Paris I was informed that it had been
                                        agreed that the English should extend their front by some
                                        thirty kilometers further to the south. From information
                                        obtained after this interview, I learned that the front
                                        occupied by the British was 181 kilometers and that held by
                                        the French was 561 kilometers.)</p>

                                        The 82 German divisions facing the 100 French divisions are

                                        larger force. About the end of November, 78 German and 25
                                        Austrian divisions were reported on the Eastern front. This
                                        amounts to a total of 1,3390,000 men. Moreover, there are
                                        some 1,500,000 prisoners in Russia who will be released by a
                                        treaty of peace. It will take several months to bring them
                                        home and many of them will be required to take up work now
                                        performed by Russian prisoners in Germany and Austria. But,
                                        if the War College estimate in its Strategic Summary of
                                        October 17th, 1917, is correct, there were at that time in
                                        the interior of Germany and Austria a total of 2,450,000 men
                                        under training. Thus, it would appear that if the Central
                                        Powers believe that the time is at hand for a supreme effort
                                        they can mass a formidable force against the point of
                                        attack.)</p>

                                <p>“In reply to the question as to how many American troops he
                                    desired to have available at a fixed date, General Petain
                                    replied that as many as possible should be there as early as
                                    possible, but that they should be soldiers and not merely men.
                                    It being explained to him how desirable it was that we should
                                    have an approximate definite number by a fixed date in order to
                                    make our negotiations with those who must provide the necessary
                                    tonnage, he stated that we must have a million men available for
                                    the early campaign of 1919, with another million <pb n="209"
                                        xml:id="pg_209" facs="0255"/>ready to replace and reinforce
                                    them. Asked, how many we should have in France for a campaign in
                                    1918, he said that this was answered by fixing the number for
                                    the campaign of 1919 since, in order to have this number for the
                                    latter campaign they would have to arrive at a fixed rate from
                                    this moment and extending throughout the year 1918; the number
                                    that would thus have arrived at any fixed date in the year 1918
                                    was all that he could ask for that date. He explained that for
                                    the campaign of 1918 he would utilize the American troops in
                                    holding those parts of the line on which he would not make an
                                    offensive, thus relieving the French troops now there and making
                                    the latter available for an offensive elsewhere. In order to
                                    carry out this plan, he stated that we should move troops to
                                    France at the rate of two divisions complete per month with
                                    corresponding service of the rear troops, until about the 1st of
                                    May, when the rate should be increased to three divisions a
                                    month and continued thus through the year.</p>
                                <p>“During this interview General Petain spoke with an evident lack
                                    of readiness and positiveness. Subsequently, when I visited him
                                    at his headquarters at Compiègne, he said that he had been
                                    summoned to the conference without warning and not knowing what
                                    was to be discussed. When I told him of the views that had been
                                    expressed to me in England he said very earnestly that the
                                    sooner we could get our troops to France properly equipped the
                                    better. He confirmed General Robertson’s belief as to our
                                    getting more assistance in artillery equipment than we had
                                    anticipated if our troops were in France instead of at home. For
                                    this reason he urged that our artillery regiments precede<note

                                <p>“10. At this conference of November 25th there was some
                                    discussion of the Supreme War Council as proposed by Mr. Lloyd
                                    George, its organization and functions. When asked as to how far
                                    they accepted it, both M. Clemenceau and General Petain
                                    expressed non-concurrence in it. General Petain held strongly
                                    the view that to accomplish real results the Council must have
                                    executive power and the right to exercise this power promptly.
                                    He said this power did not exist nor could it be exercised in a
                                    Council formed as proposed by Mr. Lloyd George. Asked by Mr.
                                    House whether a workable Supreme War Council could be formed by
                                    the Commanders-in-Chief of the armies on the Western front,
                                    together with the Chiefs of Staff (or their representatives) of
                                    those armies, the latter constituting a Committee on Strategy,
                                    he replied that this could be done were it not for the fact that
                                    there would still be no one person to carry into execution the
                                    will of this Military Council. Being asked by General Bliss
                                    whether this executive official might not be the President of
                                    the Council, to be chosen by the members thereof and with the
                                    power only to carry into execution the will of the Council, he
                                    replied that this could be done and being done such an
                                    arrangement would have his approval. He stated, however, that
                                    while, in planning an offensive a considerable time beforehand,
                                    there would be time for careful consideration and expression of
                                    the will of the Council, there might be emergencies requiring
                                    such prompt action that this executive officer could not be
                                    expected to do more than quickly consult the other members and
                                    then give very prompt orders.<note n="†" xml:id="d147fn6">It
                                        will be noted that these views were in line with those then
                                        generally held and before the Supreme War Council had
                                        demonstrated what its real functions were to be when in
                                        actual operation. They were based on the belief that the
                                        Council was to decide upon plans instead of as was really
                                        the fact, upon policies. [Footnote in General Bliss’ report

                                    that it eliminated the Prime Ministers and other political
                                    representatives of the various Allied countries, they both
                                    stated that it was so understood by them.</p>

                                    from Italy, informal conferences continued until November 29th.
                                    On this day, during the meeting of the Inter-Allied Conference
                                    at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, General Robertson, General
                                    Foch, General Pershing and myself withdrew to an adjacent room.
                                    I gave them a summary of the views that had been expressed to me
                                    by English and French military and political men with practical
                                    unanimity, as to the urgent, even vital, necessity of promptly
                                    bringing the military power of the United States into action
                                    with the minimum delay. I reminded General Robertson that he had
                                    told me in his office in London that I could, if 1 desired,
                                    quote him in a despatch to our Secretary of War as saying that
                                    he considered this as a vital necessity. I told them that the
                                    time was now come for them to say, having in view the
                                    possibilities as they saw them for the year 1918, how many
                                    American troops they required by a given date; and in answering
                                    this question, to keep in mind the state of our probable
                                    equipment. I said that when they answered this, I proposed to
                                    present the case, as one of military necessity, to the
                                    Inter-Allied Committee on Maritime Transportation.</p>
                                <p>“After a brief exchange of views, in which there was no
                                    difference, they said that the minimum effort to be made by the
                                    United States should be to put 24 divisions in France, the last
                                    to arrive not later than the month of June, 1918; these to be
                                    maintained at full strength and additional troops to be
                                    determined by the conditions of the campaign.</p>
                                <p>“I then asked these gentlemen—Generals Robertson and Foch—to make
                                    a full statement for the information of our representatives of
                                    the Shipping Board, reviewing the entire military situation,
                                    explaining the probable approaching emergency which that
                                    situation revealed and making clear the necessity for additional
                                    tonnage to move American troops to meet the emergency. I felt
                                    this to be most important because the problem had not as yet at
                                    any time been placed before the shipping people in definite
                                    terms, as one of emergency, and demanding priority in
                                    consideration.</p>
                                <p>“A further conference was accordingly held that same day at my
                                    apartments and the case was presented first by General Robertson
                                    and then by General Foch.</p>

                                    the munitions representative from the United States, had
                                    finished an exhaustive study of the situation as to ordnance
                                    equipment and ammunition. They recommended the adoption of a
                                    program by the respective governments which would completely
                                    equip all American divisions as they arrive in France during the
                                    year 1918.</p>
                                <p>“The resolutions of the Ministers of Munitions embodying the
                                    foregoing were contained in my despatch No. 10 from Paris to the
                                    War Department.</p>
                                <p>“Finally, a new study had been completed by the board appointed
                                    by General Pershing on the subject of the tonnage necessary to
                                    move 24 divisions of troops, including all auxiliary services,
                                    to France by the month of June, next. I think that the tonnage
                                    estimated by this board is insufficient for the purpose, even on
                                    the assumption of certain reductions in the numbers of men and
                                    animals and supplies to be transported. However, it was the last
                                    word which I had received on the subject and I was obliged to
                                    use it.</p>

                                    Tonnage appointed by the Inter-Allied Conference. Accordingly,
                                    on the same day as my <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0257"

                                    noted above, I addressed a letter to that Committee setting
                                    forth the unanimous demands made by the Chiefs of Staff and the
                                    Commanders-in-Chief of the Allied armies on the Western front as
                                    to the minimum effort which must be made by the United States
                                    early in 1918 to meet an apprehended emergency. I stated the
                                    minimum amount of tonnage that ought to be at once provided and
                                    requested the Committee to give the matter immediate and
                                    favorable consideration. A copy of this letter is attached.<note

                                <p>“This letter was presented to the Inter-Allied Committee by Mr.
                                    Colby, representing the United States Shipping Board and who was
                                    a member of the Committee.</p>
                                <p>“I learned that when my letter was read, the Committee was about
                                    to adjourn with a <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> report to the
                                    Inter-Allied Conference. Realizing the importance of the
                                    subject, they took further action and recommended in their
                                    report to the Inter-Allied Conference the creation of an
                                    Inter-Allied organization for the purpose of coordinating the
                                    Allies’ action in the matter of tonnage and of ‘establishing a
                                    common program, constantly kept up to date, enabling them by the
                                    maximum utilization of their resources to restrict their
                                    importations with a view to liberating the greatest amount of
                                    tonnage possible for the transportation of American troops’.</p>
                                <p>“This, for the first time, proposes the creation of a Commission,
                                    the sole purpose of which is to obtain tonnage to meet the
                                    military requirements of the United States. The general opinion
                                    among shipping men was that such a Commission, having for its
                                    object the solution of this one problem alone, would find a
                                    solution for it and would provide the tonnage.</p>
                                <p>“One thing is certain and it must not for a moment be lost from
                                    mind. If we are to take any part in the war, now, or at any time
                                    within reasonable future limits, the tonnage must be provided
                                    and provided now. Even if we are not to fight until 1919, it
                                    will require every available ton of shipping in operation from
                                    this moment in order to get a reasonable force of our troops,
                                    together with their supplies, in Europe by the end of the year
                                    1918. If we wait until toward the end of that year before making
                                    an effort to get the tonnage our troops will not be available
                                    for a campaign until the year 1920. It is inconceivable that we
                                    can wait so long. The Allies demand our troops now; our
                                    acceptance of the proposition of the Ministers of Munitions in
                                    Paris will guarantee, as far as such a matter can be guaranteed,
                                    the proper equipment of these troops in artillery and
                                    ammunition; we know approximately the amount of tonnage that is
                                    necessary to move them within the time demanded; all shipping
                                    men are agreed that with a full understanding as to the
                                    existence of the military necessity the necessary tonnage can be
                                    provided. Every day of delay, so long as the submarines continue
                                    in action as now, reduces the amount of shipping available.
                                    There should be no further delay. We ought to be able to
                                    determine very promptly the last ton of shipping that can be
                                    made available from vessels controlled by the United States. The
                                    difference must be made up by our Allies. But, whether we are to
                                    make a strong effort in 1918 or a still stronger one in 1919,
                                    the shipping must be made available now.</p>

                                <p>[“]1. A military crisis is to be apprehended, culminating not
                                    later than the end of the next spring, in which, without great
                                    assistance from the United States, the advantage will probably
                                    lie with the Central Powers.</p>
                                <p>[“]2. This crisis is largely due to the collapse of Russia as a
                                    military factor and to the recent disaster in Italy. But it is
                                    also largely due to lack of military coordination, lack of unity
                                    of control on the part of the Allied forces in the field.</p>
                                <p>[“]3. The lack of unity of control results from military jealousy
                                    and suspicion as to ultimate national aims.</p>
                                <p>[“]4. Our Allies urge us to profit by their experience in three
                                    and a half years of war; to adopt the organization, the types of
                                    artillery, tanks, etc. that the test of war has proved to be
                                    satisfactory. We should go further. In making the great military
                                    effort now demanded of us we should demand as a prior condition
                                    that our Allies also profit by the experience of three and a
                                    half years of war in the matter of absolute unity of military
                                    control. National jealousies and suspicions and susceptibilities
                                    of national temperament must be put aside in favor of this
                                    unified control; even going if necessary (as I believe it is) to
                                    the limit of unified command. Otherwise, our dead and theirs may
                                    have died in vain.</p>
                                <p>[“]5. The securing of this unified control, even unified command
                                    in the last resort, is within the power of the President if it
                                    is in anyone’s power. The military men of the Allies admit its
                                    necessity and are ready for it. They object to Mr. Lloyd
                                    George’s plan of Rapallo (which, however, I would accept if
                                    nothing better can be done) for the reason that, on last
                                    analysis, it gives political and not military control. I asked
                                    Sir Douglas Haig and General Robertson what would happen if the
                                    military advisers of the Supreme War Council recommended and the
                                    Prime Ministers accepted a military plan which the British
                                    Commander-in-Chief in the field and the Chief of Staff did not
                                    approve. They said that it would be impossible to carry it into
                                    execution without their approval; that they would have to be
                                    relieved and the advisers of the Supreme War Council put in
                                    control. In the present temper of the English people such an
                                    issue could not be forced without the probable defeat of the
                                    Government. In general, they hold that the problem now is a
                                    military one and that in some way unity of control must be
                                    obtained through an unhampered military council.</p>
                                <p>“The difficulty will come with the political men. They have a
                                    feeling that military men, uncontrolled, may direct military
                                    movements counter to ultimate political interests. They do not
                                    fully realize that now the only problem is to beat the Central
                                    Powers. They are thinking too much of what they want to do after
                                    the Central Powers are beaten. They do not realize, as the
                                    Central Powers do, that national troops as a body can only be
                                    efficiently employed in the direction in which national
                                    interests lie,—with, in this war, the sole exception of our
                                    troops which will fight best where they get the best military
                                    results. There need be no political fear that great bodies of
                                    English or French troops will be ‘switched off’ to help the
                                    territorial aspirations of the Italians, nor vice versa. It is
                                    not merely a political necessity, it is also a military one
                                    which any commander-in-chief must recognize, that the English
                                    Army must fight with its back to the Channel, the French Army
                                    must fight with its back to Paris, the Italian Army <pb n="213"
                                        xml:id="pg_213" facs="0259"/>must continue to fight Austria
                                    in the only direction by which it can reach her. This does not
                                    prevent troops of any of the four—English, French, Americans,
                                    Italians—being detached in accord with some coordinated plan
                                    from their main army where they are less needed to operate on
                                    another part of the front where they are more needed. The
                                    English failure to accomplish results at Cambrai in the last
                                    days of November was likely due to lack of reserves which might
                                    have been thus furnished.</p>
                                <p>“But, even as to the political men, I think they may now be ready
                                    to yield to intelligent pressure. Probably no English or French
                                    Premier could, of his own motion, propose what would look to the
                                    man on the street (the man who overturns governments) like a
                                    deliberate surrender of control of some national interest. But
                                    it is not unlikely that those same Premiers are looking to the
                                    President of the United States to help them do, with the
                                    acquiescence of their peoples, that which they know ought to be
                                    done.</p>
                                <p>“And it would seem that the Allies would take in good part the
                                    exercise of this pressure by the United States now when they are
                                    making this great demand upon our resources.<note n="*"

                                    demand of our Allies to send to France the maximum number of
                                    troops that we can send as early in the year 1918 as possible.
                                    There may be no campaign of 1919 unless we do our best to make

                                    with soldiers and not merely men, we should accept every proffer
                                    of assistance from our Allies, continuing our own program of
                                    construction for later needs, but accepting everything from them
                                    which most quickly meets the immediate purposes of the war and
                                    which will most quickly enable us to play a decisive part in it.
                                    This should be the only test.</p>
                                <p>“8. To transport these troops before it is too late we should
                                    take every ton of shipping that can possibly be taken from
                                    trade. Especially should every ton be utilized that is now lying
                                    idle, engaged neither in trade nor in war. The Allies and the
                                    neutrals must tighten their belts and go without luxuries and
                                    many things which they think of as necessities must be cut to
                                    the limit. Every branch of construction which can be devoted to
                                    an extension of our shipbuilding program, and which is not
                                    vitally necessary for other purposes, should be so devoted in
                                    order to meet the rapidly growing demands for ships during 1918.
                                    The one all-absorbing necessity now is soldiers with which to
                                    beat the enemy in the field, and ships to carry them.</p>

                                    may be available in France.</p>
                                <p>“3. That every effort, be made to secure the additional tonnage
                                    indicated in paragraph 1 of my despatch No. 10 from Paris to the

                                    a certificate be required that they are loaded to full

                                <p>“6. That every effort be made to speed up completion of
                                    facilities at ports of debarkation in France. This, together
                                    with using fullest capacity of vessels, will, in the opinion of
                                    shipping men who have inspected these ports, increase in effect

                                    berthed on her pending evacuation from that port.<note n="*"

                                        facilities for caring for large numbers of troops on shore
                                        at Brest. A crying need at that time was a quicker
                                        “turnaround” for our transports. Railway facilities from the
                                        port, which had never done commercial business on a scale,
                                        were poor. There was a tendency to hold transports till rail
                                        transportation for the troops could be provided. It was
                                        thought that if the latter could be at once transferred to a
                                        floating barrack they would be away from the port before the
                                        arrival of a new convoy, even with a quicker “turn-around”.
                                        Improvements in port and rail facilities made this
                                        unnecessary. T. H. B. [Footnote in General Bliss’ report to
                                        the Secretary of State.]</note> This will greatly hasten the
                                    turn around of the rest of the fleet. It will avoid the danger
                                    of a terrible disaster resulting from the torpedoing of a vessel
                                    carrying 10,000 men.</p>
                                <p>“8. That a careful study be made of the relative advantages of
                                    Southampton as the port of debarkation of the deep-draft
                                    transport fleet. This fleet cannot carry cargo to Brest. To
                                    Southampton it could carry steel billets to meet our obligations
                                    to England for steel used by her in filling our orders. Our
                                    other transports can do the same for France.</p>
                                <p>“9. That a more satisfactory and efficient plan for port
                                    administration in France be devised. It would seem that General
                                    Atterbury, assisted by a high-grade terminal expert at each
                                    port, could have entire control of discharge of transports,
                                    troops and cargoes, until men and supplies are delivered at
                                    their destination.</p>
                                <p>“10. That the resolution of the Ministries of Munitions, as
                                    quoted in paragraph 2 of my despatch No. 10, in respect to our
                                    supply of artillery and ammunition for all our troops arriving
                                    in France during 1918, be at once accepted with reference to
                                    every item with which we can be supplied more quickly in this
                                    way than by following our own program. Everything should be
                                    subordinated to the quickest possible equipment of our troops
                                    with its artillery.</p>
                                <p>“11. That, if tonnage requirements make it necessary, approval be
                                    given to the plan worked out by a Board of Officers under
                                    General Pershing for a reduction in the strength of a division
                                    from 27,000 men to about 22,500; the elimination of the cavalry;
                                    the reduction of the reserve supply from 90 days to 45 days, and
                                    increasing the number of troops sent via England to 30,000 per
                                    month.</p>
                                <p>“12. That, unless the division be materially reduced or its
                                    complement of artillery be materially increased, our General
                                    Staff study out a new combat <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215"
                                        facs="0261"/>scheme by which the four combatant divisions of
                                    a corps right together on the line, with reduced front and
                                    extended depth. The front occupied by a division in combat is
                                    determined by its power in artillery. An American division from
                                    fifty to one hundred per cent stronger in personnel than an
                                    English or French division, but no stronger than they in
                                    artillery, cannot cover its full division front.</p>
                                <p>“13. That the aviation program worked out in Paris, and which I
                                    understand is now on its way to the United States, be
                                    approved.</p>
                                <p>“14. That the tank program communicated in my despatch No. 12
                                    from Paris be approved and every effort made to hasten it. In
                                    this war of machines this weapon has become all-important. The
                                    prolonged artillery bombardment to destroy wire entanglements
                                    before an attack makes a surprise impossible. It becomes
                                    possible through the use of the tanks and saves costly
                                    expenditure of ammunition. In the attack on Cambrai late in
                                    November (which would have been successful with a few more light
                                    tanks and reserves to follow the attack) it is estimated that
                                    the use of tanks to destroy obstacles saved 2,000,000 rounds of
                                    artillery ammunition, or more than the value of all the tanks
                                    engaged.</p>
                                <p>“15. That, having in view Conclusion No. 5, above, the Government

                                    concerned the great interest which it has in securing absolute

                            <p>The report is quoted in full because the problems to which it refers
                                were the ones which, during the black days of 1918, engaged the most
                                earnest attention of the Supreme War Council. And it is of passing
                                interest to note the extent to which the forecast of the Military
                                Situation of 1918 was actually realized:—the transfer of German
                                divisions from the Russian front to the West; the spring drive; the
                                culmination of the enemy’s efforts by the end of the spring; the
                                crying need for American men—men—men, whether their training and
                                equipment was completed or not; the demand for tonnage and the
                                cordial willingness of the British authorities, when the crisis
                                came, to provide the shipping for the transportation of American
                                troops, etc., etc.</p>
                            <p>Two ideas in the report deserve more than a passing attention. The
                                first one relates to the composition and functions of the Supreme
                                War Council.</p>
                            <p>During my first visit to Europe I found an apparently invincible
                                repugnance to the creation of an unified command. Military men,
                                indeed, admitted its advantages—some, even, its necessity—but,
                                practically, it was little more than an adhesion to the theoretical
                                correctness of the principle. One and all believed that the peoples
                                themselves <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0262"/>would not
                                consent to anything which would look (or could be made to appear)
                                like the surrender, by one or another of them, of some national
                                interest. Moreover, even with those who accepted the theoretical
                                advantages, an impassable barrier was met when the question was
                                asked, “Who, or what nation, shall exercise the supreme
                                command?”</p>
                            <p>Those sentiments were, naturally, even stronger with the political
                                leaders and would-be leaders.</p>
                            <p>But, those of us who believed that a spirit was at work, growing out
                                of repeated disaster, which aimed at creating an organ for a sort of
                                pseudo-unified control and command, thought at first that the
                                Supreme War Council was intended to play this part. This was evident
                                in all my interviews with military men during the months of November
                                and December.</p>
                            <p>And it was only in that belief that in my first report I recommended
                                in conformity with the general military opinion in Europe that the
                                Supreme War Council be reconstituted and be composed of the military
                                commanders-in-chief. This, to be sure, would not give unity of
                                command because, as General Petain pointed out in our interview of
                                November 25, there would be no one with unquestioned power to give
                                orders to all the armies. But, it would be a long step towards unity
                                of plans and coordination of movements, of which, theretofore, there
                                had been a grave lack.</p>
                            <p>At that time few people realized—no one, apparently, except the much
                                decried politicians themselves—that, in a great Alliance, back of
                                all unity of command on the battlefield, back of every great
                                strategical combination made by that unified command, there must be
                                unity of national purposes, fully supported by each separate
                                national will.</p>
                            <p>It was the general lack of this unity of national purpose and will in
                                Alliances that caused Napoleon to say that he would rather fight two
                                nations than one and, better still, three than two. And it was on
                                this lack that the Germans for a long time, and justifiably so,
                                placed their reliance.</p>
                            <p>It was the political leaders who first read aright the antecedent
                                causes of the Italian disaster at Caporetto; who realized that it
                                was unity of political control that might have warded off the
                                Russian <hi rend="italic">débâcle</hi>, might have prevented the
                                Roumanian collapse and that would give its real value to unity of
                                military control on the Western front.</p>
                            <p>Had the Supreme War Council attempted to work on any other theory it
                                would have proved the final and fatal disaster of the war. But it
                                did not do this. At no time did it attempt to make plans of
                                campaign. It established a unified purpose, one on which the Allied
                                and Associated Powers came to a common agreement, to be attained by
                                a campaign waged by all the Powers, and left to the respective <pb
                                    n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0263"/>commanders-in-chief to
                                prepare and execute the detailed plans for attaining the common
                                purpose. It made no detailed plans for the opening campaign of 1918
                                but established a common policy which all the powers agreed upon as
                                wise. This policy was expressed in detail and conveyed to the
                                commanders-in-chief but it was never decided upon without full
                                previous consultation with those commanders. There were some who
                                thought that a failure to comply with one of these details of policy
                                led to the initial disaster of March 21, 1918. The Supreme War
                                Council in no way interfered with the plans of the local commander
                                of the Army of the Orient at Salonika. It gave advice, based on a
                                broader knowledge of the political and military situation in Europe;
                                if the local plans called for additional Allied assistance it
                                determined, after consultation with the military chiefs, whether
                                such assistance could be given, or whether the local plans should,
                                if necessary, be modified accordingly; it decided the approximate
                                time when the general political and military situation warranted the
                                final successful drive against Bulgaria.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the great value of the Supreme War Council consisted in
                                bringing together the political heads of the governments in constant
                                and amicable discussion of the great problems of the war as seen
                                from their point of view, and in causing each of them to consider
                                these problems not only in the light of its own interest but in that
                                of all the others,—that is, in the light of the common purpose of
                                beating the enemy. It made this one unique in the history of
                                alliances and enabled the Allied and Associated Powers, after many
                                disasters that might have been avoided, after incalculable losses of
                                men and money that might have been saved, to snatch victory from the
                                very jaws of despair.</p>
                            <p>More than once, before the creation of the Supreme War Council one or
                                another nation undertook a military project growing out of some
                                national aim of its own. There might be unanimous objection on the
                                part of the political and military leaders of the other nations; but
                                they shrugged their shoulders and made no organized opposition
                                because, perhaps, it might invite opposition when they wanted to
                                make some such movement of their own. Could these political men have
                                met and conferred, long before, as they began to do on December 1,
                                1917, it is not only conceivable but probable that they would have
                                foreseen the approach and the causes of the great Russian collapse;
                                that they would have devised a plan that would have relieved Russia
                                of an unendurable strain before her people in despair broke all
                                bounds, that would have retained a defensive Russian Army but one
                                capable of a strong offensive unless the Germans maintained a large
                                force on that front, that would have released millions of Russian
                                peasants and artisans to produce the things of which the Allies had
                                such need <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0264"/>as well as to
                                meet their own requirements and that would have relieved them from
                                the intolerable burden which has sunk them in the gulf of
                                Bolshevism. All this might have been done and still Russia could
                                have played a more really effective part in the war than she
                                did.</p>
                            <p>Such constant meetings of the Allied political and military minds
                                would most certainly have stopped the Gallipoli adventure before it
                                had passed the stage of a paper plan. It might have prevented the
                                entry of Roumania into the war at the psychological moment to give
                                Germany a great victory, with abundant supplies of which she stood
                                in great need, reinforcing her own and depressing the Allies’
                                morale. Finally, it might have resulted in giving Cadorna the little
                                that he needed to hold his advanced position rather than the larger
                                forces they had to send in order to prevent the great disaster in
                                Italy from becoming a fatal one, at a time when all their troops
                                were needed on the western front to meet the approaching German
                                drive.</p>
                            <p>It was for these reasons that, beginning with my actual service on
                                the Supreme War Council, I modified the views as to its composition
                                and functions which I had expressed in my report of December 18,
                                1917. If it was ever intended that the Council should work on the
                                lines originally assumed by myself and many others, it was saved by
                                its own conservative wisdom, by not interfering with the commanders
                                in the field and by confining itself to matters of broad policy.</p>
                            <p>But I never changed my views as to the necessity of absolute unity of
                                command.</p>
                            <p>The Supreme War Council, with its resultant unity of political
                                control, partially opened the door leading to the unified command.
                                The way was further paved by the discussions leading to the
                                attempted creation of a general reserve to be controlled by Marshal
                                (then General) Foch. Military men knew perfectly well that in the
                                battle that was then approaching, success or failure depended upon
                                the existence and the control of a general reserve. They knew that
                                the commander of this reserve was to all intents and purposes an
                                Allied commander-in-chief because, no separate commander could make
                                a plan and execute it without knowing in advance what the commander
                                of this reserve would do. Therefore, when these separate
                                commanders-in-chief agreed to the creation of a general reserve they
                                were surrendering in advance, perhaps without realizing it, their
                                objections to an Inter-Allied commander-in-chief.</p>
                            <p>The processes of evolution which brought the Supreme War Council and
                                the unified command into existence were long and difficult.</p>
                            <p>The war against the Central Powers was fought by a Coalition and, for
                                purposes of war, coalitions are notoriously weak. No matter what,
                                nor how vital, may be the common object which binds its members
                                together, in the back of the minds of the political leaders <pb
                                    n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0265"/>there are other separate
                                and national aims which they expect to attain from the common
                                success. Often these aims are such that, prior to the war,
                                insistence upon them would have separated the members of the
                                subsequent coalition into hostile camps. And when the war comes and
                                the coalition is formed and these separate—often selfish—national
                                aims come more and more to the front there is a tendency to pull
                                apart, an indisposition to coordinate efforts to a common end until,
                                finally, one or another may see in a separate peace the better way
                                to obtain its aims and the coalition is ruptured.</p>
                            <p>Napoleon was a great psychologist. He thoroughly understood the
                                inherent weaknesses of national political human nature. His career,
                                better than that of any other, illustrates the point now being
                                emphasized. He himself, towards the end, fought coalitions with
                                coalitions. In some of his campaigns he brought together under his
                                single control a group of peoples, naturally hostile to each other,
                                heterogeneous and dissimilar in national instincts and longings, but
                                not so heterogeneous and dissimilar as the forces recently gathered
                                from the ends of the earth—white, black, yellow and brown—to defeat
                                the Central Powers. When he was successful in the management of such
                                a coalition, his success was due to absolute unity of command and,
                                as a consequence of this unity, coordination of effort. He had both
                                political and military unity of control. He used the single
                                undivided strength of his combinations to take instant advantage of
                                whatever weakness may have been developed in the looser combination
                                opposed to him. And when he failed, it was due to the same cause
                                which held the Allied and Associated Powers together to the end, and
                                which overcame any disposition of his opponents to pull apart and
                                held them together to the bitter end—overwhelming and absolute fear.
                                No nation any longer trusted him. They all feared him. They knew
                                that it was their ruin or his. None could have the slightest hope
                                that by a voluntary separate peace it could attain its own ends
                                better than by adhering to the alliance. All knew that their sole
                                hope was in the alliance.</p>
                            <p>So, the Allies held together without unity of command, with little
                                effort at coordination, and with consequent waste of life and money.
                                They held together through disaster after disaster greater than
                                those which have dissolved former coalitions. They were fighting,
                                literally, for their national lives. It was not until after many of
                                these disasters had occurred that the step was taken that might have
                                averted all of them. It was not until it seemed that the last dollar
                                was extracted, the last available man put in the field, that it was
                                seen that all resources must be pooled, which meant putting them
                                under one control.</p>
                            <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0266"/>
                            <p>But it must not be assumed that unity of effort and control, in any
                                real sense, was practicable before it actually came. It was not
                                solely the wise and thinking men that had control in this matter.
                                The political repugnance to it in all Allied countries had to be
                                removed.</p>
                            <p>The presentation of facts made after the Conference of Rapallo,
                                November 7, 1917, should have removed this repugnance, could
                                anything have done so. Yet, notwithstanding all the facts of
                                experience, the announcement of the creation of the Supreme War
                                Council met with a storm of criticism which was only allayed, and
                                then largely only on the surface, by the adhesion of the American
                                government to that Council and its agreement to take official part
                                in it. And among all the facts that stand out in the cold light of
                                experience, two are of vital importance.</p>
                            <p>The first one is that, from the beginning of the war, all of the
                                political and military combinations of the Entente were based on the
                                assumption of a powerful Russia operating actively with the Allies.
                                Had there been one common unified plan the defection of Russia would
                                have instantly made evident the necessity of modifying the plan to
                                meet this defection. Mr. Lloyd George, a consistent and insistent
                                advocate of unity, said that a single commander-in-chief in the
                                field would know what to do (and would do it instantly) who had made
                                a plan based upon the arrival of an auxiliary army at a given date
                                and place, but which failed to arrive at all. But the Allies did not
                                have one common plan. Each had its own plan and these were attempted
                                to be stitched together like the pieces of a patch-work quilt. But,
                                as Mr. Lloyd George again said, stitching is not strategy, either
                                political or military. Because there was not one plan but several;
                                because there was no one to modify one or several plans to meet the
                                radically changed conditions, the Allies continued through 1917 to
                                follow the same lines with Russia out that they had followed with
                                Russia in. As I have said before, could the heads of governments
                                have frequently met about a table and discussed these problems, with
                                assistants in constant session to work out details for them, there
                                is no slight reason for believing that the disintegration of Russia
                                might have been prevented; in any event, the new political
                                conditions would have been at once recognized and steps taken to
                                meet them.</p>
                            <p>But there is a still graver fact which experience had shown, and
                                which confronted the Allies not only at the time of the creation of
                                the Supreme War Council but from the earliest days of the war,—a
                                fact which pointed to the necessity of unified control more clearly,
                                perhaps, than any other. This fact was the Blockade.</p>
                            <p>It had been quickly realized by all the Allies in the very earliest
                                days of the struggle that the blockade was the most effective, the
                                most certain in its results, of all the agencies of war available to
                                them. <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0267"/>Could they prevent
                                the Central Powers from winning a conclusive military success in the
                                field and at the same time effectually cut off all supplies for them
                                from the outside it would be only necessary to wait for the end.
                                That end might, in the opinion of some, be more inglorious than a
                                decisive victory won by force of arms in the open field, but it was
                                more certain and, in the long run, less costly. When the time came
                                to give the <hi rend="italic">coup de grâce</hi> it would be found,
                                as it was in fact found after the most heroic and costly sacrifices
                                of mighty armies in the field, that the enemy resistance was no more
                                than that of a fragile and empty egg-shell.</p>
                            <p>In these days of wars between nations in arms it is not possible for
                                any of them, even one with the most varied and abundant resources,
                                to store up in peace the supplies necessary for an enormous and
                                continued demand in war. There is always something that must be
                                obtained abroad. And the withdrawal of men from productive labor
                                makes it more and more difficult for a nation to utilize its own
                                resources. Science may do much to provide substitutes for lacking
                                material, but in war there are time limits, even if no other, to the
                                operations of science. And this was true, in this latest war, of the
                                Allies as well as of the Central Powers. It was this which forced a
                                more and more stringent blockade, regardless of previous rules or of
                                national interpretations of them, much to the irritation of the
                                United States and which continued until the United States learned
                                that a ruthless blockade was to her own interest as well as to that
                                of the European Allies.</p>
                            <p>And the character of this latest and, probably, of future wars
                                justifies the extreme blockade. It will make, and it is to be hoped
                                that it will make, future wars more difficult in their inception
                                because, unless the whole world accepts this new rule, it will
                                require a nation or an Alliance strong enough to defy the rest of
                                the world, in order to block all avenues of commercial access to the
                                nation with which it is at war. But it will do it if it can.</p>
                            <p>And the reason is not far to seek. With the modern nation in arms,
                                every old woman who is able to knit a woolen sock for the soldier at
                                the front, every child able to knit a mitten, every old man able to
                                cultivate a bushel of potatoes or wheat beyond his own needs—each
                                and all of them is a soldier; their work is commandeered and
                                directed by the government for the purposes of the war. The
                                non-combatant merchant deals in the goods that the government
                                permits him; the farmer sows the crops that the government orders
                                him. Every one is drafted for the war;—the labor of some at the
                                front, the labor of others at the rear in order to enable the former
                                to stay at the front. Horrible as we may think it all these have
                                been treated in this war as soldiers and with little distinction,
                                and it is to be feared that it <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222"
                                    facs="0268"/>will be as bad or worse in the next one, unless the
                                good God gives us sense to at least try some plan by which another
                                such war may be made impossible.</p>
                            <p>Until recently nations at war settled their differences by a sort of
                                prize fight. They raised limited armies which marched and
                                countermarched and fought battles, until one side or both had enough
                                of it and they agreed to quit with a certain division of the purse.
                                The non-combatant had so little to do with the war that he was
                                regarded as really a non-combatant. He was really the body of the
                                contestants and the rules of war, like the “gentlemen’s rules” of
                                the prize ring, were made to protect him against unfair blows. The
                                prize-fighter must not hit below the belt; the soldier must not use
                                noxious gas. But suppose the prize fighter, after he has come to
                                blows with his adversary and there is no escape, discovers that it
                                is no longer a fight for a purse and half the gate money but a fight
                                for life. From that moment neither contestant will regard the rules
                                but will do whatever he finds necessary to save his life and destroy
                                his adversary.</p>
                            <p>It is the unhappy fact that the rules made to govern the parties in
                                one war result in large part from the violations of the rules made
                                for a previous one waged under different conditions. When this war
                                began the use of noxious gas was contrary to the rules. One side
                                violated the rule and began to use it; then the other side used it;
                                and now all the world contemplates its use in future war. And so the
                                modern blockade which grew out of a gradual violation of rules made
                                for guidance in wars of a different character has doubtless come to
                                stay for future wars, so far as the circumstances of the moment will
                                permit it to be applied.</p>
                            <p>From 1914 to the end of 1918 the principle of this blockade involved
                                the shutting off of Germany and the other Central Powers from
                                everything coming from the outside—food, clothing, fuel, material
                                for munitions, everything. It was justified and necessary because
                                the war in its actual effect was against the nations, against every
                                man, woman and child in them, and not merely against the armies in
                                the field.</p>
                            <p>Now, here was an agency which, more than any other, required in its
                                application absolute unity of purpose and object and a common plan
                                which no commander in the field, no minister in the Cabinet, should
                                for a moment have lost from sight. Bad as it may be, lack of unity
                                may lead to a defeat here or there without necessarily prejudicing
                                the general success. But an extreme and successful blockade can
                                permit no failure, anywhere, in its operation.</p>
                            <p>In the great siege to which the Central Powers were then being
                                subjected there were times when it seemed that their peoples must
                                    <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0269"/>be eating their last
                                crop. The Allied navies had shut them off from all lands beyond the
                                seas from which, in times of peace, they had drawn so much of their
                                food and raw material. On land they were shut in on the east by
                                Russia, and fear prevented the then neutral Roumania from giving
                                them much assistance. On the west, in Belgium and France, they were
                                blocked by the armies of three Allies while, in the southwest, Italy
                                shut them in. There was little for them to gain in Serbia except the
                                bare soil, while the Allied fleets prevented the smuggling to them
                                through that territory of supplies from the outside world as they
                                prevented it, to a large extent, through the neutral territories of
                                Switzerland, Holland and Scandinavia.</p>
                            <p>When this circle was so nearly complete the signs began to appear of
                                the black fates of death impending over Russia. She was like one of
                                Homer’s demi-gods on the plains of Troy, leaning on her spear, faint
                                and spent with the toils of combat, and bleeding from many wounds.
                                She had mobilized—no one knows how many soldiers. Some say
                                20,000,000, and the least estimate is 12,000,000. Relatively a small
                                part of this number—whatever it may be—engaged in the actual war;
                                and then only to bring to her and her Allies disaster and to the
                                enemy encouragement and hope. More than that, the Russian collapse
                                would, in time, have opened to that enemy the great granary of
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile the Central Powers had thrown an overwhelming weight
                                against Serbia, crushing her and at the same time unlocking the door
                                to the East and giving access to abundant stores of grain, cotton,
                                meat, and raw material for her war manufactures. More than that, it
                                revived the exhausted Ottoman Empire resulting in the tying up of
                                hundreds of thousands of the finest troops of the Allies.</p>
                            <p>The story of Roumania is but a repetition of the others. With the
                                Allied promises of assistance unredeemed she was overrun in one
                                campaign and her rich stores of food and raw material passed to the
                                Central Powers to feed their armies and civil populations, and to
                                provide their further military equipment.</p>
                            <p>During all this time the Allies were butting against an impregnable
                                wall in the west—impregnable so long as the civil populations behind
                                it were fed and clothed and warmed. Germany, trusting in this wall,
                                had withdrawn the forces which she had used to crush the powers on
                                her east and south. To be sure, her central position facilitated
                                this rapid movement from one front to another. Nevertheless, the
                                Allies could have relied for a time on a similar wall and have
                                transferred forces that might have kept their weaker associates in
                                safety and have made the blockade real and effective.</p>
                            <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0270"/>
                            <p>All of this might have been done had there been in the earlier days a
                                Supreme Council the object of which was to sink national differences
                                and aims and bring about international unity.</p>
                            <p>All of the foregoing facts together with the disaster of Caporetto
                                had passed into history before the close of the year 1917. It would
                                seem that then, if ever, national repugnance to an international
                                unified control of the situation should have been turned into
                                cordial acceptance of the Supreme War Council. Yet its creation was
                                a contributing cause to the downfall of one Allied government and
                                for a moment seemed likely to wreck another one. It was accepted
                                coldly and had to win its way to popular approval. And to those who
                                were privileged to take part in its work it was an inspiration to
                                see the spirit with which the great political leaders of the Allied
                                world approached and conducted their task. Matters of gravest
                                importance to the safety of the world were settled with cordial
                                unanimity in a few minutes which, did they have to be handled by
                                diplomatic despatches, through the hands of jealous general staffs
                                and of suspicious Cabinets—jealous and suspicious only because they
                                could not get together and work together—would have taken precious
                                days or weeks.</p>

                            <p>In the autumn of 1917 the Central Empires had been defeated on the
                                Marne, had received a check so costly as to constitute a real
                                reverse at Verdun, and had lost a small amount of the territory of
                                France occupied by them in 1914–16; still the general situation was
                                in their favor. Their definitely successful campaigns against
                                Roumania and Serbia, and the Russian <hi rend="italic">débâcle</hi>
                                and revolution, culminating in the treaties of Brest-Litovsk and
                                Bucharest, had practically realized the Pan-German dream of “Mittel
                                Europa” and had placed within their control the petroleum of
                                Roumania and enormous new sources of food supply, especially wheat
                                lands. Moreover they held in France, Belgium and Italy large
                                territories of enemy country, which deprived the Allies of much
                                needed coal and iron deposits and gave the Germans useful bases for
                                their submarine campaign and for a possible ultimate invasion of
                                England, if the control of the sea should by any means be obtained.
                                The Central Empires had only to hold on to what they had already
                                won; the burden of the offensive had been definitely imposed upon
                                the Allies, and with the promise of food and petroleum supplies from
                                the Balkans and Russia—without which it had been possible to support
                                the populations of Germany and Austria for nearly three years—there
                                seemed good <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0271"/>ground for
                                believing that the defense could be maintained almost
                                indefinitely.</p>
                            <p>The initial German successes at Verdun and the British campaign on
                                the Somme had proved that an attack could be made almost inevitably
                                successful if sufficiently organized and supported by heavy
                                artillery; but that the cost in men was sure to be out of all
                                proportion to the ground gained and that a rapid and well conducted
                                retreat for a short distance would always secure a time of repose,
                                since it would require the preparations for the attack and the
                                organization of lines of communication and supply to be begun all
                                over again.</p>
                            <p>The elimination of Russia, Roumania and Serbia from active operations
                                deprived the Allies of the numerical superiority they had had in
                                1916 and 1917, and made it improbable that they would have
                                sufficient man-power to take up the offensive effectively until the
                                entry of the American army as a fighting force on the Western front.
                                The strength of the American army and its efficiency were still
                                problematical and could not be definitely appraised.</p>

                            <p>The need for unity of command within any single theatre of operations
                                had always been an axiom of the military art and had been recognized
                                as a “<hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>” to success by the
                                military students of all time. The extension of the principle of
                                unity of command to all theatres of operations along a very wide
                                front, made possible by the invention of modern facilities for rapid
                                communication, was one of the important lessons of our Civil War. It
                                was evident to many observers that the World War was furnishing the
                                Allies many examples confirming this principle and that the
                                unfavorable position in which they found themselves in the autumn of
                                1917 was in great measure due to the fact that each of them had
                                tried to fight his own war in his own chosen theatre of operations
                                with very ineffective and occasional efforts at coordination, until
                                some disaster to one imperatively required others to come to his

                            <p>It was evident, even early in 1915, that the World War was to a great
                                extent to be one of exhaustion, one in which all the material
                                resources as well as the man-power of each nation engaged would have
                                to be utilized to the fullest extent possible. As each nation <pb

                                Allied nations could only be attained through some agency cognizant
                                of the requirements of all and the relative importance and urgency
                                of the special requirements of each—a body capable of ensuring a

                            <p>However, as I have before stated,—this unity was not practicable in
                                any real sense, before it actually came. There was a good deal of
                                political repugnance to it which had to be overcome. This repugnance
                                was unmistakably manifested at the time the Supreme War Council was
                                formed. It was one of the elements which contributed to the downfall
                                of one Allied government; another was probably saved from overthrow
                                by the brilliant speech of the Prime Minister in which he was able
                                to announce the adhesion of the United States to the Supreme War
                                Council initiated at Rapallo.</p>
                            <p>Even after the Supreme War Council became a fact and had been in
                                operation for some time, my colleagues at Versailles in discussing
                                the question of having an Interallied Commander-in-Chief, while
                                acknowledging as an academic fact that such a command was desirable,
                                expressed the opinion that it would be impossible because of the
                                deep-rooted opposition to it by both military and civilian officials
                                supported by a powerful element of the public press. This opposition
                                grew out, in large part at least, of one of the underlying causes of
                                the weakness of all coalitions. During the early part of the war,
                                when the British forces on the ground were relatively so
                                insignificant, these forces had to follow the fortunes of the French
                                armies. These armies were fighting to save Paris and thus prevent
                                its possible neutralization for the further purposes of the war.
                                During this time the Channel ports,—which were as much an object of
                                solicitude for the safety of Great Britain as was the safety of
                                Paris for France,—had been in great danger. Her people demanded that
                                this danger should not be incurred again. Consequently, as the
                                British forces in France increased in strength they became more and
                                more tied to the Channel ports as a dependent base and their front
                                of operations was necessarily determined with respect to that
                                base.</p>
                            <p>Each country naturally feared for itself in case the other were
                                rendered helpless. So, the British front came naturally to be marked
                                out as one in Northern France and in Flanders, while the French
                                front was equally naturally marked out as on the Northeast and East
                                    <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0273"/>of Paris; and this
                                latter position was further indicated in the minds of all Frenchmen
                                by their determination to recover the Lost Provinces, even if they
                                gained nothing else from the war.</p>
                            <p>The Belgian front and line of operations was determined for her by
                                the fact of the German invasion and consequent occupation of all her
                                territory except a small corner about Nieuport, where the remnants
                                of her army stood at bay.</p>
                            <p>Italy entered the war with “Italia Irredenta” as her objective, and
                                against her traditional enemy, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>
                            <p>All were fighting the war for the common purpose of beating a common
                                enemy, but also with the further object of securing certain national
                                aims. And with these various war aims in view, the British army on
                                the continent hammered away at the Flanders front; France dealt her
                                blows north and east of Paris; while Italy pursued her war against
                                Austria in the Julian Alps and about Valona.</p>
                            <p>In addition to all this, any threat against India, by propaganda or
                                force of arms, aroused the greatest apprehension in all English
                                minds. Moreover, British commercial interests could not keep their
                                eyes off of the enormous domain represented by the German colonies.
                                The trade of these colonies was the source of great potential wealth
                                to whatever nation possessed them. For the same reason, these
                                interests regarded with great dislike the possibility of the
                                penetration of German commercial influence in the Ottoman Empire as
                                well as its resultant danger to the security of trade routes with
                                India.</p>
                            <p>And with it all, there was the possibility, even probability, that
                                the adjustments made after the war would be based on the then <hi

                            <p>All these interests dominated in maintaining the fronts up to the end
                                substantially as they were at the beginning; England fighting on the
                                continent with her back to the Channel, in Asia Minor to maintain
                                the safety of her route to India against possible encroachment by
                                any country, and elsewhere to oust Germany from her colonial
                                possessions; France fighting with her back to Paris; and Italy in
                                the only direction in which she could reach her ancient enemy.</p>
                            <p>And, until a Supreme Interallied Council could show that it would
                                operate with a general view to all of these interests and not to the
                                advantage of one as against another, the fear was very natural that
                                supreme and unified command vested in a general of one nation might
                                sacrifice other national interests in order to secure those of his
                                own. As time went on a strong group in England opposed the costly
                                British offensive in Flanders; it favored a defensive attitude which
                                would enable forces to be withdrawn to support the Italian <pb
                                    n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0274"/>advance toward Vienna. But
                                in the minds of others there was a fear that this might favor
                                Italian interests at the expense of those of the others; that the
                                war might be ended on the basis of the <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo</hi> without either England or France gaining all their
                                objects, thus leaving, possibly, France still without her lost
                                provinces and England still in fear of seeing the Germans in
                                occupation of the Channel ports and of the Belgian coast, with
                                Antwerp as a “loaded pistol pointed at her”.</p>
                            <p>Nothing but disaster, so great as to imperil the whole Allied cause,
                                could overcome the opposition to abandoning these natural and
                                individual objects of each nation and to subordinating the
                                operations of each national army to a general control by any Allied
                                Council or by any one commander-in-chief. Disasters came fast
                                enough. But it was only the one at Caporetto which was sufficiently
                                illuminating to make the Supreme War Council—a political Supreme
                                Council in which each of the principal Allied Powers was
                                represented—acceptable to the majority; while the success of the
                                German drive in March, 1918, was still necessary to make possible
                                the acceptance of an Interallied High Command for the national
                                armies operating on one continuous front from the North Sea to
                                Switzerland.</p>

                            <p>So General Cadorna received no assistance, and his army suffered the
                                almost decisive defeat of Caporetto. It was saved from annihilation
                                only by French and British help gathered together after the disaster
                                had been inflicted on Italy and sent hastily to the Piave. The
                                British and French lines in France had to be thinned and the Prime
                                Ministers, Chiefs of Staff, etc., met at Rapallo and adopted there
                                the protocol creating the Supreme War Council.</p>
                            <p>As already stated this Rapallo agreement met with opposition. Many
                                held that it showed an unpatriotic tendency to surrender the control
                                of national armies. By tacit consent the future was left to show how
                                useful or harmful the Supreme War Council would prove in practice;
                                it was saved by its own conservative wisdom, by not interfering with
                                the functions of the military commanders in the field, and by
                                confining itself to questions of broad policy and of general
                                utilization of resources and distribution of forces. The Supreme War
                                Council was created to secure coordination, political and otherwise,
                                on the Western front, but in practice it extended its functions to
                                all the others. And it made possible unified command on the
                                principal front when the terrible experience of March, 1918,
                                came.</p>

                                with the commanders-in-chief” and with certain other limitations.
                                This step met with opposition. Its principle was approved, but
                                commanding generals objected to the “ear-marking” of certain of
                                their divisions for use with a general reserve; and the matter had
                                not yet been settled when the German avalanche fell on General
                                Gough’s army on March 21st, 1918.</p>
                            <p>The American and Italian armies had, for the moment, no direct
                                concern in this matter, and the measures to be taken to meet the
                                emergency were a question for adjustment between the French and
                                British authorities. Mr. Clemenceau for the former and Lord Milner
                                for the latter met at Doullens on March 26th and signed the
                                convention making General Foch nominally Commander-in-Chief. But he
                                was limited to “advisory and co-ordinating” powers; and as he could
                                issue no orders, he could not co-ordinate.</p>
                            <p>The inefficacy of this effort toward securing unity of command,
                                without arousing the opposition of the narrow nationalistic elements
                                in the armies and civilian populations, led to the conference at
                                Beauvais, April 3d, which was attended by Mr. Lloyd George, Mr.
                                Clemenceau, Generals Foch, Sir Douglas Haig, Pershing, Petain, Sir
                                Henry Wilson and myself. General Foch explained very dispassionately
                                his difficulties and said that the false position he occupied made
                                him little more than another element of delay and discord; that
                                under these circumstances he considered it would be better for him
                                to resign his position. This led to a new convention, signed within
                                the hour, charging him “with the duty of co-ordinating the action of
                                the Allied armies on the Western front; and with this object in
                                view” conferring “upon him all the powers necessary for its
                                effective accomplishment”; but it was still considered necessary to
                                add the limitation that “each Commander-in-Chief shall have the
                                right to appeal to his government if in his opinion his army finds
                                itself placed in danger by any instructions received from General
                                Foch”. The principle of separate national control of each army was
                                dying hard. Nothing less than the good sense, kindly tact, personal
                                magnetism and thorough professional qualifications of General Foch
                                could have <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0276"/>secured the
                                degree of co-operation necessary to insure the successes, the
                                prestige of which eventually made him indeed the Interallied
                                Commander-in-Chief on the Western front.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the discussions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme
                                War Council at Abbeville, May 1st and 2nd, the definition of the
                                Western front as extending “from the North Sea to the Adriatic”
                                raised the question of General Foch’s relations to the Italian army.
                                The Italians, not fully realizing the extent of the powers conferred
                                upon General Foch by the Conference of April 3d at Beauvais, had
                                requested that these powers be extended to him with reference to
                                their own front. When it was pointed out that this would give
                                General Foch the power to remove troops from the Italian front in
                                his discretion as well as the power to send troops to that front,
                                the Italian Representative said that they could not consent to the
                                exercise of such a power, but finally accepted the following agreement:<list>

                                        would agree that there should be a General-in-Chief of the
                                        Allied armies on the Western front, and that this
                                        General-in-Chief should be General Foch.”</item>

                            <p>This, it will be seen, gave to General Foch over the Italian front
                                only the advisory and ineffective co-ordinating powers that had been
                                originally given to him on the Western front by the Conference of
                                Doullens. It was only on the condition that independent Allied
                                armies be sent to assist the Italian Army in Italy that General Foch
                                could exercise the full powers of an Allied Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                            <p>The authority of General Foch as Commander-in-Chief of all Allied
                                troops on the Western front was never accepted for the Belgian army;
                                but this army actually did co-operate with him to the extent

                                    been appointed Inter-Allied Commander-in-Chief of the Army of

                            <p>The Caporetto disaster threw the Italian army into confusion and, for
                                a short time, made its escape doubtful. The British and French
                                governments rushed troops to their assistance and General Foch the
                                French Chief of Staff, visited the Italian General Head-quarters and
                                arranged for a complete rehabilitation of the Italian army,
                                including a system of schools for the training of officers.</p>
                            <p>The heads of the British, French and Italian governments, the ones

                                conference at Rapallo and considered ways and means of insuring
                                closer co-ordination and unity of action in waging the war. The
                                formation of the Supreme War Council was decided upon, and the
                                session of the Rapallo Conference on 7th November, 1917, became the
                                first session of the new body.</p>

                                <p>“II. (1.) With a view to the better co-ordination of military
                                    action on the Western front a Supreme War Council is created,
                                    composed of the Prime Minister and a Member of the Government of
                                    each of the Great Powers whose armies are fighting on that
                                    front. The extension of the scope of the Council to other fronts
                                    is reserved for discussion with the other Great Powers.</p>
                                <p>(2) The Supreme War Council has for its mission to watch over the
                                    general conduct of the war. It prepares recommendations for the
                                    decision of the Governments, and keeps itself informed of their
                                    execution, and reports thereon to the respective
                                    Governments.</p>
                                <p>(3) The General Staffs and Military Commands of the armies of
                                    each Power charged with the conduct of military operations
                                    remain responsible to their respective Governments.</p>
                                <p>(4) The general war plans drawn up by the competent Military
                                    Authorities are submitted to the Supreme War Council, which,
                                    under the high authority of the Governments, insures their
                                    concordance, and submits, if need be, any necessary changes.</p>

                                <p>(5) Each Power delegates to the Supreme War Council one Permanent
                                    Military Representative whose exclusive function is to act as
                                    technical adviser to the Council.</p>
                                <p>(6) The Military Representatives receive from the Government and
                                    the competent Military Authorities of their country all the
                                    proposals, information, and documents relating to the conduct of
                                    the war.</p>
                                <p>(7) The Military Representatives watch day by day the situation
                                    of the forces, and of the means of all kinds of which the Allied
                                    armies and the enemy armies dispose.</p>
                                <p>(8) The Supreme War Council meets normally at Versailles, where
                                    the Permanent Military Representatives and their staffs are
                                    established. They may meet at other places as may be agreed
                                    upon, according to circumstances. The meetings of the Supreme
                                    War Council will take place at least once a month.</p>
                                <p>“III. The Permanent Military Representatives will be as follows:—

                                Representatives on the Supreme War Council, General Foch was
                                relieved from his duty and General Weygand thereafter (until his

                                Supreme War Council on November 17, 1917, and from that date the

                                sound, in accord with the military principle that war is but a
                                continuation of political policy in a new form, and affording

                                governments. The Supreme War Council did not supersede the
                                commanders-in-chief but gave them for their guidance an expression
                                of the definite policy of the Allied Governments. It was not to act
                                as a commander-in-chief, but as an agency for the adoption and
                                maintenance of a general policy for the Allies in the prosecution of
                                the war, consistent with the total resources available and the most
                                effective distribution of their resources among the various theatres
                                of operation.</p>
                            <p>While paragraph (1) of the resolution quoted above shows that the
                                immediate problem was “co-ordination of military effort on the

                                found from the outset that the general military situation had to be
                                considered in reaching a decision in any particular case. Indeed, at
                                the first session it was agreed, as suggested by Mr. Lloyd George,
                                that “the Supreme War Council should concern itself with all the
                                fronts where the Allied armies were fighting in common”.</p>
                            <p>The original resolution of the Rapallo Conference provided that the
                                new body should consist of “the Prime Minister and a member of the

                                that (the western) front”. The first session, being the one of the
                                Rapallo Conference, was attended only by the representatives of
                                France, Great Britain and Italy.</p>
                            <p>The formation of the Supreme War Council was announced by Mr. Lloyd
                                George in a speech made at a diplomatic luncheon in Paris on 12th
                                November, 1917. He was criticized by a section of the English press
                                and in the House of Commons, on his return to London, for this
                                speech and for his assent to imposing this interallied control upon
                                the British forces; and, to aid in meeting this, he requested the
                                adhesion of the United States to the plan of Rapallo in time for him
                                to announce the fact in his speech defending his attitude to be made
                                on the 19th of November in the House of Commons. Mr. House, then
                                chief of a special American Mission in Europe, was notified on 17th

                                military representatives. In those capacities we attended the second
                                session at Versailles, France, on December 1, 1917. But at no time
                                did the United States Government have a representative at any
                                session of the Supreme War Council who could speak for that
                                Government as the Prime Ministers of the Allied Governments could
                                speak for theirs. The resolutions passed at the various sessions
                                were, therefore, cabled to Washington by me, as the American
                                Military Representative, immediately after their adoption by the
                                prime ministers of the other powers, for acceptance or rejection by
                                the President as the fourth member of the Supreme War Council.<note

                                    Supreme War Council should represent a common purpose, all such
                                    action was required to be unanimous. T. H. B. [Footnote in the

                            <p>Representation on the Supreme War Council was limited to the Great
                                Powers because, if all the smaller Associated Powers were
                                represented, it would be so large as to be unwieldy, with the
                                necessary result that it could not reach a decision promptly.
                                Moreover, the war was being financed by the Great Powers and, to a
                                large extent, was being fought by them who in fact, found it
                                necessary to assist the smaller Powers with men and matériel,—they
                                being unable to wage even their small share of the war without such
                                help. It was therefore not a practical injustice to limit them to
                                participation in its deliberations when matters especially
                                concerning them were under consideration, and provision was made for
                                the presence and hearing of their representatives on all such
                                occasions.</p>
                            <p>It was decided that the Supreme War Council should normally meet at
                                Versailles, France, and here the Military Representatives and other
                                permanent personnel were stationed. In reaching this decision the
                                conferees were actuated by the desire to prevent any appearance of
                                the Council’s being under the special influence of any one
                                government, as might have been the case if its home were established
                                in any one of the capitals, and at the same time to give it a
                                central location, conveniently accessible to the Governments most
                                concerned and to the Headquarters of the various armies on the most
                                critical front. Nevertheless, when convenience required it, sessions
                                were held at other places.</p>

                                political representative of his government. The four Military
                                Representatives constituted a permanent committee, constantly in
                                session, informed at all times as to the military situation on all
                                fronts and at home, and prepared to advise their own governments as
                                to the attitude and interests of each other government in regard to
                                any military or politico-military inter-allied question arising or
                                that might arise. They were also the joint military advisers of the
                                Supreme War Council, submitting their recommendations to the latter
                                in the form of unanimously adopted joint notes. When there was a
                                difference of opinion among them, or when advice on some particular
                                subject was asked by one or another government or later (after the
                                Armistice) by the Supreme Council of the Allied and Associated
                                Powers, the recommendations were put in the form of special reports.
                                The Military Representatives were especially enjoined “to bear in
                                mind that their function is to advise the Supreme War Council as a
                                whole and not merely as the representatives of their respective

                                based their recommendations, as a rule and mainly, upon the military

                                determine the political practicability of carrying them into effect.

                                Representatives no duty of execution; charging them however with the
                                duty of following the execution by each country of the part allotted
                                to it in any general operation or undertaking and keeping it

                                Being preoccupied with none of the duties of command or of the
                                detailed operations of a campaign, which necessarily demanded the
                                continual attention of the commanding generals of the various
                                national armies, and of the commanders-in-chief on the different
                                fronts, the Military Representatives were able to study with more

                                events on all the various fronts taken as a whole. They were <pb

                                character—offensive or defensive—that military operations there
                                should assume, and to suggest measures that would bring conflicting

                                resolutions adopted at the Second Session of the Supreme War Council

                            <p>Each Military Representative designated one of his staff as secretary
                                for his section. The four secretaries so named constituted the Joint
                                Secretariat contemplated in the above resolution and organized a
                                system of records and of preparing agenda for the Supreme War
                                Council and all its immediately dependent agencies, which it may be
                                of interest to outline, since it was found to be both practical and
                                generally satisfactory and would be applicable to any interallied
                                boards or commissions that may be constituted in the future. In
                                fact, the methods adopted by the Supreme War Council were
                                subsequently adhered to for the work of the Peace Conference.</p>
                            <p>Since each section necessarily had a considerable amount of
                                correspondence with its own government and its own army headquarters
                                which was of no interest to the other sections and in some cases of
                                a character such that it could not properly be given to them, and
                                since it was foreseen that upon the dissolution of the Supreme War
                                Council each government would want a complete record of its
                                operations, the idea of a single central room of archives or record
                                files was from the very beginning considered inadvisable. Each
                                section, therefore, kept its own records according to the methods in
                                vogue in its own government service; joint records, such as minutes,
                                joint notes, joint reports, etc., being made in quadruplicate and
                                translations into the various languages compared by the four
                                secretaries acting together. In this way there was an authenticated
                                and identical copy of such joint records for file in each
                                section.</p>

                                may be briefly outlined as follows:<list>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The meetings of the Supreme War
                                        Council were presided over by the Prime Minister of the
                                        country in which the particular session was being
                                        held.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The meetings of the Military
                                        Representatives were presided over by the Military
                                        Representatives in turn, their names being arranged on a
                                        roster in the order of the entry of their country into the
                                        war.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) In the absence of a Military
                                        Representative his Chief of Staff was authorized to replace
                                        him and to sign joint recommendations for him; but the Chief
                                        of Staff could not act as Chairman of a meeting and the
                                        chairmanship fell to the Military Representative present who
                                        was next on the roster. The presence of three Military
                                        Representatives was necessary to constitute a quorum.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The secretary whose chief was
                                        to preside at any meeting was responsible for the
                                        preparation in advance of the agenda for the coming meeting.
                                        In the case of the Supreme War Council inquiry was made of
                                        the governments as to the questions they wished to put on
                                        the agenda. In the case of the Military Representatives and
                                        other inter-allied committees, the agenda were made up on
                                        consultation with the Military or other technical
                                        Representatives; also by direction of one or another of the
                                        governments. The agenda were issued as long as possible
                                        before the meeting in order to permit each representative to
                                        prepare himself on the questions to be discussed. It was a
                                        general rule that the action which any representative
                                        proposed should be taken, was reduced to writing and
                                        circulated with the agenda for the information of his
                                        colleagues. Experience showed that it was almost imperative
                                        to have a written text to discuss in order to arrive at a
                                        conclusion within a reasonable time.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) The resolutions passed and
                                        decisions reached were reduced to writing at the meeting, or
                                        by the Joint Secretariat immediately after the meeting, in
                                        order to prevent any subsequent discussion arising from a
                                        difference of opinion as to the precise sense of the
                                        meeting.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The minutes for each meeting
                                        were written up immediately thereafter by the secretary
                                        whose chief had acted as chairman and were circulated among
                                        the different sections, usually within 24 hours of the close
                                        of the meeting. This first draft of the minutes was subject
                                        to correction by the persons who participated in the
                                        meeting, provided the corrections were submitted within a
                                        reasonable length of time.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) The Military Representatives
                                        signed their own joint notes and recommendations and the
                                        minutes of their meetings in quadruplicate. Members of other
                                        inter-allied committees signed only their joint notes or
                                        recommendations, one copy for each government.</item>
                                    <item>(<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) Each secretary was charged with
                                        the duty of communicating such part of the record to the
                                        members or representatives of his government as concerned
                                        them.</item>

                            <p>The British Section was the first to be fully organized and in
                                operation. It consisted, at the beginning, of 26 officers and 104
                                enlisted men and clerks. Being intended for what might be called war
                                plans work rather than for the executive work necessary to
                                coordinate the operations of a campaign, its organization differed
                                from that usual in the staff of a commanding general and contained
                                certain special features.</p>
                            <p>The officers were divided into a committee on the military affairs of
                                Allied and Neutral countries, a committee on the military affairs of
                                the Enemy and Neutral countries, a committee on Man Power and
                                Matériel, a Political Branch, and a Secretariat and Administrative
                                Branch.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Allied and Neutral Branch.</p>
                            <p>It was the duty of this branch to study the military situation on all
                                fronts, from the standpoint of an imaginary generalissimo. The
                                situation was repeatedly summarized from this point of view and
                                studies were made as to possible action that might be taken by the
                                Allies and the best way to counter the possible moves by the enemy,
                                as anticipated by the Committee on Enemy and Neutral affairs.</p>
                            <p>These reports were submitted whenever any marked change in the
                                situation or other emergency made it seem advisable. Unless such an
                                occasion arose these reports were regularly submitted weekly.</p>
                            <p>In view of the broad scope of the studies made, different officers of
                                the committee specialized on the different fronts where operations
                                were going on.</p>

                            <p>This branch functioned in the same manner as the Allied and Neutral
                                Committee except that the situation was viewed, as far as available
                                information permitted, from the point of view of the
                                Commander-in-chief of the enemy army. The work of these two
                                committees was, therefore, complementary and their internal
                                organization was the same. The positions of the Allied and Enemy
                                armies in each theatre of operations were kept posted in a single
                                common map room for the use of both committees. It may be stated
                                that such studies in any of the Military Sections were cordially
                                placed at the disposition of all the Sections.</p>

                                question of munitions and armament; and the third, with questions of
                                supplies and transportation. It was the duty of this committee to
                                keep the essential facts relating to its work constantly <pb n="241"

                            <p>This committee issued weekly Allied and Enemy Strength returns for
                                all fronts, compiled from the information obtained from their own
                                war office and General Headquarters, and from the other sections of
                                the Supreme War Council. These estimates included combatant
                                strength, auxiliary personnel, heavy guns, light guns, machine guns,
                                airplanes, tanks, etc.</p>

                                countries in so far as it might affect the Military Situation and
                                render such assistance as might aid the other branches and
                                Committees in their appreciations. A weekly appreciation was
                                prepared both from the Allied and Enemy point of view.</p>

                            <p>The French Section was divided into a Western Committee, an Eastern
                                Committee, a Committee on Economic and Political Affairs, and a
                                Secretariat and Administrative branch. It consisted of approximately
                                half the number of officers and clerks and enlisted men in the
                                British Section.</p>
                            <p>The Western Committee kept all information concerning affairs on the
                                Western front and was supposed to be prepared at all times to make
                                an estimate of probable developments on that front. The Eastern
                                Committee had similar duties in regard to the Eastern fronts from
                                Archangel to Egypt. The Economical and Political Committee was
                                chiefly concerned with the collection and digestion of information
                                relative to the state of public opinion and the financial conditions
                                of the enemy countries and of the small powers. The duties of the
                                Secretariat and Administrative Branch were the same as in the other
                                sections.</p>

                                16 enlisted men, and 2 civilian employees. It was the last section

                                available made it impossible to produce any extensive statistical
                                statements, the information in regard to the other Allied armies
                                being readily obtainable from the reports of the other sections and

                                        the American Section enjoyed for tact in dealing with its
                                        colleagues, for soundness of judgment, for—in short—general
                                        “level-headedness”, is due to the professional
                                        accomplishments, the loyal devotion to their work and the
                                        untiring zeal of these officers. More than one of them
                                        sacrificed uncomplainingly the promotion that I am sure
                                        would have come to them in field service. They sacrificed
                                        these chances in order to put all their energy into the work
                                        which the American Section was doing in furthering the great
                                        object for which the Supreme War Council was created,—to
                                        bring about harmony and cordiality in the relations and
                                        purposes of the Allies.</p>

                            <p>In his criticism of the proposed Supreme War Council made in his
                                speech in the House of Commons on the 19th of November, 1917, and
                                which was a covert attack representing the extreme nationalistic as
                                opposed to the rational inter-nationalistic view, Mr. Asquith called
                                attention to the fact that, while a body of military advisers was
                                provided for the Supreme War Council, naval interests, which were
                                particularly important to Great Britain, were not represented. This
                                objection was met by the formation in London of the Inter-Allied
                                Naval Council, on which Admiral Sims represented the United States.
                                Since the approval of the heads of the Allied Governments was
                                necessary to insure the execution of any action recommended by this
                                Council it frequently referred questions to the Supreme War Council,
                                and its relations to the latter gradually became similar, as
                                concerned naval affairs, to the relations of the Military
                                Representatives, as concerned military affairs. In order to insure
                                close and cordial cooperation between the Inter-Allied Naval Council
                                in London and the Military Representatives a naval liaison committee
                                was formed which periodically met at Versailles and facilitated the
                                interchange of views.</p>

                                Council at its Third Session, February 1st, 1918, the Military
                                Representatives made the following recommendations:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote"><p>“The Military Representatives consider that
                                    the question of placing Inter-Allied aviation on a definitely
                                    co-ordinated basis is a matter of great urgency. With this
                                    object they recommend that a small, strong Inter-Allied expert
                                    committee should be formed to report to the Supreme War Council.
                                    The Committee should meet at regular and frequent intervals at
                                    Versailles or wherever may be convenient. Each Section of the
                                    Supreme War Council should have upon its permanent staff an
                                    officer who should be an ex-officio member of that Committee.
                                    The Committee would, as a first step, draw up a statement of the

                                    the questions in need of most urgent consideration are:— <list>

                            <p>In the course of the three meetings of this committee views were
                                exchanged on many subjects of technical and general interest with
                                regard to the development of aviation. Special efforts were made to
                                co-ordinate the programs of production of aviation matériel. In
                                connection with the utilization of airplanes for counter-submarine
                                work it was decided that this service could not be separated from
                                the elements of the various navies charged with other anti-submarine
                                activities.</p>
                            <p>In the spring of 1918 the question of obtaining ground for the
                                airdromes of the various armies in France had become quite acute.
                                This committee was able to effect a compromise in this matter
                                satisfactory to all three armies and which would provide for the
                                increasing needs of the American aviation as well as for the new
                                airdromes that would be needed with any marked changes in the line
                                occupied by the contending armies.</p>
                            <p>The Committee interested itself especially in the formation of an
                                independent bombing force and in the designation of priority among
                                various military objectives as targets for such a force. This
                                discussion finally took form in Joint Note No. 35 of the Military

                                        night attacks on defenseless towns and advised that the

                            <p>The captures of rolling stock made by the Germans in the early years
                                of the war, the unusual wear and tear on the rolling stock
                                remaining, and the small facilities that could be devoted to the
                                repair of old and to the manufacture of new rolling stock had
                                resulted in a very marked reduction in the railroad facilities of
                                the Allied countries. Moreover, the movement of the French and
                                English divisions to Italy in the autumn of 1917 had brought such a
                                strain on the available matériel that it interfered with the regular
                                transportation in other places. This alone would have justified a
                                careful study of rolling stock and other matériel on hand with
                                reference to its best utilization, and such a study was made
                                absolutely necessary by the possibility of having again to reinforce

                                    officer who should be an ex-officio member of that committee.
                                    The Committee would, as a first step, draw up a statement of the
                                    existing position of affairs, the projects now under way, the

                            <p>It was foreseen that the collapse of Russia and Roumania would
                                liberate a large number of German divisions, which up to that time
                                had been needed for the campaigns on the Eastern front. The number
                                of divisions that would become available in this way for a German
                                offensive on the Western front in the spring of 1918 was variously
                                estimated at from forty to fifty. If thus utilized, they would
                                transfer the numerical superiority on the Western front from the
                                Allies to the Germans until such time as the American army in France
                                could be sufficiently organized and trained, and in sufficient
                                numbers, to reestablish the equilibrium or bring about Allied
                                superiority. Since weather conditions would probably prevent active
                                operations on the Italian front until late in the spring it also
                                seemed probable that the German forces which had been engaged in the
                                autumn in the drive against the Italian army would be withdrawn <pb

                            <p>The Allied reserves had already been depleted in October, 1917, by 6
                                French and 5 English divisions, sent to reinforce the Italian army
                                after the Caporetto disaster. It was evident that the maintenance of
                                a separate reserve, for each national army of sufficient strength to
                                make the position of that army perfectly safe, in case the great
                                German offensive should happen to strike its line, would be
                                impossible and that some plan for mutual support, as had already
                                been necessary in the case of Italy, was imperatively demanded by
                                the certainty that the German command would try to profit by their
                                temporary numerical superiority to get a decision before the United
                                States should have been able to develop her full military
                                strength.</p>
                            <p>With these facts before them the Military Representatives recommended
                                in paragraph 1 (i) of Joint Note No. 1 (December 13, 1917) “the use

                                the maximum mobile reserve”; and in Joint Note No. 14 (January 25,
                                1918) they made the following recommendation:</p>

                                <p>“The Military Representatives are of the opinion that the
                                    formation of a general reserve for the whole of the Allied
                                    forces on the Western front, both in France and Italy, is
                                    imperative.</p>
                                <p>“The Military Representatives recommend that in view of its
                                    urgency the creation of this reserve should be decided at the
                                    next meeting of the Supreme War Council and, so as to prepare
                                    for this decision, the governments should inform the Military
                                    Representatives as soon as possible of the views of their Chiefs
                                    of Staff and Commanders-in-Chief on this subject, in particular
                                    with regard to the number, situation and command of this

                            <p>The formation of such a general reserve was taken up at the Third
                                Session of the Supreme War Council, held at Versailles January 30th
                                to February 2nd. While the general principle met with almost
                                immediate approval, considerable discussion arose as to what units
                                should compose it and who should control or command it. It was
                                evident that the divisions needed for the creation of such a force
                                would have to be taken from the reserves then available behind the
                                different national armies—in other words, would have to be taken
                                away to some extent from the control of the various
                                commanders-in-chief—and that the individual or body controlling this
                                reserve and authorized to decide the time and place of its use would
                                exercise most of the essential powers of a commander-in-chief. It
                                was these facts which caused <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0299"
                                />most of the difficulty in securing the approval of all the
                                commanders-in-chief to the details of a plan which, in theory, they
                                approved.</p>
                            <p>Only the Supreme War Council itself had, at that time, authority to
                                do this and it might not be able to convene quickly enough to meet
                                an emergency. Some new agency had to be created and the Allies were
                                not yet prepared for the selection of a Commander-in-Chief. On
                                February 1st it was agreed that each member of the Supreme War
                                Council should discuss the subject with his own military advisers
                                and present his views at the meeting on the next day. This decision
                                was arrived at after much discussion and difference of opinion as to
                                the agency for the control of the General Reserve. Had they been
                                then ready to designate an Interallied Commander-in-Chief there
                                would have been no difficulty; but for this they were not yet ready.
                                The report made by the American Military Representative contained
                                the following:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote"><p>“1. I think that one single general
                                    principle should guide the Supreme War Council in determining
                                    the important question of the control and direction of the
                                    Interallied General Reserve. That general principle is unity of
                                    control and direction so far as it is possible to attain it.</p>
                                <p>“2. The Supreme War Council has already laid down the rule that
                                    the Allied Generals-in-Chief and their General Staffs must make
                                    their detailed plans in conformity to the general plans adopted
                                    by the Supreme War Council in representation of the Allied
                                    Governments. These plans must be submitted to the Supreme War
                                    Council in order that it may be assured that they are properly
                                    co-ordinated, and that all tend harmoniously to the successful
                                    accomplishment of a common object. The Supreme War Council
                                    cannot depart from this rule without abdicating its essential
                                    functions.</p>
                                <p>“3. It is not wise to waste effort by doing a thing which it is
                                    not necessary to do. It is, therefore, not wise to create an
                                    organization to do that which another organization has already
                                    been created to do. It is not wise to superimpose one agency
                                    upon another agency doing the same thing. The only possible
                                    result of such action will be to produce unnecessary confusion,
                                    friction, and delay, at a time when there should exist the
                                    utmost clearness of cool and unbiased vision, the utmost
                                    harmony, and the utmost rapidity of action.</p>
                                <p>“4. The Supreme War Council was created in order to secure unity
                                    of control, and unity of action. It was created, not to assume
                                    the functions of command and of execution which belong to
                                    Commanders-in-Chief and the General Staffs of the National
                                    Armies in the field, but it was created in order that a certain
                                    general control of the common allied military efforts might be
                                    transferred from the local theatres of war at the immediate
                                    front, where that control could not be exercised in the light of
                                    a general view of the entire situation, to a point further
                                    removed from that front and from which the situation on all
                                    fronts could be seen with equal clearness and each local
                                    situation be thus brought into its proper perspective.</p>
                                <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0300"/>
                                <p>“5. If the Supreme War Council, through its own military agency
                                    and in harmonious co-operation with the Commanders-in-Chief and
                                    with the General Staffs, is not able to undertake the solution
                                    of all questions relating to the Inter-Allied General Reserve,
                                    including its control and direction, I do not know of any
                                    organization which can undertake it. If the agency created to
                                    assist it under its immediate direction is not competent for the
                                    purpose, let the Supreme War Council change this agency to
                                    whatever extent it may find desirable; but, whatever be the
                                    final constitution of this agency, it is neither necessary nor
                                    wise to superimpose another agency on it. If the Supreme War
                                    Council cannot itself solve the problem of a general reserve, it
                                    will have failed in the principal function which, as I believe,
                                    it was created to perform, viz., the securing of unity of
                                    control and action; because, in the approaching campaign, the
                                    control and direction of a strong General Reserve is the only
                                    thing that will secure unity of purpose over three theatres of
                                    war which are now to be regarded as a single theatre.</p>
                                <p>“6. The Supreme War Council has already directed that the general
                                    attitude on the Western front shall, in general, be a defensive
                                    attitude. Therefore, the primary object in the creation of an
                                    Inter-Allied General Reserve must be the preservation of the
                                    integrity of a defensive line at the point or points most
                                    seriously threatened. It cannot be supposed that those who
                                    control and direct the reserve will use it to precipitate an
                                    offensive contrary to the accepted general plan. They can only
                                    direct it, in its entirety or in part, towards the threatened
                                    point where it immediately falls under the sole command of the
                                    Commander-in-Chief of that part of the front. If, when the enemy
                                    has been decisively repulsed, there should appear an opportunity
                                    for a decided offensive, it must be assumed that, if there then
                                    be any considerable force of the reserve still unengaged, those
                                    who control it will immediately send it to the
                                    Commander-in-Chief who is in a position to make the
                                    offensive.</p>
                                <p>“I, therefore, propose for consideration by the Supreme War
                                    Council the following—</p>
                                <p rend="center">Draft of a Resolution</p>
                                <p>“1. In order to secure unity of control and the maximum effort at
                                    the point or points of the Western front that may be most
                                    seriously attacked, the Supreme War Council directs the
                                    formation of an Interallied General Reserve.</p>
                                <p>“2. Its Military advisers, after full conference with the
                                    Commanders-in-Chief, their Chiefs of Staff, and the Chiefs of

                                            English and French fronts. To meet this attack I have
                                            already disposed of all the troops at present under my
                                            command, and if I were to earmark six or seven divisions
                                            from these troops, the whole of my plans and
                                            dispositions would have to be re-modelled. This is
                                            clearly impossible, and I therefore regret that I am
                                            unable to comply with the suggestion conveyed in the

                                            foreshadowed in the Joint Note.</p>

                                            front, it might be necessary to despatch a considerable
                                            force to the assistance of the Army attacked, and to
                                            maintain that force by a rotation of divisions. But this
                                            force could not be earmarked or located in any

                                            offensive or the development of the enemy’s intentions,
                                            for the situation might well demand the ultimate

                                Board was probably influenced by the vague fear which still existed
                                in the minds of some that the divisions “ear-marked” for the General
                                Reserve might be entirely withdrawn from the particular national
                                army to which they belonged and attached somewhere beyond the
                                control of the Commander-in-Chief of that Army; although to explain
                                that there was no intention of doing this was one of the objects of
                                the conference between the British Military Representative and the

                                General Reserve, taken from any national army, somewhere in rear of
                                the sector occupied by that army where it seemed, in view of the
                                general situation, that they would be most usefully employed in case
                                of a German attack against that sector, but also where they could be
                                moved with the greatest rapidity to reinforce the division of the
                                General Reserve taken from another army in case the attack should
                                develop against the sector occupied by that army. As stated below,
                                the divisions of the British army proposed to be taken for the
                                General Reserve would have been stationed at Amiens and its
                                immediate vicinity, and the corresponding French divisions were to
                                be at a point between Paris and Rheims. Could this disposition have
                                been made, there would have been approximately a quarter of a
                                million troops available and quickly ready to check the disastrous
                                German drive of March 21st.</p>
                            <p>The British Command had arranged with the French Command for mutual
                                assistance to be given, according as the attack should develop
                                against the British or against the French. But, it had been pointed
                                out at the Third Session of the Supreme War Council at Versailles,
                                January 30–February 2, that the whole purpose in view <pb n="259"
                                    xml:id="pg_259" facs="0305"/>was “that a certain general control
                                of the common allied military efforts might be transferred from the
                                local theatres of war at the immediate front, where that control
                                could not be exercised in the light of a general view of the entire
                                situation, to a point further removed from that front and from which
                                the situation on all fronts could be seen with equal clearness and
                                each local situation be thus brought into its proper perspective.”
                                Nothing could accomplish this except absolute unity of control of
                                the General Reserve. Very often it appeared that an attack proceeded
                                for a considerable time before it became evident that it was the
                                real main attack of the enemy. Subordinate attacks or deceptive
                                preparations for such attacks were made at other points or other
                                sectors. Each national commander naturally held on to his own troops
                                to the last minute believing that the real attack would ultimately
                                develop against him and that the one being made against his
                                colleagues was merely a subordinate one. These commanders were
                                necessarily tied up and influenced by an intense preoccupation with
                                the situation on their own front. And, it was only the immediate and
                                startling success of the Germans, beginning with March 21, which
                                left no room for doubt where the main attack was being made. It was
                                then only that French divisions were rushed in to fill the
                                breach,—rushed so hastily that they arrived on the field without
                                their artillery and reserve of ammunition. Had the recommendations
                                of the Executive War Board been carried into effect, the General
                                Reserve would have been ready at the locations best suited for their
                                prompt use, and just where the whole Entente world would have liked
                                to have them.</p>
                            <p>The statement of the British Command that arrangements had been made
                                for mutual assistance by the French and British was an
                                acknowledgment of the necessity of the General Reserve; but the
                                arrangement which they made lost most of the advantages of a General
                                Reserve. And the statement of that Command that the divisions of the
                                General Reserve “could not be located in any particular areas prior
                                to the delivery of the German offensive or the development of the
                                enemy’s intentions” is shown to be in error by the fact that the
                                proposed location of the divisions of that Reserve was one to meet
                                all of the requirements of the situation.</p>

                                offensive in March developed the fact that a part of the British

                                the work which fell upon the Supreme War Council and the method
                                pursued in performing it. In further illustration of this, a brief
                                account of the relations of the Supreme War Council to the conduct
                                of the war on the different fronts is given.</p>
                            <p>In a study presented to the Supreme War Council by the Military
                                Representatives, at the request of that Council, it was held that
                                France and Italy still remained the main theatres of the war. The
                                decisive victory of the war—provided the enemy powers continued to
                                hold together—was to be obtained by the decisive defeat of the
                                Germans on the Western front, and this defeat at any point would
                                necessarily entail the total collapse of enemy resistance on the
                                remainder of that front and in all other theatres of war. It was, of
                                course, always possible that a successful offensive on the Italian
                                front or in the Balkans might cause the enemy coalition to crumble
                                before a defeat could be inflicted on the French front; but in the
                                general conditions which then existed there was nothing whatever to
                                indicate this except as a remote possibility.</p>
                            <p>Nor was there anything at that time to make at all sure that the
                                crushing of Austrian resistance on the Italian, or Turkish
                                resistance on the Mesopotamian front would also crush Germany which
                                was the real foundation of the hostile coalition. It was true that
                                had the main effort, at one time, been diverted to the Italian front
                                not only might Austria be thrown out of the coalition, but success
                                there might afford an opportunity for a fatal thrust on the southern
                                flank of Germany. But, with the disaster of Caporetto it seemed that
                                this opportunity had been finally lost. It was, therefore, believed
                                that the decisive defeat of the enemy coalition could only be
                                achieved somewhere on the Western front between the North Sea and
                                Switzerland; and that for this final struggle the Allies must
                                concentrate their resources in man power and matériel on that front.
                                Nothing should be allowed to absorb resources which were required by
                                the armies of the Entente in France. It was assumed that the defeat
                                of the Central Powers in any of the subsidiary theatres of war could
                                only be a step on the road to the defeat of Germany; it could not
                                bring about the final decision. Therefore, the part to be played by
                                operations in the other theatres was assumed to be mainly that of
                                contributing to the moral and material exhaustion of the enemy,
                                thereby making his decisive defeat on the Western front the more
                                easy. Until the time came for the final thrust on all fronts it was
                                not realized how completely the military resistance of the enemy,
                                after his exhaustion by <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0310"/>the
                                determined Allied offensive of the summer and early autumn of 1918,
                                had become like that of an empty eggshell. It was, however, assumed
                                that as soon as the time came for final offensive operations in
                                France, the operations in Italy and in every other theatre of war
                                must be characterized by the utmost vigor in order to take advantage
                                of any specially favorable development in any of those theatres and
                                also to prevent the German armies in France from obtaining any
                                assistance from their allies elsewhere.</p>

                                1918 was first reached by the Allies when the Supreme War Council,

                                Representatives of December 13, 1917. It was based on a deliberate
                                and express acceptance of the view that the arrival of American
                                troops was necessary, first, to hold out against the anticipated
                                German attack and, second, to be able thereafter to take a decisive

                            <p>The foregoing marked the beginning of a co-ordinated Allied policy.
                                On the 31st of January, 1918, the Supreme War Council accepted Joint
                                Note No. 12, January 21st, 1918, of the Military Representatives,
                                which outlined the military policy for the beginning of 1918 and
                                until the circumstances of the campaign should indicate a change.
                                Again, in this note, a defensive policy for the Western front was
                                advised and while it was not thought at that time that even with the
                                maximum effort assumed as then possible for the United States in man
                                power and matériel a complete victory over the <pb n="265"
                                    xml:id="pg_265" facs="0311"/>Central Powers could be obtained in
                                1918, it was realized that unforeseen developments in that year
                                might afford an opportunity for final success. Therefore, the
                                Military Representatives advised that the Allied Armies on the
                                Western front, far from being passive should, on the contrary, take
                                advantage of every occasion to impose their will on the adversary.
                                It was held that “the policy of a strong defensive not only does not
                                preclude, but actually prepares for any offensive measures in any
                                theatre of war that may be decided upon for 1918 when the present
                                political situation in Russia, and the military situation in Italy,
                                are more clearly defined”. In the note the Military Representatives,
                                while advising energetic offensive action in Palestine and
                                Mesopotamia, maintained that no troops, excepting possibly surplus
                                mounted troops, could be with any degree of safety moved from the
                                Western to the Eastern front. The principle of treating the Western
                                front in France as a single strategic field of action, also agreed
                                upon at the meeting of the Supreme War Council of January 21, 1918,
                                now brought up the question of how the separate Allied Armies could
                                operate successfully under three separate, independent commanders.
                                The introduction to this report deals at length with this subject
                                and shows how matters progressed and necessity finally forced the
                                acceptance of a single commander for the Western front in
                                France.</p>

                            <p>In order that there may be no confusion as to the term “Western
                                Front” it must be remembered that, prior to the German offensives of
                                March and April, 1918, the term “Western Front” applied to the
                                sector from the North Sea to Switzerland; but, during the remaining
                                period of the war it applied to a sector which really included two
                                theatres of operation, namely, the sector from the North Sea to the
                                Adriatic. The term, therefore, required some qualification. As a
                                result of the Abbeville Agreement of the Supreme War Council in its
                                meeting at that place, May 2nd, 1918, the Western front became
                                officially the sector from the North Sea to the Adriatic and
                                subsequently in referring to the Western front the term was
                                qualified by “in France” or “in Italy” when mentioning one of the
                                divisions of what was considered one strategic field. <list>

                            <p>The attitude of the Supreme War Council, with respect to operations
                                on this front was to hold here only sufficient troops to maintain a
                                safe defensive attitude. The question of reinforcements for the
                                Italian front first came before the Military Representatives in
                                December of 1917, when Italy made an urgent request for a sixth
                                British division then on the Western front in France. The question
                                being referred to the Military Representatives, they prepared Joint
                                Note No. 3, which was accepted by the Supreme War Council February
                                1, 1918. This note advised against sending further reinforcements to
                                the Italian front.</p>
                            <p>On December 1st, 1917, the Supreme War Council instructed the
                                Military Representatives to examine the situation on the Italian
                                front from an offensive as well as a defensive point of view and
                                report upon it at an early date. As the result of this mandate the
                                Military Representatives prepared Joint Note No. 6, which was
                                accepted by the Supreme War Council at its session of February 1st,
                                1918. In this note the Military Representatives expressed the
                                following opinion:<quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“1. The situation appears to be restored on the Italian
                                        front. During the last six weeks the Italian Army has shown
                                        very considerable powers of resistance which ought to be
                                        sufficient to hold, with the help of the Allied forces, the
                                        line Piave-Grappa-Altiplani.</p>
                                    <p>“2. It does not at the present moment appear possible, or
                                        desirable, to take the offensive in Italy. The duty of the
                                        Allied forces is to maintain a defensive of the utmost
                                        tenacity with the object of preserving the line which they
                                        now occupy and which protects the port of Venice. With this
                                        object the line must be strengthened with every engineering
                                        device and with successive and mutually supporting lines
                                        behind it so that the ground can be defended inch by inch.
                                        As a measure of precaution, the works undertaken behind the
                                        Bachiglione and on the Mincio-Po line must be hurried on
                                        without delay.</p>
                                    <p>“3. The Allied reinforcements are sufficient in the existing

                                divisions, among which were four Italian divisions, were taken from
                                the Italian front and sent to the front in France.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">3. Operations in the Balkan Peninsula</hi>.</p>
                            <p>In Joint Note No. 1 of December 13, 1917, the Military
                                Representatives advised a defensive attitude in the Balkans. The
                                note stated that in the event of a serious attack by the enemy in
                                this theatre, in which it might be impossible to adequately
                                reinforce troops there available, it was necessary to consider the
                                possibility of a systematic and pre-arranged retirement from part,
                                at any rate, of the existing front.</p>
                            <p>In explanation of this general view, it must be kept in mind that the
                                Germans had already begun the withdrawal on a large scale of their
                                forces on the Russian front. Exactly what they were doing with them,
                                or intended to do, was not known. From time to time a new German
                                division was identified on the Western front in France. But whether
                                these represented all the divisions that had been withdrawn from the
                                East no one could tell. Others might at that moment be en route
                                towards the Balkans or Italy or towards both. Their arrival would be
                                known only when they suddenly appeared and, probably, only when they
                                appeared in a drive actually begun. The means of detection of newly
                                arrived enemy troops on either of those fronts were by no means as
                                easy as on the Western front. Not in-frequently, reports came to us
                                at Versailles of the arrival of fresh German divisions in Italy,
                                which afterwards proved incorrect. Moreover, the movement from the
                                East towards France might easily continue until the Germans had
                                there obtained a formidable superiority and still leave divisions to
                                throw against the Army of the Orient or against the Italian front.
                                And there were some who believed, then and now, that this would have
                                been a wiser move for the Germans to make, provided their
                                transportation facilities permitted it. The morale on neither of the
                                (for the time) subsidiary fronts was very good. Some believed that a
                                few good German divisions thrown without warning against the front
                                in Macedonia would break it. The political situation in Greece was
                                such that this might throw her out of the war, make many fine
                                harbors available as German submarine bases—all with a tremendous
                                reflex action on the Allied morale. Similar action might break the
                                Italian front with similar results. The Italians themselves believed
                                this to be the real danger, <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0314"
                                />which accounted for their unwillingness to send a large force to
                                France and on the contrary caused them to demand reinforcements.
                                Therefore, for the time, it seemed that the most that could be done
                                on these two fronts was to strengthen the positions and hold on.</p>
                            <p>In Joint Note No. 4, of December 23, 1917, approved by the Supreme
                                War Council on June 3, 1918, the Military Representatives
                                recommended the holding of a line from Stavros to Monastir for which
                                purpose they stated that they believed sufficient allied forces were
                                on the ground to successfully withstand the enemy forces then
                                present in that theatre. They advised, however, that since
                                reinforcements for the Balkans were not available the possibility of
                                a retirement must be faced. While recognizing the desirability of
                                holding on to both Salonika and Valona they urged that the mainland
                                of Greece be denied to the enemy. It was requested that the
                                Commander-in-Chief at Salonika be asked for his plan and that he be
                                advised that it must include arrangements for rebasing himself on
                                Greece and not on Salonika alone.</p>
                            <p>As a result of the enemy pressure still being exerted in France, the
                                Supreme War Council at its 5th Session agreed that a French and
                                British general officer should be sent at once to Salonika, where,
                                in association with the general officer commanding the Italian
                                forces at Valona they should confer with General Guillaumat in
                                order, if possible, to arrange for the immediate withdrawal of some
                                Allied battalions from that theatre to the Western front. No
                                withdrawals resulted, however, from the foregoing action.</p>

                                of the uncertain political conditions in which some of the Allies’
                                enemies were then involved, and that, therefore, the

                                preparing his offensive operations, lose sight of the necessity
                                which still existed of improving his lines of communications and of
                                establishing new bases in Old Greece in accordance with the

                            <p>At the close of the year 1917 and beginning of the year 1918 the
                                Allies watched day by day the Germans withdrawing an increasing
                                number of divisions from their Russian front and adding them to the
                                forces which it was evident that they intended to employ in a
                                tremendous effort early in the latter year. The situation was such
                                as to cause the Allies the gravest apprehension. They were ready to
                                clutch at every straw which seemed to afford the slightest chance of
                                supporting their sinking weight.</p>
                            <p>In the month of February, 1918, the American Military Representative
                                was informed that one of the Allies was strongly pressing the
                                Government of the United States to participate in an Allied
                                expedition to Siberia by way of Vladivostock. It was his first
                                definite information that such a project was being considered,
                                although for some time it had been a matter of more or less informal
                                discussion among his colleagues. On receiving this information he
                                brought the matter up for formal discussion with his colleagues and
                                then learned that more or less elaborate, though unofficial, studies
                                had been made on the subject.</p>
                            <p>It was represented that enormous stores of military supplies of all
                                kinds had been brought to Vladivostock during the régime of the Czar
                                and that the general collapse of the transportation system, both
                                before and after the revolution, had prevented their being brought
                                    <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0316"/>into European Russia.
                                There was reason to believe that the new government might dispose of
                                these stores to the advantage of Germany and to the detriment of the
                                Allies. It was believed that great quantities of them were still to
                                be found at Vladivostock and along the railway at least as far as
                                Harbin.</p>
                            <p>This situation gave a valid reason for the military occupation of
                                Vladivostock and the railway as far as Harbin, as a similar one gave
                                a military reason for the subsequent project to occupy the ports of
                                Murmansk and Archangel. But, as far as these situations alone were
                                concerned, neither of them gave a reason for a further advance into
                                the interior.</p>
                            <p>With reference to Siberia, the studies showed that no other Allied
                                troops than those of Japan (except, possibly, in very small numbers)
                                could be made available for this expedition. In fact, it was urged
                                that one advantage of this movement would be to utilize Japanese
                                troops relatively near to their home base but who could not be
                                brought to any of the other fronts without a cost in money and
                                tonnage, combined with difficulties of supply, that would be
                                prohibitive.</p>
                            <p>At that time there was, in the mind of many, a misconception as to
                                the extent of the revolutionary feeling in Russia, whether Bolshevik
                                or otherwise, and the American Military Representative always held
                                that the plans for intervention in that country and the ultimate
                                objects were too largely based on that misconception. The others
                                believed that the great mass of the people in European Russia and,
                                especially, in Siberia wanted nothing but a leader and some support
                                from the outside to overthrow a government whose local iniquities
                                were then beginning to appall the world. Too little weight was given
                                to the fact that the great mass of the 180,000,000 people living in
                                Russia knew little of these iniquities and suffered little or
                                nothing from them; while they attributed all of the evils from which
                                they suffered to war in the abstract. People who believed that were
                                not likely to rally to the support of anyone who proposed further
                                war.</p>
                            <p>Whether the basic idea was incorrect or not, it was assumed that,
                                after getting possession of the military stores at Vladivostock and
                                Archangel, an Allied force of only a few divisions could work its
                                way along the trans-Siberian railway as far as Cheliabinsk,
                                occupying the important centers of population on or near that
                                railway, and thus furnishing nuclei about which the orderly elements
                                would rally and thence, by a process of peaceful penetration, their
                                influence would be carried into European Russia. The occupation of
                                the Siberian railway, it was believed, would first of all deprive
                                the Germans of any possible hope of the grain supply of that great
                                province. Furthermore, it was believed that the influence permeating
                                    <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0317"/>the rest of the empire
                                from the restoration of orderly government in Siberia would lead to
                                a rehabilitation of a Russian Army to operate on the Eastern
                                frontier of Germany. Could this be realized in time, it would
                                prevent the further withdrawal of German divisions from that front
                                and might possibly force the return of some that had already been
                                withdrawn.</p>
                            <p>Thus, it will be seen that the original idea was not primarily to
                                initiate a war against Bolshevism as such but was merely to bring
                                about a renewal of a Russian thrust against Eastern Germany.</p>
                            <p>In the discussions which followed upon this subject, the American
                                Military Representative held that the only certain or probable
                                military advantage from the proposed movement would result from
                                taking possession of the military supplies at Vladivostock and
                                Harbin and prevent their sale to the Germans. He believed that, as
                                conditions then were, the proposed movement along the entire line of
                                the trans-Siberian railway was open to serious objections and might
                                result in a situation quite the opposite to that which academic
                                studies had made appear possible or probable. The Germans had at
                                that moment just renewed the status of war with the Bolsheviks. The
                                real object of the proposed movement was to consolidate all of the
                                anti-Bolshevik forces in Russia in favor of the Allies; but it was
                                proposed that the movement should be conducted almost entirely by
                                Japanese troops, the long-time enemies of the Russians and towards
                                whom the latter entertained a very bitter feeling. It was,
                                therefore, necessary to consider whether the Germans as the declared
                                enemies of the Bolsheviks might not be as likely to consolidate in
                                their own favor the anti-Bolshevik sentiment as the Japanese would
                                be to consolidate it in favor of the Allies. Moreover, the proposed
                                movement would demand an increasing number of troops, especially
                                should the original assumption as to the friendly attitude of the
                                Russian masses prove to be erroneous. This increasing demand would
                                cause an increasing drain on tonnage which, even without the losses
                                due to submarine warfare, was not sufficient for the proper conduct
                                of the war on the Western front. He, personally, believed that the
                                war would be decided in 1918 for or against the Allies. It would
                                take a long time, even if all calculations and assumptions proved
                                correct, to bring any real Allied pressure to bear on Germany
                                through Russia. Long before the lapse of this time the war might be
                                over and might be lost due to this diversion of Allied strength.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, he believed that the seizure of the military stores at
                                Vladivostock and Harbin would be a distinct advantage to the Allies
                                and as this could be accomplished by the use of a relatively small
                                Japanese force which could not be employed to advantage elsewhere
                                    <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0318"/>and which could be
                                handled by Japanese tonnage he yielded his objections to the extent
                                of agreeing to this occupation, with a further proviso that a strong
                                civilian and military Allied Mission should accompany the expedition
                                to Harbin, and which should report to the respective governments the
                                facts which they might then have ascertained in regard to the real
                                interior feeling of Russia, thus enabling those governments to
                                decide whether the continuance of the movement would or would not be
                                wise.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, on February 18, 1918, the Military Representatives
                                adopted their Joint Note No. 16, as follows:— <list>
                                    <item>“1. That the occupation of the Siberian railway from
                                        Vladivostock to Harbin, together with both terminals,
                                        presents military advantages that outweigh any probable
                                        political disadvantages.</item>
                                    <item>“2. That they recommend this occupation by a Japanese
                                        force, after obtaining a suitable guarantee from Japan;
                                        together with a joint Allied Mission.</item>
                                    <item>“3. The question of the further occupation of the railway
                                        shall be determined by the Allied Governments concerned
                                        according as the circumstances develop.”</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>By this time, however, the subject had been taken up by the
                                respective governments by diplomatic correspondence instead of being
                                a matter to be determined by the Supreme War Council, and nothing
                                further was done in the execution of Joint Note No. 16.</p>
                            <p>The views of the American Military Representative received the
                                approval of his Government.</p>
                            <p>However, on April 9, 1918, at a full meeting of the Military
                                Representatives, there was presented the draft of Joint Note No. 20
                                for discussion. The subject of this note was “The Situation in the
                                Eastern Theatre”. It emphasized the necessity of an immediate Allied
                                intervention in Russia as the only course that would insure any
                                “serious military resistance to Germany” from that direction. Here,
                                again, was an evidence of the frequent tendency to divert efforts
                                from measures to attain a common end, for the purpose of guarding
                                some threatened national interest. In Joint Note No. 20 appeared
                                very clearly the British fear of influences that might seriously
                                threaten India. To be sure, such a threat by the Central Powers
                                might cause the diversion of British troops from the Western front
                                in order to protect and guard the threatened India, and thereby
                                decide the war in favor of the enemy. But, surely, this was an
                                argument in favor of permitting no diversion of effort from the
                                Western front but rather of concentrating every effort there for the
                                purpose of effecting a quick decision.</p>
                            <p>I explained to my colleagues that the instructions which I had
                                received from my Government were to the effect that the whole
                                question of intervention in Siberia was the subject of diplomatic
                                    <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0319"/>negotiation; that I,
                                therefore, could not join them in signing the note but that, as it
                                was a clear exposition of the situation from their point of view, I
                                would transmit it, unsigned by me, for the information of my
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In any event, difficulties of finance practically prohibited
                                intervention in Siberia on the scale which finally came to be
                                demanded. Even if it were attempted by one of the Allies alone, that
                                Ally would have to be compensated or financed; and this could only
                                be done, either by granting concessions which were repugnant to the
                                underlying idea with which the United States had entered the war, or
                                by the United States assuming a financial burden which it could not
                                then bear. It could only do this by largely ceasing its effort on
                                the Western front.</p>

                                Expeditions.</p>
                            <p>At a joint meeting of the Inter-Allied Naval Council and the Military
                                Representatives of the Supreme War Council, March 23, 1918, the
                                question of intervention at the northern Russian ports, Archangel
                                and Murmansk, was first considered. The Joint Report prepared
                                contained the following views:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. Intervention at Archangel.</p>
                                <p>“From the military point of view, under existing conditions no
                                    military resources whatever are found to be available for an
                                    expedition to Archangel.</p>
                                <p>“From the naval point of view, it would be extremely difficult to
                                    withdraw naval material, either transports or men-of-war, to
                                    devote to this expedition. The loss of this shipping, assigned
                                    to Archangel, would be heavily felt both in anti-submarine
                                    warfare and in transportation.</p>
                                <p>“The Council is conscious of the importance of preventing the
                                    stores accumulated at this point from falling into the hands of
                                    the enemy and is of opinion that all possible steps must be
                                    taken to insure the destruction of these stores.</p>
                                <p>“2. Intervention at Murmansk.</p>
                                <p>“The same considerations are equally applicable to Murmansk so
                                    far as a military expedition specially directed to this point is
                                    concerned.</p>
                                <p>“The Council is however of opinion, so far as this last place is
                                    concerned, that the naval steps actually being taken should be
                                    continued in order to retain this place in the possession of the
                                    Allies as long as possible.”</p>

                            <p>However, as time went on, the threat of a German advance on Petrograd
                                and the ports of Murmansk and Archangel, assisted by Finnish troops
                                (that country having aspirations in the latter direction) came to be
                                more and more real. Therefore, on June 3, 1918, the Supreme War

                                        Murmansk would be continued in order to maintain Allied
                                        possession of that port as long as possible.</p>

                                        since the 23d of March the general situation in Russia and
                                        especially in the Northern Ports has completely altered. <list>

                                of Russia was perfectly clear. It recognized that, at the best, only
                                a limited force was available. It was not contemplated by it nor (so
                                far as was known to it) by any other government to conduct
                                operations into the interior of the country,—certainly not except
                                with the cordial consent of the Russian people. It agreed to the
                                occupation of the ports for the purpose of getting possession of
                                valuable military material and of preventing, as long as possible
                                with the available force, access by the Germans to them and the
                                establishment by them there of bases.</p>

                                President of the United States asking that there be dispatched to
                                the ports of Murmansk and Archangel an American force consisting of
                                three battalions of infantry and machine guns, two batteries of
                                field artillery, three companies of engineers and the necessary
                                administrative and medical service. This contribution was <pb
                                    n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0322"/>materially in excess of
                                that which had been originally contemplated to be made by the United
                                States. It led to requests from Washington for explanation and I
                                accordingly, on June 22, 1918, sent a cable to Washington bearing on
                                the general question of intervention at the Russian Arctic
                                ports.</p>
                            <p>In this cable, besides giving an estimate of the situation with
                                respect to the Russian Arctic ports, I expressed the opinion that
                                the ports of Murmansk and Archangel could not be retained by the
                                Allies without an unwise expenditure of military effort, unless the
                                larger part of the forces required were drawn from Czech units then
                                in Russia or from Russian sources; and further, that until definite
                                assurance was had that such assistance would be obtained, Allied
                                forces maintained at these ports should be sufficient only for
                                defense against small enemy operations, or in the event of major
                                enemy operations to insure removal or destruction of stores and
                                destruction insofar as practicable, of all port material that would
                                be of service to the enemy in the establishment of submarine bases;
                                that before entering on a new and vague plan calling for a large
                                increase in the originally proposed American force the plan must be
                                studied out and the common agreement of the Allies reached.</p>
                            <p>It will be remembered that a considerable force of Czech troops,
                                which had joined the Russian armies prior to the revolution and
                                which, subsequently to the revolution, had developed an increasing
                                repugnance to fighting for or against any of the then factions in
                                Russia, was gradually working its way toward the east in the hope
                                that on arrival at Vladivostock they might be transported by the
                                Allies to the Western front. At about this time, a part of this
                                force was in the vicinity of Omsk (and perhaps had passed beyond it
                                on its way to Vladivostock) while another part of it was farther to
                                the west. It was hoped that this latter force might be diverted to
                                the northwest and finally reach Archangel where it would join the
                                small force of Serbs and Czechs already there.</p>
                            <p>The discrepancy between the contribution proposed by Joint Note No.
                                31 and that which was actually requested by the British led to an
                                inquiry for explanation from Washington.</p>
                            <p>Military intervention at the northern ports of Russia was the subject
                                of long and earnest consideration at the session of the Supreme War
                                Council at Versailles July 2–4, 1918. At that session the American
                                Military Representative explained that, probably, one of the reasons
                                for failure thus far to take action by the Government at Washington
                                was due to this discrepancy between the figures originally proposed
                                and those which were finally demanded. It then became evident that
                                General Poole, commanding at Archangel, had telegraphed to the
                                British Government for additional forces with a <pb n="277"
                                    xml:id="pg_277" facs="0323"/>view to a more or less extended
                                intervention. It was this which led to the British request of our
                                Government for an apparently excessive contribution. After long
                                consideration the three Prime Ministers drew up and sent a telegram
                                to the President of the United States in regard to the intervention,
                                without asking for study and recommendation by the Military
                                Representatives.</p>
                            <p>In reply to requests for information I cabled on July 12, 1918, my
                                views substantially as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Murmansk and Archangel plan was a compromise. Prior to July 2,
                                when Sir Eric Geddes presented to the Supreme War Council the views
                                of the British General Poole, commanding at Murmansk, my attitude
                                toward this plan was as follows. My colleagues had steadily held to
                                the view that sooner or later there would be intervention in
                                Siberia. They believed that at any moment the attitude of Germany
                                towards Russia might become such that the United States would
                                approve of this intervention. I agreed with them to the extent that
                                should such intervention come it would be desirable for the Allies
                                to possess a point of support and access to Western Russia that
                                would embarrass the Germans in their efforts to check intervention
                                in Siberia and that would eventually permit military supplies to be
                                carried into Russia directly from the west as well as from the
                                east.</p>
                            <p>But I took no part in any plan based on the assumption of general
                                intervention. The occupation of the northern Russian ports as part
                                of a general plan of intervention would require a force large enough
                                to move south and control or threaten railway communications between
                                west and east.<note n="*" xml:id="d147fn45">As a matter of fact, a
                                    force sufficient for this purpose was never sent to North Russia
                                    and for this reason, among others, the expedition failed. T. H.
                                    B. [Footnote in the original.]</note> I did not believe that
                                this force could be sent in from the outside and kept supplied, but
                                would have to be raised from the country from friendly Russians. I
                                and my colleagues therefore agreed upon a small force of at most 6
                                and possibly only 4 battalions distributed among the four Allies
                                which, with the land and sea forces already there, we believed
                                sufficient to hold the northern ports during that winter. This plan
                                was strongly supported by General Foch and the Naval
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>Under that plan the United States would send one or, at most, two
                                battalions—probably marines. With this small contribution, we would,
                                first, get possession of the large amount of military stores still
                                held at Archangel and which would be of great value to the Germans
                                should it fall into their hands. Second, we would retain access to
                                Russia by way of Murmansk which was an ice-free port. From a
                                humanitarian point of view I thought that this was very important.
                                All reports indicated the approach of a severe famine in northern
                                    <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0324"/>Russia. It might be
                                necessary to send food, medicines and Red Cross assistance
                                generally. This might give opportunity for peaceful American
                                intervention of the greatest value to the orderly elements in Russia
                                and to the Allies. Third, there was an incidental military advantage
                                that would result from holding the northern ports in case, for any
                                reason, intervention should be agreed upon.<note n="*"
                                    xml:id="d147fn46">It must be kept in mind that at this time
                                    there was no certainty that intervention on a considerable scale
                                    would not be finally agreed upon. T. H. B. [Footnote in the
                                    original.]</note> It was assumed that this small force could
                                hold the ports until after the opening of the campaign of the
                                following year. By that time the question of general intervention
                                would certainly have been decided. Should that intervention have
                                come, it would have been a grave mistake to have surrendered the
                                northern ports if we could possibly hold them.</p>
                            <p>The American Government had expressed sympathy with practical
                                military efforts that could be made at and from Murmansk and
                                Archangel, provided that they proceeded on the full sympathy of the
                                Russian people and did not interfere with their political liberty.
                                Murmansk was already in possession of the Allies and Archangel
                                partially so. I assumed that no military movements from these places
                                to the south could be made if the Russians were not sympathetic. I
                                believed that the occupation of the Northern ports would be
                                “practical military efforts,” which would justify the small
                                expedition proposed and the risks involved. After further discussion
                                of the subject I concluded my cable with the statement that “on the
                                whole I think we should be represented but only by our fair
                                part”.</p>
                            <p>On July 23rd a Washington cable to the American Section of the
                                Supreme War Council stated that the President had decided to permit
                                3 battalions of infantry and 3 companies of engineers to participate
                                in the Murmansk Expedition. The infantry was to come from General
                                Pershing’s forces, provided General Foch could spare them, and
                                likewise the engineers, if General Pershing himself could spare
                                these. No artillery was authorized.</p>
                            <p>From time to time after the dispatch of the above force to Murmansk,
                                and in one way or another, efforts were made to convince me that I
                                should urge my government to further augment the forces in Northern
                                Russia. The expressed purpose for the increase in force urged was
                                offensive Allied action by the Northern Russian Expedition and I
                                consistently held to the view that the Murmansk and Archangel
                                Expeditions were intended for a specific defensive purpose, namely:
                                the retention of those ports and for that purpose should not be
                                augmented. Further I made it clear that the Government of the United
                                States had definitely declined to take part in organized
                                intervention in the interior of Russia in adequate force from
                                Murmansk or Archangel.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">5. Utilisation of American Troops</hi>.</p>
                            <p>From the time when the United States entered the war the Allied
                                authorities urged that the American man power be utilized to
                                maintain the Allied divisions at their maximum strength and in the
                                number then organized, the American recruits receiving their
                                finishing training in the schools already established and in
                                operation for the allied armies. Opinion as to just how this should
                                be done, ranged from the proposal to feed the American soldiers
                                individually into European units to that of assigning smaller
                                American units, such as companies or battalions, to the European
                                divisions. It was recognized by the American authorities that any
                                such procedure would be entirely impracticable and would not secure
                                the best utilization of American man power. It was very evident to
                                both General Pershing and myself that, in order for the American
                                effort to reach its full efficiency, the American Army concentrated
                                for a definite operation of its own on a well defined section of the
                                front must be organized at the earliest possible opportunity. The
                                Allies were very persistent in urging their proposition in some form
                                or other, claiming that the shipping obtainable would not be
                                sufficient to transport a well balanced army, with its complement of
                                heavy artillery and auxiliary and supply troops, in time to
                                participate in the 1918 campaign which it was foreseen would be the
                                critical period of the war for the Allies. They showed that their
                                man power reserves were exhausted and that the casualties, which
                                must be foreseen as the result of the anticipated German offensive,
                                would reduce their armies to such an extent that they could not hold
                                throughout the year the front then occupied. Thus they were
                                reasoning on two erroneous assumptions, to some extent justified by
                                their own experience, namely:<list>

                            <p>The case of the Allies was stated and discussed at the 3rd Session of
                                the Supreme War Council, January 31st, 1918, at Versailles. At the
                                conclusion of this discussion and in regard to the question which
                                had been twice asked by Baron Sonnino as to whether the American
                                Government would allow the minor units of each division to be
                                amalgamated with British and French divisions, in order that they
                                could most effectively perform their part in the emergency which was
                                assumed to be approaching within the next few months, I made in
                                substance the following statement:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“To ask the United States formally to declare now and in advance
                                    of the emergency that it will permit its units to be amalgamated
                                    with British and French divisions is to make unnecessarily
                                    difficult the solution of the problem which you are studying, i.
                                    e., the most effective utilization of American man-power under
                                    present conditions. Everything possible is now being done to
                                    prepare for this effective utilization of American man-power
                                    without the formal declaration by my Government which Baron
                                    Sonnino appears to desire. Yesterday the British Government
                                    agreed to bring over six American divisions, with the
                                    understanding that they would train the infantry battalions of
                                    these divisions on the British front. If the German attack finds
                                    these battalions on the British front they will fight to the
                                    extent of their capacity wherever the attack finds them. Also,
                                    General Pershing entered into an agreement with General Petain
                                    by which the organizations of his divisions will receive their
                                    final training on the French line. It goes without saying that
                                    neither can be withdrawn for the purpose of forming complete
                                    American divisions under their own officers while the German
                                    attack is being made or is being prepared. If the crisis should
                                    come the American troops will undoubtedly be used in whatever
                                    way their services will be most effective, either in defense or
                                    offence, with the British and French troops with whom they are
                                    at the time serving. It is to be clearly understood, however,
                                    that this training of American units with British and French
                                    divisions, whether behind the lines or in actual combat on the
                                    line, is only a stepping stone in the training of the American
                                    forces, and that whenever it is proper and practicable to do so
                                    these units will be formed into American divisions under their
                                    own officers. Such a thing as permanent amalgamation of our
                                    units with British and French units would be intolerable to
                                    American sentiment.”</p>

                            <p>The discussion ended there, and no further action was taken at this
                                session.</p>
                            <p>The losses occasioned by the German offensive of March, 1918,
                                amounted to approximately the combatant personnel of ten British
                                divisions and exhausted their reserves of men. To make good these
                                losses the Parliament passed a new conscription bill which drew into
                                the army younger and older men; but these could not be trained and
                                ready to take their share of the service until the latter part of
                                July or the beginning of August. A message was received by me from
                                the British Prime Minister in March, 1918, in which he stated the
                                predicament <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0327"/>in which the
                                English Government found itself and especially urged that the
                                American schedule of transportation be changed so as to increase the
                                number of combatant men (especially infantrymen and machine-gunners)
                                and correspondingly decrease the shipments of men of the other
                                services and of material.</p>
                            <p>The nature of the shipping available was such that the greatest
                                number of men could be transported in the least time by bringing
                                over first infantrymen and machine-gunners in their regular
                                organizations and leaving artillery personnel, guns, transportation
                                and auxiliary troops until later. These infantry brigades, if placed
                                in training with the British and French armies and concentrated in
                                rear of their lines, would constitute a considerable reserve force
                                which had already had many months training in the United States. It
                                was found that, if this were agreed to by the American authorities,
                                the British Government would feel itself justified by the emergency
                                in utilizing for their transportation shipping which up to that time
                                had been engaged in other very necessary traffic. The critical
                                situation on the front and the fact that this offer of additional
                                shipping from the British would actually expedite the getting of
                                American troops to Europe, seemed to justify a departure from the
                                priority list established for the American forces, and the Military
                                Representatives therefore adopted Joint Note No. 18, March 27, 1918,
                                which read as follows:<list>

                                        Representatives agreed as follows: ‘After the most careful
                                        and searching inquiry they were agreed on the point that the
                                        security of France could also be assured. But in view of the
                                        strength of the attack which the enemy is able to develop on
                                        this front, an attack which, in the opinion of the Military
                                        Representatives could reach a strength of 96 divisions
                                        (excluding reinforcements by “roulement”); they feel
                                        compelled to add that France will be safe during 1918 only
                                        under certain conditions, namely:<list>

                                                which American aid, in excess of what at one time
                                                seemed practicable, has been rendered to the Allies
                                                during the past month to meet a great emergency. The
                                                crisis, however, still continues. General Foch has
                                                presented to us a statement of the utmost gravity,
                                                which, points out that the numerical superiority of
                                                the enemy in France, where 162 Allied divisions are
                                                now opposed to 200 German divisions, is very heavy,
                                                and that, as there is no possibility of the British
                                                and French increasing the number of their divisions
                                                (on the contrary, they are put to extreme straits to
                                                keep them up), there is a great danger of the war
                                                being lost unless the numerical inferiority of the
                                                Allies can be remedied. He therefore urges with the
                                                utmost insistence that the maximum number of
                                                infantry and machine-gunners, in which respects the
                                                shortage of men on the side of the Allies is most
                                                marked, should continue to be shipped from America
                                                in the months of June and July to avert the
                                                immediate danger of an Allied defeat in the present
                                                campaign owing to the Allied reserves being
                                                exhausted before those of the enemy. In addition to
                                                this, and looking to the future, he represents that
                                                it is impossible to foresee ultimate victory in the
                                                war unless America is able to provide such an Army
                                                as will enable the Allies ultimately to establish
                                                numerical superiority. He placed the total American
                                                force required for this at no less than 100
                                                divisions, and urges the continuous raising of fresh
                                                American levies, which, in his opinion, should not
                                                be less than 300,000 a month, with a view to
                                                establishing a total American force of 100 divisions
                                                at as early a date as this can possibly be

                                <p>“The President has, therefore, transmitted his correspondence
                                    with the present German authorities to the Governments with
                                    which the Government of the United States is associated as a
                                    belligerent, with the suggestion that, if those governments are
                                    disposed to effect peace upon the terms and principles
                                    indicated, their military advisers and the military advisers of
                                    the United States be asked to submit to the governments
                                    associated against Germany the necessary terms of such an
                                    armistice as will fully protect the interests of the peoples
                                    involved and insure to the associated Governments the
                                    unrestricted <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0331"/>power to
                                    safeguard and enforce the details of the peace to which the
                                    German Government has agreed, provided they deem such an
                                    armistice possible from the military point of view. Should such
                                    terms of armistice be suggested, their acceptance by Germany
                                    will afford the best concrete evidence of her unequivocal
                                    acceptance of the terms and principles of peace from which the
                                    whole action proceeds.”</p>

                            <p>It is well to note the terms of these communications because of the
                                unwarranted opinion, which has been expressed by some, to the effect
                                that the Government of the United States forced the unwilling
                                acceptance of an armistice on the governments with which it was
                                associated in the war. The President’s letter of October 23, 1918,
                                plainly leaves the whole matter in the hands of the Allied
                                Governments. It was only on the condition that “those governments
                                are disposed to effect peace upon the terms and principles
                                indicated” that the question of an armistice at that time would be
                                considered at all. The American representatives who participated in
                                the drafting of the armistice terms were guided by the spirit of
                                this communication. They had no more to do with the formulation of
                                the terms of the armistice than the representatives of any of the
                                other participating powers, and more than once they yielded their
                                own view to a different but unanimous view of their colleagues.</p>
                            <p>There is always a tendency for us to judge preceding events in the
                                light of our subsequent knowledge. When the total collapse of
                                Germany became evident there were many who had advocated the
                                armistice as it was actually made but who then expressed wonder that
                                more drastic terms of surrender had hot been exacted. Twice there
                                had been presented to the authorities formulating the Armistice
                                terms the condition of absolute and complete disarmament and
                                demobilization of all land and naval forces of the enemy. It had
                                been rejected;—why? To those who were in daily association with the
                                political and military leaders then assembled in Paris the reason
                                was obvious.</p>
                            <p>In the early days of November, 1918, the extent to which the German
                                people was beaten was not known to the outside world. Those people
                                were wearing paper shoes, paper clothing, eating substitutes for
                                food that an American farmer would not feed to his cattle or pigs.
                                Yet, at that very time, legislators and economists of the Allied
                                world were talking of anti-dumping laws as being necessary to
                                protect their peoples against the commercial flood of manufactured
                                fabrics and articles of all kinds with which they believed German
                                ware-houses to be filled,—manufactured and stored during the
                                war!</p>
                            <p>As for the German army, it was apparently being beaten. But, before,
                                there was a time when it was apparently being beaten. For more than
                                two years, up to the early days of 1917 it had held a fortified <pb
                                    n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0332"/>line in France. It suffered
                                much in holding it, but it also inflicted tremendous losses on the
                                Allies who tried to drive it back. Then came the withdrawal to the
                                “Hindenburg line”. As the one side withdrew, the other pushed
                                eagerly on. Our newspapers and the Allied newspapers were filled day
                                by day with accounts—perfectly true accounts—of the capture of
                                thousands of prisoners here and there, of many hundreds of pieces of
                                artillery, and of great quantities of stores and ammunition. If one
                                were to consult a file of newspapers of those days he would find the
                                rapidly growing conviction that the Germans were hopelessly beaten.
                                Editorial comment and countless cartoons scouted and ridiculed the
                                idea that the Germans were making an orderly and successful
                                withdrawal to a new position where they were again to hold the
                                Allies at bay for many months and fill the graveyards of that fair
                                land with another million of Allied dead.</p>
                            <p>When armies of the huge size of this war confront each other on a
                                line hundreds of miles in length, with the advanced trenches along
                                this line within pistol shot of each other, neither side can get up
                                and withdraw in the course of a night and be at day-break beyond the
                                reach of its enemy. The new position must first be fortified by
                                weeks or months of labor; new artillery positions must be prepared
                                with concrete platforms for the heavy guns; hundreds of miles of
                                road must be repaired and others constructed. New stores of supplies
                                and dumps of ammunition must be accumulated on the new position.
                                Between the old and the new positions—a distance of many miles—every
                                point from which the advance of the enemy can be checked must be
                                fortified and held by its garrison till death or capture. On this
                                depends the safety of its main army. Every town and village from
                                which roads radiate must be held to the last; because, in these days
                                of tractor-drawn artillery, of motor ammunition and supply trains
                                and motor transportation for rapidly moving bodies of troops, the
                                roads are more than ever of vital importance. Large parts of the
                                stored supplies and of the ammunition dumps must be abandoned to the
                                enemy, if they cannot be destroyed in time. Transportation is not
                                available for them and reliance must be placed on new stores in the
                                new position. An ammunition dump may cover many square miles. For
                                miles the ground along the main roads leading to a position and the
                                lateral roads in rear of it are dotted with piles of projectiles of
                                every kind, covered with earth to protect them from air-plane attack
                                and from which the shells are dug out as a farmer digs out roots for
                                his cattle. Other piles are hidden far from the roads, in clumps of
                                trees and in forests where they are invisible to the eager searcher
                                in the air. Neither time nor means permit the removal of much of
                                such material or its destruction, and it swells the list of the
                                enemy’s booty of war.</p>

                            <p>It is all this which accounts for the Allies’ captures during the
                                successful German withdrawal of 1917.</p>
                            <p>Until the end comes such a movement is apparently quite consistent
                                with the belief either that an orderly but limited withdrawal is
                                being made or that the enemy has met with his final defeat and is
                                retreating to his own frontier and as much further as he may be
                                driven before his surrender. But we know well enough what has
                                happened when, suddenly, we read that our armies, which have been
                                advancing at the rate of fifteen or twenty or more kilometers a day,
                                and day after day, capturing many thousands of prisoners, hundreds
                                or thousands of guns and great quantities of stores,—have suddenly
                                come to a standstill, are gaining (if they gain at all) a few yards
                                here or there after days of savage fighting and terrible losses and
                                with, after a whole year of one prolonged battle, a gain of perhaps
                                the width of the District of Columbia at some one point on a line
                                450 miles in length.</p>
                            <p>All of this happened in 1917. Was it to be repeated, even only
                                partially, in 1918? Whatever we may think now, in the light of
                                subsequent knowledge, it was not sure then. The Germans were making
                                a well executed retreat. They were losing heavily, but they had lost
                                heavily in the previous retreat of 1917. That they were beaten, so
                                far as concerned their war aims, there was no doubt. But there is a
                                wide difference between a beaten enemy and one that is “down and
                                out”. The German army was “down and out” on the signing of the
                                armistice but not before. In the rapid retreat and rapid advance the
                                Allies had necessarily left behind heavy artillery and other
                                material necessary to break the German resistance if the latter’s
                                army of between three and four million men should be able to reach a
                                prepared position, or one naturally suitable for defense, in German
                                territory; while at the same time the Germans had this material,
                                except such as was abandoned (as they had done in 1917), with them.
                                The advance was costly for the Allies and they had reached a point
                                where they were unable to make good the losses and keep up their
                                fighting units.</p>
                            <p>The campaigning season was approaching its end. If the Allies should
                                find themselves confronted by a position on which the Germans had
                                “dug-in” it would be necessary to promptly break this resistance or
                                face the certainty of another winter under arms. To break it
                                required the long process of preparing positions, bringing up the
                                heavy guns, the ammunition and stores of all kinds,—and for this
                                precious time was lacking.</p>
                            <p>All of this brought the political leaders of the Allies face to face
                                with the grave problem of the morale of their civil populations.
                                Would their peoples accept even the possibility of another year of
                                war when they knew that the enemy had agreed to peace on the basis
                                    <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0334"/>of the Fourteen Points
                                which had been approved and accepted by the common people
                                everywhere? There may have been then a few enthusiasts who believed
                                that the enemy was finally “on the run” and who did not admit even a
                                chance in his favor. But these were not found among the Allies and
                                the great majority viewed the possibilities of the problem about as
                                has been outlined above.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the Allied political leaders had, on the one hand, the chance
                                of the enemy’s complete annihilation; they had, on the other hand,
                                the chance of meeting a check for the winter, with its consequent
                                effect on their own peoples. On the one hand, they had their armies
                                which, whatever we may think now, would have been in a serious
                                condition were they to meet with the appalling losses of another
                                desperate battle. Already, battles or campaigns had been stopped by
                                popular demand resulting from such losses. On the other hand, they
                                had behind them peoples hungry, cold, every household in mourning,
                                dazed and stupefied by the incredible losses already incurred.
                                Excluding the United States, the Allies of Europe and Japan had
                                mobilized 35,404,864 men; of these 4,705,665 were killed and
                                10,870,025 wounded; while 4,941,870 had been captured or were
                                reported missing, a large part of which number were dead at the time
                                of the armistice. It is not necessary to repeat here the money cost
                                of the war up to the armistice and the accumulated burden of debt
                                under which the Allied world would stagger for generations
                                unborn.</p>
                            <p>It was to peoples who had made these sacrifices and were to bear the
                                resulting burden, and all to attain the objects set forth in the
                                Fourteen Points, that the political leaders had to say whether they
                                would discuss a peace proposed by the enemy on the basis of those
                                Fourteen Points. Could there be any doubt as to their decision? What
                                had they to gain, except revenge, by going to Berlin with a loss of
                                another million men and a further burden of debt of an unknown
                                number of billions of dollars? We might have secured at that cost a
                                more complete military impotency on the part of Germany. But that
                                might have been attained in the Armistice itself. It was my belief
                                then, as it is now, that had the demand for disarmament and
                                demobilization been made, as the one condition for an armistice,
                                immediately after October 23, it would have been accepted. If
                                declined, it would have given the only justification for continuing
                                the war. It was not made because the Allied Nations had a lurking
                                fear of the possibility that it might be declined while they
                                believed that their war aims could be attained without taking this
                                chance. They may have been right,—who can now tell? Those things
                                will now lie forever “on the knees of the gods”, a fruitful theme of
                                speculation and controversy.</p>

                                </note>, Germany would long ago have been disarmed and without an
                                army other than necessary for her admitted internal needs. Had this
                                been done there would now be no biassed contention in the United
                                States that this government forced an armistice on the unwilling
                                Allies.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, a meeting of the three prime ministers had been hastily
                                summoned in Paris (not at Versailles) on October 5th, 1918. At this
                                conference they did not sit as the Supreme War Council but as a
                                Council of the Prime Ministers. The purpose of this conference was
                                not made public, and, up to its final development, the only
                                speculation that I heard was that the meeting was called for the
                                purpose of arriving at an agreement about the situation existing at
                                that moment in the Balkans. For a long time, in anticipation of the
                                inevitable end, this had been the subject of anxious thought among
                                the Military Representatives. They believed that it would be a great
                                misfortune if the war, which began with an overt act resulting from
                                the Balkan situation, should end with a sudden collapse of all
                                resistance in that quarter and still find no general principles of
                                adjustment agreed upon among the European Powers. But, up to the
                                end, the demands of the war elsewhere absorbed all attention. It may
                                be, too, that the underlying possibilities for controversy were so
                                dangerous as to make the Allies indisposed to attempt the settlement
                                of this burning question until forced to do so; this attitude being
                                due, perhaps, to a desire not to bring on the consideration of any
                                question having in it the seeds of dissension before the Alliance
                                had attained the principal object of beating the common enemy.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, there were some who believed that, whatever might have
                                been the ostensible purpose of the meeting which so hastily
                                assembled the Prime Ministers in Paris, there was also another
                                object <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0336"/>in view, and,
                                perhaps, the more important of the two. Rumors of appeals from the
                                German Government to that of the United States, made or to be made,
                                were rife. The moment was provocative of suspicion. There were some
                                who did not see how such an appeal could be made or entertained
                                without the possibility of a separate peace or, at least, of such
                                action as would reduce the Allies to playing second part in the
                                making of a general peace.</p>
                            <p>I was, therefore, not very much surprised when, at 9:00 p. m., Sunday
                                night October 7th, 1918, I received the following communication from

                            <p>I recognized at once the importance and delicacy of the situation. I
                                did not know whether this subject was or was not at that moment
                                under consideration by the Government at Washington. When I received
                                the above communication I was informed that a meeting of the
                                Military Representatives would be held at 9:15 a. m. the following
                                day for its consideration. I, therefore, at once cabled the document
                                to Washington. I asked for immediate instructions, having stated
                                that I should take no action whatever in this matter without formal
                                instructions, but would keep my Government advised of whatever
                                agreement was reached by my colleagues.</p>
                            <p>The document thus presented to the Military Representatives, was, of
                                course, intended only as a basis for further study, and this
                                accounts for certain oversights from the purely military point of
                                view. Only <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0337"/>one paragraph in
                                it required immediate action by the enemy, and this action was only
                                tentative. The other paragraphs fixed no time limit. One of them
                                would permit the German Army, with its organization and armament
                                intact, to retire to any strong position behind the Rhine which it
                                might select. No guarantees were exacted of the enemy except the
                                evacuation of certain territory which she was sure to lose anyway.
                                The Military Representatives and their Naval associates met the
                                following morning, October 8th, and drew up the following document,
                                in reply to the request of the Prime Ministers, which is embodied in
                                my cablegram to the War Department dated the same day:</p>

                            <p>Under date of October 21, 1918, I received a telegram from Washington
                                directing me to submit a summary of views in regard to the <pb
                                    n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0339"/>armistice terms. In my
                                reply, dated October 23d, I expressed the opinion that the armistice
                                terms should be purely military in character and not embody terms
                                intended to foreshadow the peace terms. It was my opinion that the
                                armistice should be a cessation of all military operations,
                                accompanied by the exaction of such guarantees as would make it
                                hopeless for the Central Powers to attempt to resume the war and
                                which would thus enable the civilian representatives of the
                                respective governments to come together to consider and impose the
                                terms of a wise peace. My general view, therefore, was that we
                                should secure a complete military disarmament, so complete that
                                there could be no hope on the part of the enemy of an attempt to
                                resume hostilities, and then to proceed with the discussion and
                                settlement of the terms of peace.</p>
                            <p>I met Mr. House on his arrival at Brest on the morning of Friday,
                                October 25th, and handed to him a copy of my telegram to Washington
                                of October 23d. At the same time, I informed him that the
                                representatives of the Allies were then assembled in Paris to
                                arrange the terms of an armistice. After our arrival in Paris, I had
                                a conference on the morning of October 27th with Mr. House at his
                                residence on the Rue de l’Université at which he discussed with me
                                the views of the Commanders-in-Chief of the national armies and of
                                the Inter-Allied Commander-in-Chief in regard to the armistice. I
                                then learned that none of them demanded what I believed to be
                                necessary, viz.; a complete disarmament of the land and naval forces
                                of Germany, leaving her, however, enough of her “home guard” troops
                                to preserve internal order. The longest step, then under
                                contemplation, toward attaining this took from Germany only a
                                specified proportion of the equipment of her active army. I was of
                                the opinion that it was dangerous to leave the German Army intact,
                                with all of its organization perfected, with all its infantry rifles
                                and ammunition, with at least half of its machine-guns, and with
                                probably half its artillery,—to leave all of these with an army of
                                between three and four millions of men to take up a selected
                                position on the other side of the Rhine. I maintained that no one
                                knew how many machine-guns and how many pieces of artillery might
                                still be available in Germany for re-arming this intact army. On the
                                other hand, if we could obtain disarmament and demobilization, we
                                would be in a position to take any measures that common justice
                                suggested and to obtain every one of our war aims.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion nothing but the complete disintegration of the German
                                Army which immediately followed the armistice, saved us from a
                                dangerous situation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. House then asked me to give him a memorandum expressing my views.
                                I told him that my memorandum would express the same idea that was
                                contained in my telegram to Washington of October <pb n="294"
                                    xml:id="pg_294" facs="0340"/>23d. I accordingly prepared and
                                submitted my memorandum dated October 28th, 1918, as follows:</p>

                                            determine and enforce such changes in
                                            world-conditions,—incidental to the war but not
                                            necessarily forming part of the terms of peace,—as are
                                            agreed upon as vital for the orderly progress of
                                            civilization and the continued peace of the

                                <p>“Such I conceive to be the three phases that will mark the close
                                    of this war and which, if properly developed, will follow the
                                    war with an epoch-making peace.</p>
                                <p>“These phases should be kept separate and distinct. The
                                    conditions accompanying one should not and need not be confused
                                    with those of another.</p>
                                <p>“It is for the military men to recommend the military conditions
                                    under which hostilities may cease so that the political
                                    governments may begin to talk, without fear of interruption by a
                                    resumption of hostilities.</p>
                                <p>“What is the object to be kept in mind, in imposing military
                                    conditions to guarantee against resumption of hostilities?</p>
                                <p>“It is to ensure the ability of the powers associated in the war
                                    against the enemy to secure all of their just war-aims, for
                                    which they have prosecuted the war.</p>
                                <p>“It is conceivable that the enemy will accept one set of
                                    conditions that will ensure the attainment of these war aims,
                                    but will reject another set of conditions intended to ensure the
                                    same thing. In that case insistence on the latter will mean
                                    continued war with the attainment of the same aims at the end of
                                    it as might be obtained now, with the probability that the enemy
                                    may be less able then to meet some of the just demands.</p>
                                <p>“If it is considered possible that the enemy will accept certain
                                    so-called military conditions that have been proposed for his
                                    surrender, <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0341"/>it is quite
                                    certain that he will accept others. In that case, the real
                                    question is ‘Will these two sets of conditions equally
                                    accomplish the essential object, to-wit, cessation of
                                    hostilities without power on the part of the enemy to resume
                                    them?’</p>
                                <p>“Apparently, all are agreed that there must be a complete
                                    military surrender on the part of the enemy as a preliminary to
                                    anything else. How shall this surrender be effected and made
                                    evident?</p>
                                <p>“It has been proposed, as one way to accomplish this, that there
                                    should be a partial disarmament by the enemy, accompanied by
                                    imposition of certain conditions which apparently foreshadow
                                    (and will be regarded by the enemy as foreshadowing) certain of
                                    the peace terms. This partial disarmament, apparently, leaves
                                    the enemy with the organization of his army intact, with his
                                    infantry armament intact, with an unknown amount of his
                                    artillery and half of his machine guns, and with apparently
                                    reserves of ammunition intact. If, during the subsequent period,
                                    this army can receive its missing armament, either from reserve
                                    stores of which there is no absolutely certain information, or
                                    from any other source, it is ready to receive it and then might
                                    again become a formidable object to deal with. If the enemy
                                    accepts such conditions, and is acting in perfectly good faith,
                                    it is even more certain that it will accept complete disarmament
                                    and demobilization without the imposition of conditions which,
                                    coming at the very first moment, may be very doubtful in their
                                    effect. If, on the other hand, the enemy accepts these
                                    conditions and is not acting in good faith, it will be because
                                    he thinks that these conditions are more favorable to his
                                    possible subsequent resumption of hostilities. If we secure
                                    partial disarmament accompanied by the other conditions
                                    proposed, and it does not prevent subsequent resumption of
                                    hostilities, then we will have failed in our purpose. If we
                                    secure complete disarmament and demobilization of the active
                                    land and naval forces no other guaranty against resumption of
                                    hostilities is needed and the powers concerned will be
                                    guaranteed the attainment of all their just war aims. If the
                                    enemy refuses complete disarmament and demobilization, it will
                                    be an evidence of his intent not to act in good faith.</p>
                                <p>“I, therefore, propose the following:—</p>
                                <p>“First, that the associated powers demand complete military
                                    disarmament and demobilization of the active land and naval
                                    forces of the enemy, leaving only such interior guards as the
                                    associated powers agree upon as necessary for the preservation
                                    of order in the home territory of the enemy. This, of itself,
                                    means the evacuation of all invaded territory, and its
                                    evacuation by disarmed and not by armed or partly armed men. The
                                    army thus disarmed cannot fight, and demobilized cannot be
                                    reassembled for the purposes of this war.</p>
                                <p>“Second, that the associated powers notify the enemy that there
                                    will be no relaxation in their war aims but that these will be
                                    subject to full and reasonable discussion between the nations
                                    associated in the war; and that even though the enemy himself
                                    may be heard on some of these matters he must submit to whatever
                                    the associated powers finally agree upon as being proper to
                                    demand for the present and for the future peace of the
                                    world.”</p>

                            <p>This memorandum was presented to Mr. House on October 28th, and two
                                days later while I was waiting to see him at his apartment, 78 rue
                                de l’Université, where a meeting of the Prime Ministers was being
                                held, he came out from the council chamber and handed me my
                                memorandum stating that the Council had decided against the
                                proposition for absolute and complete disarmament and demobilization
                                of the enemy forces. In doing this they equally declined to accept
                                the opinion of the Military and Naval Representatives expressed in
                                their “Joint Opinion” of October 8th, which was “that the first
                                essential of an armistice is the disarmament of the enemy, under the
                                control of the Allies”.</p>
                            <p>From the time of Mr. House’s arrival in Paris until October 31, 1918,
                                the general conditions of the armistice had been the study of the
                                Council of Ministers assisted by such other persons as, from time to
                                time, they called upon for information and advice. In this way a
                                rough draft of proposed armistice terms was drawn up and was first
                                presented at the first meeting of the Eighth Session of the Supreme
                                War Council held at the Trianon Palace (Hotel), Versailles, on
                                Thursday, the 31st of October, 1918, at 3 p. m. This meeting of the
                                Supreme War Council and the subsequent ones up to the final adoption
                                of the armistice terms, was attended by varying representation of
                                other powers not formally represented on the Supreme War Council. At
                                the 4th and last meeting of the Eighth Session, at which the
                                armistice terms were approved, the other powers represented were
                                Japan, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Serbia and Czecho-Slovakia.</p>

                                Council were also the most important of the Commissioners
                                Plenipotentiary to the Peace Conference. The function of this
                                conference was simply and solely to make peace with the Central
                                Powers. But, many military and politico-military questions kept
                                arising which <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0345"/>for the most
                                part had nothing to do with the making of peace terms but which grew
                                out of the war which those peace terms were intended to end.</p>
                            <p>Were the heads of governments then sitting at that time in their
                                respective capitals, these questions would have been considered
                                either by exchange of diplomatic notes or would have been sent as
                                before, to the Military Representatives at Versailles for their
                                joint note of recommendations.</p>
                            <p>But, as they were actually sitting in Paris, it was natural and,
                                indeed, quite necessary for them, as heads of governments, to refer
                                these questions to themselves in their capacity as members of the
                                Supreme War Council and to its military and other advisers. If the
                                result of this reference concerned the terms then being formulated
                                by the Peace Conference, it was brought to the latter’s attention;
                                otherwise, action was taken in the usual course or procedure of the
                                Supreme War Council.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, its general character, together with the scope of its
                                work, ended with the Armistice. This was due to the fact that the
                                questions arising no longer related to the conduct of the war
                                against the Central Powers but were post-war and world-wide in their
                                nature. This necessitated varying additions to the personnel,
                                according to the problem under consideration, although the original
                                personnel of the Council remained unchanged.</p>
                            <p>A summary of the reports of the Military Representatives made in
                                conformity with these references by the Peace Conference will be
                                found in appendix (I).<note n="12" xml:id="d147fn57">Not
                                    printed.</note> As these reports to a certain extent grew out of
                                the work of the Peace Conference and in any event had nothing to do
                                with the Supreme War Council as an agency for the effective
                                prosecution of the war no further comment on them seems to be here
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p>It is, however, desired to emphasize the fact that not only the
                                Military Representatives and their staffs but the entire personnel
                                of the Supreme War Council were imbued with the most earnest desire
                                to aid as far as possible in bringing about the prompt and decisive
                                defeat of the Central Empires; and, as a necessary outgrowth of this
                                spirit they became at once a homogeneous and unified body able to
                                decide upon united action. As enjoined by M. Clemenceau at the 2nd
                                Session of the Supreme War Council on December 1st, 1917, they had
                                been able to consider the good of the Allies as a whole and, when a
                                difference of opinion arose, as it inevitably did from time to time,
                                they were able to find a happy mean policy which secured effective
                                action without one or another of them insisting upon some national
                                aim inconsistent <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0346"/>with the
                                interests of any other one of the nations concerned. It was in the
                                same spirit of “give and take” that the political members discussed
                                and solved their special problems which were often of graver
                                importance than the military ones. The Supreme War Council has
                                proved that such an international body can work in unison and
                                harmony; and it is in the belief that the members of any similar
                                international council will in the future be inspired by the same
                                spirit, that the hope of an ultimately successful League of Nations
                                must rest.</p>

                            <p>1. The American Permanent Military Representative, member of the
                                Executive Committee, submits to his colleagues on the Executive
                                Committee, the following views which he proposes for their
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>2. It is his view that the Supreme War Council in its Resolution of
                                February 2<note n="13" xml:id="d147fn58">

                                General Reserve and charged the Executive Committee with certain
                                duties as to its composition and use. This decree and these
                                instructions of the Supreme War Council are mandatory, and the
                                Executive Committee cannot abdicate the duties and responsibilities
                                with which it is charged, merely because a Commander-in-Chief has
                                stated that he cannot agree with it as to one point, which point is
                                a question of method and procedure rather than of general
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>3. The letter of February 6<note n="14" xml:id="d147fn59">See <ref

                                        >258</ref>.</note> was not final and conclusive, although it
                                conveyed what was at that time the best judgment of the Executive
                                Committee as to the formation of the Inter-Allied General Reserve.
                                It was a basis of discussion with the Commanders-in-Chief, in which
                                the Executive Committee formulated its ideas and submitted them in
                                compliance with that part of the Resolution of the Supreme War
                                Council which required that its “powers should be exercised after
                                consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armies concerned.”
                                This means that the Executive Committee must give careful
                                consideration to the views of the Commanders-in-Chief; but these
                                latter have no power, by a mere difference of opinion, to abrogate
                                the will of the Supreme War Council nor to discharge the Executive
                                Committee from the execution of the functions imposed upon it by
                                that <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0347"/>War Council. In case
                                of an irreconcilable difference of opinion between the Executive
                                Committee and the Commander-in-Chief, it is the duty of the former
                                to exercise its best judgment, to organize the Inter-Allied General
                                Reserve according to that best judgment, to report to the Supreme
                                War Council that it has performed in full the duty which that War
                                Council imposed upon it, and, therefore, to submit the organization
                                which it thinks best for the Inter-Allied General Reserve, leaving
                                the Supreme War Council to modify this organization at its
                                pleasure.</p>
                            <p>The Committee created by the Supreme War Council is an executive one
                                and not an advisory one; and it is the duty of an executive
                                committee to carry something into execution. This particular
                                Executive Committee is charged with the duty of carrying into
                                execution the mandatory will of the Supreme War Council when it
                                decreed the creation of an Inter-Allied General Reserve. The Supreme
                                War Council is composed solely of the heads of the four great
                                Governments which constitute the Alliance for the prosecution of the
                                war,—that is to say, it is composed of these four Governments. The
                                Executive Committee is, therefore, the agent for carrying into
                                effect the expressed will of the Entente Alliance. This Alliance has
                                not placed it in the power of any Commander-in-Chief to veto its
                                will; nor has it given to the Executive Committee any authority to
                                listen to or to be guided by any such attempted veto.</p>
                            <p>It has been suggested that, perhaps, if one Commander-in-Chief says
                                that he is unable to contribute any troops to the Inter-Allied
                                General Reserve, the other Commanders-in-Chief will do the same. Who
                                is to decide this? Manifestly, it is neither the Commanders-in-Chief
                                nor the Executive Committee, but solely the Entente Alliance itself.
                                How can the Alliance determine whether a particular
                                Commander-in-Chief can or cannot contribute troops to the
                                Inter-Allied General Reserve? Primarily, it can do this only after
                                consideration of the best judgment of its Executive Committee as
                                expressed in the final organization prepared by the Executive
                                Committee. The Executive Committee cannot, because it has no power
                                to do so, be guided by the views of any Commander-in-Chief, who, in
                                effect, opposes himself to the expressed will of the Entente
                                Alliance. The Executive Committee must be guided by those views of
                                Commanders-in-Chief which are helpful to it in its execution of the
                                mandate of the Alliance as represented by the Supreme War Council.
                                If those views are not helpful to it, the Executive Committee must
                                use its best judgment in the formulation of an Inter-Allied General
                                Reserve and allow the Commander-in-Chief to make his protest to the
                                Supreme War Council.</p>
                            <p>4. The letter of February 6, which was the basis of discussion with
                                the Commanders-in-Chief, having been submitted to them, certain <pb
                                    n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0348"/>written and verbal
                                consultations with the French and Italian Commanders-in-Chief which
                                followed resulted in an agreement with them which was a modification
                                of the original scheme. The consultation with the British
                                Commander-in-Chief has resulted in a statement by him to the effect
                                that he has made plans to assist, if necessary, any other part of
                                the Franco-British Front with a force which is substantially the
                                same as that which was asked of him by the Executive Committee in
                                the letter of February 6. But he declines to set this force apart in
                                any particular area, for the reasons given by him in, his letter to
                                the Executive Committee. His views are not at all inconsistent with
                                the performance of his share in the creation of the Inter-Allied
                                General Reserve. His letter concedes in principle all that has been
                                asked of him. It is not absolutely necessary that his Inter-Allied
                                Reserve divisions should be stationed in any particular area or
                                areas. It is sufficient for our purpose that they exist somewhere in
                                his zone of operations. In case of difference of opinion on such a
                                point it is better that the Executive Committee should subordinate
                                its judgment to that of the local Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                            <p>It is true that the British Commander-in-Chief contemplates the use
                                of his Reserve solely for the assistance of the French front, and
                                that the French Commander-in-Chief contemplates the use of his
                                Reserve solely for the assistance of the British Front. This is not
                                a point in regard to which the Executive Committee need, at this
                                time, urge any objection. The chances are very great that the
                                British part of the Inter-Allied Reserve will eventually be used
                                either on its own front or on the French Front; and there are the
                                same chances that the French part of this General Reserve will
                                eventually be used only on its front or on the British front. If the
                                development of the campaign should ever make it necessary to
                                consider the question of sending any of these forces to the Italian
                                Front, the situation at the time would undoubtedly be such that this
                                step would be taken only by the common consent of all. It is quite
                                certain that if there were any reasonable doubt at the time, the
                                Executive Committee, which must act unanimously, would not take such
                                action. At any rate, this is a bridge which we need not attempt to
                                cross until we come to it.</p>
                            <p>5. The Executive Committee has, therefore, succeeded in the execution
                                of the task assigned to it by the Supreme War Council, to the extent
                                of forming an Inter-Allied General Reserve consisting of a certain
                                number of Italian, French, and British Divisions, subject to certain
                                conditions desired to be imposed by the respective
                                Commanders-in-Chief and which conditions are not inconsistent with
                                the general principle of the Inter-Allied Reserve. These divisions
                                are as follows: <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0349"/>

                            <p>It seems reasonable to assume that if any British Divisions are
                                returned to that front from the Italian Front, they will be
                                available to increase that part of the General Reserve on that
                                front.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the Inter-Allied General Reserve, subject to certain conditions
                                which are not incompatible with the principle of a General Reserve,
                                would consist of twenty-six divisions, having an approximately total
                                strength of 316,000 men exclusive of Army Artillery and
                                Aviation.</p>
                            <p>6. The American Permanent Military Representative, in his capacity as
                                member of the Executive Committee, proposes that the Executive

                    <p>The Ambassador called and showed me two small volumes entitled “When a Man
                        Comes to Himself,” President Wilson being the author. On <ref
                            target="#pg_26">pages 26</ref> and <ref target="#pg_27">27</ref> of
                        these volumes appeared certain comments upon Russia and the Czar, which the
                        Ambassador considered to be criticisms which might cause serious
                        embarrassment in case the volumes reached Russia. He showed me that while
                        the volumes appeared to be duplicates, they were evidently separate
                        editions, in the second of which there was an attempt to soften the language
                        regarding Russia, but that it still was objectionable.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to the Ambassador that, while the volumes were published this
                        year, the original copyright taken out by Harper &amp; Brothers was in 1901,
                        and therefore the statements could not be taken as representing the views of
                        the President to-day.</p>
                    <p>He replied that it was to be presumed that the President permitted the
                        publication and if so, it would represent his views. To that I answered that
                        as the copyright was owned by Harper &amp; Brothers, they may have published
                        the volumes without the knowledge of the President, but in order to clear up
                        the matter, I would submit the volumes to the President.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of April 2nd I submitted the two volumes to the Secretary of
                        State, who transmitted them to the President, with a statement of the views
                        of the Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>On April 5th I received from the Secretary the annexed note from the
                            President<note n="1" xml:id="d148fn1">

                        in relation to these volumes.</p>
                    <p>On April 6th I communicated the contents of the note to the Russian
                        Ambassador in an interview at my office in the Department.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Russian Ambassador has
                        called on Mr. Lansing today and showed him two editions of “When a Man <pb
                            n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0354"/>Comes to Himself” pointing out the
                        language which you showed me the other day. It seems that there are two
                        editions—one is slightly different from the other.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador calls attention to the fact that the a [<hi rend="italic"
                            >sic</hi>] part of the remarks about Russia had been changed, but the
                        change does not seem any more satisfactory than the original language.</p>
                    <p>I thought you ought to know that he had been here and expressed his
                        embarrassment. He was afraid of the effect of the publication in Russia of
                        extracts in regard to their people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lansing pointed out to him that the copyright is by Harper Brothers and
                        taken out in 1901, and he also suggested to him that in the multitude of
                        cares you had doubtless not had time to look over the speeches before they
                        were reprinted.</p>
                    <p>I am wondering whether you will think it worth while to say anything to the
                        Ambassador and whether if you desire to say anything, you would rather say
                        it to him orally than in writing. I am inclined to think if you make any
                        correction at all it would be better to follow Mr. Lansing’s suggestion and
                        see him personally—this not only has the advantage of leaving nothing that
                        can be hereafter printed, but an explanation can be spoken much more
                        impressively than it can be written.</p>
                    <p>If it is done at all it is probably best to do it at once as the Ambassador
                        seemed quite agitated about it.</p>

                        Russian Ambassador that this is the republication of an essay which I wrote
                        and first published more than twenty years ago, and that the passage he
                        refers to does not express my present opinion at all?</p>
                    <p>When the publishers proposed to me its republication I did not remember that
                        it contained any such passage. I ought to have reread it, but I did not have
                        time. I never dreamed I had said anything like this. I could not have
                        rewritten it, but I would have prevented its republication.</p>

                    <p>526. Took charge 28th on arrival. Dearing<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn1">F. M.
                            Dearing, counselor of embassy.</note> had arranged with Foreign Office
                        initial informal visits with Minister of Foreign Affairs and President
                        Council of Ministers. Latter received me 3 o’clock afternoon 29th. He
                        received me cordially; we exchanged views freely concerning relations
                        between our countries, each expressing desire to promote existing friendly
                        feeling. I expressed a desire and intention actively to endeavor to
                        establish and foster direct commercial relations between the two countries
                        without any intermediary whatever, in which he heartily concurred. Called on
                        Sazonoff 6 o’clock, being accompanied by Dearing in both visits. Had
                        conference hour and 20 minutes with Sazonoff, who was cordial, courteous,
                        attentive, candid, responsive, but surprised me immeasurably when he said
                        with the [apparent omission] positiveness that no commercial treaty can now
                        be negotiated. I called his attention to Marye’s<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn2"
                            >George T. Marye, predecessor of Ambassador Francis in Russia.</note>
                        report that Russia had been awaiting advances from us for negotiating new
                        treaties and expressed willingness and desire therefor. He admitted so
                        telling Marye but said that was 6 months ago and subject was never broached
                        again by Marye, that too late now because Allies had called an economic
                        conference for June 1st Paris, and Russia will negotiate no commercial
                        conventions with any country before that conference. He intimated that such
                        conference might determine to establish different commercial relations with
                        Allies, with friendly countries and with belligerents. He also insinuated
                        that when commercial treaty is negotiated it would specially export [<hi
                            rend="italic">sic</hi>] to those countries which extend like favors to
                        Russia in import duties. He furthermore stated in good spirit that the
                        denouncing by us of the treaty of 1832<note n="4" xml:id="d151fn3">See <ref

                            ff.</note> had created no resentment in Russia and had not interfered
                        with the trade between the countries which he said would continue, he
                        trusted, in the future as in the past. I said his position was surprising
                        and disappointing to me to a degree and ventured further the statement that
                        the principal object of my appointment as advised by yourself and President
                        Wilson was to negotiate treaty on commerce and navigation. Attempted to
                        impress him with friendly interest in Russia now cherished by our people
                        with our appreciation of Russia’s manifestations of good will <pb n="310"
                            xml:id="pg_310" facs="0356"/>in the past and with expressed desire by
                        our commercial classes to foster Russian commerce. He expressed
                        gratification at such statements but remained firm in refusing consideration
                        of the commercial treaty certainly until after the Allied conference at
                        which Russia will be represented by comptroller of the Empire and four other
                        potential [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] officials. Expressed hope that my
                        ambassadorial mission would prove agreeable and interesting and smilingly
                        said duties of position would be sufficiently onerous without negotiating
                        treaty. Said had heard rumor that my appointment was influenced by German
                        sympathy and had questioned Bakhmeteff thereon but Bakhmeteff’s reply said
                        such rumor groundless and consequently Government here wholly uninfluenced
                        by rumor which he did not credit. Returned to Embassy at 7:30 p. m., and
                        immediately sent a note to Sazonoff as per arrangement asking when Emperor
                        would receive me. Sazonoff forwarded same to Emperor immediately and am
                        expecting reply to-day. Hope Emperor will receive me before returning to
                        front but if so such action will be almost unprecedentedly prompt. Sazonoff
                        in conference with Dearing March 30th expressed no opposition to
                        negotiations commercial treaty although Dearing says that cannot recall that
                        he definitely expressed willingness therefor, while expressing
                        disappointment that Marye’s negotiations had not been carried further.
                        Consequently conclude Sazonoff’s opposition is the result of recent
                        conferences with Allies. Respectfully suggest I have lost no time since
                        arrival morning 28th.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I cabled you Sunday of my
                        arrival and of my taking charge on April 28, and of sending a note on the
                        same day to the Foreign Office and of my conference with the Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs and also with the President of the Council of Ministers. My
                        conferences with both of these officials was set forth almost in detail in
                        the cablegram; consequently I shall not tire your patience in a résumé
                        further than to say that the statement of Mr. Sazonoff was so surprising and
                        inexplicable to me that I have been endeavoring since the interview to
                        ascertain the cause for this change of position or of policy on the part of
                        Russia toward the United States in regard to a commercial treaty.</p>
                    <p>I wrote you at length twice on the steamer while en route from New York to
                        Christiania, and in both letters expressed my fear that certain interests in
                        New York were making effort to have all trade <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311"
                            facs="0357"/>between our country and Russia pay tribute to England as an
                            intermediary.<note n="5" xml:id="d152fn1">For letter of Apr. 10, 1916,
                            to the Secretary of State, and letter of Apr. 8, 1916, to President
                            Wilson, a copy of which was enclosed, see Hearings Before the Special
                            Committee Investigating the Munitions Industry, United States Senate,

                            8704-8707.</note> Since arriving here my fears have not been dissipated;
                        in fact I have heard many things which confirm the suspicions I have
                        cherished.</p>
                    <p>The economic conference between the Allies which is fixed for Paris June
                        first was, in my judgment, inspired by England, as that country is making
                        decided effort to occupy toward Russia the position held by Germany before
                        the war. It is true that both Sazonoff and Stürmer expressed themselves as
                        favoring direct commercial relations between their country and ours, but the
                        English influence here is very strong and a persistent effort is being made
                        to strengthen it. The loan which was being negotiated in New York some eight
                        weeks ago, but for some unaccountable reason has not been consummated, was
                        alluded to by Sazonoff in my interview with him, and he expressed the
                        opinion that it would be impossible for America to get what he called double
                        security on any loan our banks might make to Russia. When I asked him what
                        he meant by double security he said that our capitalists were demanding in
                        addition to the obligation specific collateral. I told him that no country
                        now engaged in war would be able to negotiate a loan in America without
                        collateral and cited my experience and that of others with the Anglo-French
                        loan which we were unable to sell at 98, as we endeavored to do; and in fact
                        never since the expiration of the syndicate have we been able to dispose of
                        those securities without loss. From 96¼ it declined to 93⅝, and when I left
                        America was selling at 95. All of this I told Mr. Sazonoff, but he persisted
                        in saying that Russia would make no loan that required any security other
                        than the faith or credit of the government itself.</p>
                    <p>In talking with Mr. Meserve, a representative of the National City Bank, on
                        Saturday he told me that Russia had agreed, or was about to agree early in
                        March, to the requirements of New York bankers, but subsequently refused to
                        do so, and the only way of accounting for the change in position was the
                        influence of England which was desirous that all foreign relations of a
                        commercial or financial character had by Russia should be through
                        London.</p>
                    <p>In a talk with a gentleman today who has had a great deal of experience in
                        Russia and is well known in the United States, the opinion was expressed
                        that Bark, who is the Minister of Finance of Russia, is completely under
                        British influence, and the same gentleman went so far as to state that in
                        his judgment Sazonoff is held in <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0358"
                        />the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs by British rather than by
                        Russian support. If this is true, and I am not prepared to question it, we
                        can account for Russia’s change of front concerning the commercial treaty
                        with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sazonoff seemed to be prepared for my broaching the subject of a
                        commercial treaty, because when I did so he very promptly stated that Russia
                        would make no commercial treaty now with any country whatever. In addition
                        to expressing sincere disappointment on the part of our government and our
                        people generally, I made effort to impress upon Mr. Sazonoff that personally
                        I so regretted his position that if not discouraged I was greatly chagrined
                        because of the apparent impossibility of achieving what was my main object
                        in accepting the Russian mission. Our interview was in good spirit on both
                        sides, but there was no variation in his expression to the effect that
                        nothing certainly would be considered until after the Paris conference.</p>

                    <p>The Embassy building is in very poor condition. I am sleeping in the Embassy
                        and taking breakfast here, which is furnished by the wife of one of the
                        messengers; my luncheon and dinner I get elsewhere. Of course I shall not
                        keep up this manner of life because, regardless of my own pleasure and
                        convenience, it is not becoming to an American Ambassador. I shall not go to
                        a hotel; the Astoria has been requisitioned by the government for the
                        exclusive accommodation of army officers. The Hotel de l’Europe is full to
                        overflowing, and there is no other hotel in the city which would comport
                        with the dignity of an American ambassador. Mr. Dearing has written you
                        concerning the needs of the Embassy and I have only to add thereto that if
                        we would make headway with the people of this great country it is advisable,
                        if not necessary, that our representative here should live in a manner that
                        would not reflect upon our country by comparison with the representatives of
                        other governments. I have met no official Russians other than those
                        mentioned above, but I have met many Americans whose number seems to be
                        increasing from week to week.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: In my various communications
                        addressed to you and Mr. Polk and Mr. Phillips from here, I have written
                        nothing about the Jewish question which in our conferences in Washington
                        appeared to us as the only stumbling block in the way of negotiating a
                        commercial treaty.</p>
                    <p>My former letter expressed surprise over Mr. Sazonoff’s remark that Russia
                        would negotiate no more commercial treaties at this time. In the course of
                        his conversation, after remarking twice or more that the treaty had been
                        denounced by America, he said casually that he did not know why it had been
                        denounced. Thereupon I broke into the conversation and asked him if he meant
                        literally what he said, and when he repeated it I told him why the treaty
                        had been abrogated by President Taft, thinking that might turn his attention
                        to the Jewish question. He brushed it aside, however, and went on to talk
                        about something else. That was the only mention of the Jewish question in my
                        conference of an hour and twenty-five minutes with the Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs. I did not think it advisable to broach the Jewish question again;
                        nor was the question touched upon at all in my talk with Minister of the
                        Interior Stürmer, who is also President of the Council of Ministers. He
                        talks English very badly, however, and most of our conference was translated
                        by Secretary Dearing who accompanied me.</p>
                    <p>I am told by Harper who, as you know, accompanied me to Petrograd, and who
                        has many friends and acquaintances here, that he had been informed that it
                        was about decided that the Jewish Pale of residence will not be abolished
                        until after the close of the war; when he talked to me in America he seemed
                        confident that the Pale would be abolished <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314"
                            facs="0360"/>in the very near future. It seems that the army, which has
                        great influence in Russia now, is skeptical about the loyalty of the Jews to
                        the Russian cause. If that is true, the extension of greater privileges to
                        the Jews will not be made very soon. The army influence appears to be
                        exerted on the liberal side; it was on their advice that the Emperor went in
                        person for the first time to open the Duma Feb. 27/Mar. 7. The army is very
                        much in evidence here; soldiers are drilling by thousands in the streets
                        every day, and the Emperor reviewed between thirty and forty thousand
                        soldiers on the Champs de Mars May 1. At the Russian ballet which I saw last
                        evening a large proportion of the men in the audience were in uniform.</p>
                    <p>I had a long and very satisfactory talk on Monday last with Montgomery
                        Schuyler who was in charge of the inspection of prison camps here for
                        several months; . . . He is here now representing the <hi rend="italic">New
                            York Times</hi>. He seems disposed to second my efforts to promote
                        direct commercial relations between our country and the Russian people, and
                        agreed with my opinion that British influence is being most aggressively
                        exerted to prevent it. I see evidences of that influence, or hear of such,
                        almost every day. Very few of the Russians, however, approve of it as there
                        is a deep-seated resentment against any country occupying to Russia the
                        relation which Germany held before the war. I shall do what I can to
                        encourage such a sentiment. In my talk yesterday with Baron Korff, Master of
                        Ceremonies, who will be in attendance on the Emperor when he receives me
                        tomorrow, I again advocated direct commercial relations without any
                        intermediary, and he was in full accord with such policy.</p>

                        <p>I was called upon this morning by Mr. William P. Simms who has come to
                            Petrograd as a representative of the United Press of America, for the
                            purpose of establishing an office of that Association here. He has been
                            its representative in Paris for six or seven years past, and is very
                            familiar with conditions in France. He tells me confidentially that the
                            conference held in Paris not a great while ago between representatives
                            of the Allies cemented still more closely the bonds between them, and
                            that at that conference a plan was made to have an advance made upon
                            German forces simultaneously by all of the allied armies. It is reported
                            that 20,000 Russian troops were landed at Marseilles some days ago and
                            that others are en route there. A large number of Russian troops are
                            passing through Petrograd daily; of course, no one knows their
                            destination. Discipline camps are stationed throughout the city and in
                            the suburbs where new men are being drilled. The Emperor spends most of
                            his time at the front; he told me that he was in haste to receive me
                            because he was going <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0361"/>to return
                            to the front on Sunday,—I saw him on Friday. I am still endeavoring to
                            ascertain more about the economic conference to be held in Paris between
                            the Allies on May 19; that must be Russian time which, according to our
                            calendar, will be June first, because the representatives from Russia
                            have not yet left for Paris.</p>
                        <p>M. Viviani, ex-Premier of France, arrived here last Saturday, but his
                            arrival was not given to the public prints; in fact, when he cleared
                            from England in a man of war, it was announced that he was going to
                            return to France. This information was imparted to me by Mr. Simms who
                            came into Petrograd on the same train with M. Viviani.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The resignation of Foreign
                        Minister Sazonoff and the appointment of Minister of Interior Stürmer as his
                        successor was announced in the papers Sunday morning, July 23, and was a
                        great surprise to all classes of people and to every section of the country.
                        On Monday, July 10, upon which day I was expecting a conference with Mr.
                        Sazonoff concerning a plan between the allies and belligerents whereby
                        America could extend aid to Poland, etc., the Embassy was informed by
                        telephone that the Minister had been called to the front to confer with the
                        Emperor. Mr. Sazonoff returned to Petrograd the morning of Thursday, July
                        13. I saw him that afternoon in company with Mr. Samuel McRoberts of the
                        National City Bank of New York who had asked to pay his respects, and to
                        whom the Minister extended a cordial welcome because Mr. McRoberts had
                        formed an American syndicate which had loaned $50,000,000 to the Russian
                        Government. Mr. Sazonoff complained of being tired and said that on the
                        following day, July 14, he would go to Finland for a rest of two or three
                        weeks. He was in Finland when his resignation was announced and he is still
                        there; his plan is to return to Petrograd on Monday, July 31.</p>
                    <p>Universal regret is expressed at the retirement of Mr. Sazonoff, which he and
                        the Emperor and all members of the Government attribute to ill health. At
                        the same time there are rumors to the effect that his parting with the
                        Emperor on July 12 was not only friendly but affectionate, the Emperor, it
                        is said, kissing him three times and expressing the highest appreciation of
                        his public services. The day after the Minister’s departure the Empress
                        joined the Emperor at his military headquarters, and two days thereafter the
                            <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0362"/>departure of Mr. Sazonoff from
                        Petrograd for Finland he received a telegram asking for his immediate
                        resignation. Whether this is true no one can say authoritatively. It is
                        generally believed, however, that the Empress is very desirous for peace.
                        She has long been suspected of German sympathies. One story is to the effect
                        that when Minister Sazonoff was directed to submit to Russia’s allies
                        proposals of peace suggested by Germany, he refused to do so, whereupon Mr.
                        Stürmer, President of the Council of Ministers, said he would submit such
                        proposals if the Foreign Minister declined to do so, and that thereupon Mr.
                        Sazonoff tendered his resignation.</p>
                    <p>... It is now thought that if peace negotiations are opened and the terms of
                        peace agreed upon, Stürmer will be made Chancellor of the Empire, an office
                        which has not been filled since the days of Gortshakoff.</p>
                    <p>This would indicate that the court party of the Empire is preparing to
                        counteract what they fear will be a liberal movement on the part of the
                        people after the close of the war. It is not charged that Russia is planning
                        to make a separate peace with Germany. One report is to the effect that von
                        Lucius, present Minister from Germany at Stockholm, has recently made a
                        secret visit to Russia and has suggested terms of peace which are attractive
                        to Russia and not objectionable to France, as they provide for ceding to
                        France Lorraine which has belonged to Germany since 1870. It is not known
                        what concessions, if any, are proposed to England, but it is said that
                        Germany is willing to recognize the integrity of Belgium and to indemnify
                        her for damages inflicted. England is to be propitiated by retaining the
                        German South African colonies which she has captured. Japan will be appeased
                        by being permitted to retain the territory she has captured in the Far
                        East.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime Russia is marshalling the largest army ever assembled. She
                        has already called 16,100,000 men and in a call issued ten days ago
                        increased this number by 2,500,000, making a total of 18,600,000 men. What
                        an army! What a menace this would be to other countries if these men were
                        armed and well organized! It may be that the supporters of an absolute
                        monarchy in Russia are asking themselves what such an army well disciplined
                        and conscious of its strength will do in Russia when there are no more
                        foreign enemies to fight. These soldiers are as fine looking men as I ever
                        saw carry a musket. I have seen thousands of them coming into Petrograd in
                        obedience to a call, fresh from the fields,—boys who had never before seen a
                        village of over 2,000 inhabitants, with sunken chests, slip-shod gait and
                        careless carriage. After three or four weeks of drill, equipped with
                        military clothing, including boots of which they are very proud, they march
                        through the streets with swinging gait, head high in the <pb n="317"
                            xml:id="pg_317" facs="0363"/>air and chests out-thrown, singing, and
                        their very countenances manifesting pride in their country and consciousness
                        of their own power. After arrival in their barracks they have been given the
                        most nourishing food, including meat which previously they had not had more
                        than once a week,—soup and black bread had been the principal means of their
                        subsistence.</p>
                    <p>The last call which comprised 2,500,000 men was to go into effect July 15/28,
                        but yesterday the date when the call was to be effective was postponed from
                        July 15 to August 15. This change of date may not have any significance but
                        it was determined upon the day after Sazonoff’s resignation and Stürmer’s
                        appointment.</p>
                    <p>Minister Sazonoff was and is a bitter enemy of Germany. . . . Sazonoff’s
                        treaty with Japan was considered a very severe blow to Germany; that was his
                        conviction and the main reason he gave me for its consummation. The
                        Russo-Japanese Treaty has not been talked about very much in Russia, but in
                        Japan it has aroused the greatest enthusiasm; banquets have been held and
                        toasts have been drunk to the new alliance.</p>
                    <p>You have probably seen before reading this communication thus far that I am
                        disposed to share in the belief that the resignation of Sazonoff was forced
                        and that the promotion of Stürmer is a triumph for the party of reaction and
                        for the champions of absolute monarchy in Russia, although such a victory
                        may be due in part to the strengthening of pro-German sentiment in the
                        Empire.</p>
                    <p>Before closing I desire again to remind you that all the rumors outlined in
                        the reports narrated above are given for what they are worth and that their
                        truth is not vouched for in any degree. The official announcement and the
                        talk among diplomats is that Sazonoff was compelled to resign because he was
                        broken down in health. I spent several hours this forenoon conferring with
                        representative commercial men in Petrograd, three of whom are bank
                        presidents, and all of whom would be greatly concerned if not alarmed if
                        they were made known as the sources of the above expressions. None of these
                        rumors or reports are from American sources; all are from Russians who are
                        men of substance and of representative character, whose loyalty to their
                        country is unquestionable, but who are grieved to see their country take a
                        step which in this age of progress they consider to be a backward one.</p>
                    <p>Minister of Finance Bark who negotiated the $50,000,000 loan with the
                        National City Bank syndicate is in France, after having passed a week or
                        more in London. He left Petrograd about the middle of July and I don’t think
                        knew anything about the change in the ministry when he went away. England
                        has been financing Russia for some time past, but reports are to the effect
                        that Minister Bark has arranged <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0364"/>in
                        France for sufficient credit to pay for the munitions of war furnished by
                        that country to Russia. He has been considered completely tinder English
                        influence and has not been held in the highest esteem as a financier. Mr.
                        McRoberts, however, thought he was the ablest man he met in Petrograd, with
                        the possible exception of Sazonoff.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Referring to my personal and
                        confidential letter to you under date of July 25,—the new Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs, Baron Stürmer, who is still President of the Council of
                        Ministers, does not seem to have the respect of any of the prominent
                        Russians whom I have met. His appointment is decidedly a reactionary
                        victory. . . .</p>
                    <p>The generally accepted theory of Sazonoff’s removal and Stürmer’s appointment
                        is that the former promulgated a statement concerning the autonomy of Poland
                        with the approval of the Emperor, but without submitting same to the Council
                        of Ministers of which Stürmer was President. That gave offense to Stürmer
                        and his colleagues who complained to the Emperor who thereupon sent for
                        Sazonoff and directed him to submit the plan to his colleagues in the
                        Ministry which Sazonoff declined to do, stating that that would subject him
                        to humiliation in the event they should insist upon a change. Whether that
                        was the cause or not, however, it is generally believed that the
                        reactionaries are in the saddle and were looking for an opportunity to
                        unhorse Sazonoff who is looked upon as a liberal. In addition to that,
                        Sazonoff was said to be under the influence of England and the same charge
                        is made against the Minister of Finance, Mr. Bark, who has just returned
                        from a visit to France and England, and whose resignation is said to be
                        imminent. Baron Stürmer is said to have remarked after learning of the first
                        victory or two of General Brousiloff in Galicia, “One or two more such
                        victories and we can do away with the Duma”. Whether these reports are true
                        remains to be proven. There is no doubt, however, that the liberal or
                        progressive element in Russia is greatly disappointed and chagrined at the
                        removal of Sazonoff and the appointment of Stürmer.</p>
                    <p>I think in a former letter I stated that while the loyalty of Stürmer had
                        never been questioned, that he and the reactionaries generally <pb n="319"
                            xml:id="pg_319" facs="0365"/>were more disposed to sympathise with
                        Germany than any other element in Russia. My view concerning the benefit to
                        the plain people of Russia through their education and the broadening of
                        their views by the war is stronger now than when expressed two or three
                        weeks ago. I do not think there will be a revolution immediately after the
                        close of the war; that would be premature, but if the Court Party does not
                        adopt a more liberal policy by extending more privileges to the people and
                        their representatives in the Duma, a revolution will take place before the
                        lapse of even a few years.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, not only are the Russian people acquiring more information
                        concerning the resources of their own country, but it seems to me that the
                        attention of the world is becoming directed or fixed more intently on Russia
                        from day to day. European and American newspapers and periodicals all dwell
                        upon the magnificence of this Empire, its undeveloped wealth and its immense
                        possibilities. There will be great competition for the trade of Russia after
                        the close of the war. American enterprise is already looking with covetous
                        eyes on the mineral deposits, the great water power, and the opportunities
                        for railroad construction which this country offers. Several Americans are
                        going home by the steamer which takes this pouch, but there is not one of
                        them who is not planning to return to Russia, as all think there is no field
                        on earth to be compared with this. The National City Bank has decided to
                        open a branch here and I think it is not only a good move for that
                        institution but would prove highly beneficial to the commercial relations of
                        the two countries. I have no intention or desire to violate the neutrality
                        of America, but in my judgment American capital and ingenuity should be
                        encouraged here in order to offset, if nothing more, the well designed plan
                        of England, and perhaps France also, to capture the trade of Russia after
                        the war through the operation of the resolutions passed at the Economic
                        Conference of the Allies held in Paris June 14-17. There have been many
                        Americans here, and perhaps there are some now, who are unwise enough to
                        take advantage of the necessities of Russia to extort unreasonable prices
                        for what they have to sell; that is a short-sighted policy, however, and one
                        which I am advising all Americans to avoid. . . .</p>

                    <p>I don’t know what time you will receive this letter, but it ought to get to
                        Washington not later than April 1st, as the pouch containing it will be sent
                        by Lydig, who will leave via Vladivostok next Tuesday evening on the
                        Siberian Express and who tells me he expects to arrive in Washington about
                        the last of March. It is possible I may make him a courier only to
                        Vladivostok or to Peking, but that will depend upon what I determine is the
                        most expeditious plan.</p>
                    <p>Since writing you last there have been several very important changes. My
                        despatches advised of the delivery of the general peace note and also of the
                        note of the President concerning peace;<note n="8" xml:id="d156fn2">For

                    </p>
                    <p>The peace note of the President was not received by the Allies with unmixed
                        approval. The criticisms were mainly based upon the statement or assertion
                        that the statesmen of both sides of this contest claimed to be fighting for
                        the same objects—the critics of the note were inclined to charge that such
                        was the President’s view also. In the address to the Senate, the “peace
                        without victory” expression is what aroused opposition, which in some
                        quarters was quite bitter. The peace note and the address to the Senate
                        however were so completely overshadowed by the severing of our diplomatic
                        relations with Germany that they were not discussed nearly so much if at
                        all. I cabled you my opinion<note n="10" xml:id="d156fn4">Cable not
                            printed.</note> concerning the address to the Senate and either cabled
                        the President direct or through you my feeling concerning the stand taken
                        with Germany. I have not yet seen a word of the address of the President to
                        the Congress on February 3rd,<note n="11" xml:id="d156fn5">

                        />telegrams in the Russian papers that the stand taken has met with the
                        enthusiastic approval and support of the American people. One telegram says
                        that the Senate approved by a vote of 78 to 5; I have never seen that the
                        House has taken any definite action.</p>
                    <p>I gave a statement to the newspapers concerning the breaking off of
                        diplomatic relations with Germany immediately after the receipt of cable so
                        informing me. It was necessary to do that in order to give the Russian
                        people a clear understanding of what the United States had done, as
                        otherwise they would have thought we had declared war, and if so there would
                        have been a demonstration in front of the Embassy which I should have been
                        compelled to address. I talked at great length to the representatives of the
                        press all during Sunday Feb. 4th, and after the receipt of the cables sent
                        for my information and giving the instructions that had been forwarded to
                        our missions in neutral countries, I was compelled to submit to second talks
                        of half an hour or more with each representative who had seen me before the
                        receipt of the cable and to whom I had been compelled to say that I could
                        make no statement whatever as I had received no official information that we
                        had severed diplomatic relations with Germany. Each newspaper man insisted
                        on the authenticity of the news and it was very difficult to explain why I
                        could not confirm it and consequently could give no expression on the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>The Russians are very much pleased with the stand we have taken and are
                        already beginning to treat us as Allies. The French are delighted also and
                        according to telegraphic reports there have been demonstrations of an
                        enthusiastic nature in Paris. I don’t like the position of England or rather
                        the British Embassy here. Neither the British Ambassador nor the French nor
                        the Italian has called nor have I met any one of them since Bernstorff was
                        given his passports—it seemed to me that it would not have been improper for
                        those Ambassadors to call and express gratification at least that our
                        diplomatic relations with the arch-enemy of their countries had been
                        severed. The Belgian Minister deBuisseret did call and expressed himself as
                        being much pleased with the stand we had taken. The Siamese Minister called
                        yesterday and stated that his Government had instructed him to ascertain
                        what reply the neutral countries had made or would make to the suggestions
                        of President Wilson that they take similar action to ours. I told him that
                        no official information had been received on the subject and that all I knew
                        concerning it was what had appeared through the public prints. He told me he
                        had called upon me first, but proposed to call upon the Ministers of the
                        other neutral countries and that when he left the Embassy he <pb n="322"
                            xml:id="pg_322" facs="0368"/>would go to the Norwegian Legation; I
                        requested him to phone me the result of his conference with Minister
                        Prebensen, which he did later and informed me that the Scandinavian
                        countries had come to no conclusion other than an agreement to confer and
                        make a joint reply. Meantime I had telephoned to the Chinese Minister and
                        called at his Legation where he informed me of the action taken by his
                        government. He seemed very much pleased thereat and I was exceedingly also.
                        I informed the Siamese Minister of the action taken by China and strongly
                        urged him to recommend his Government to do likewise—he about promised to do
                        so. You will observe from the editorial of the <hi rend="italic">Novoe
                            Vremya</hi> of today which I send by this pouch<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d156fn6">Not printed.</note> that the motives of China are
                        impugned from the Russian view-point and that this semi-official organ of
                        the Government states that it will be the policy of Russia to aid Japan in
                        being the heir to the German possessions in the East. It seems to me that we
                        should have some voice in that matter. I account for the luke-warmness if
                        not the opposition of the British Embassy in this way: England fears that
                        America by coming into the war will be too potential a factor in the
                        negotiations for peace. It may be however that the phlegmatic nature of the
                        Englishman has not yet realized what it means for America to sever
                        diplomatic relations with Germany, especially if such step should be
                        followed by a declaration of war, which under the circumstances seems to me
                        to be inevitable. The Allies should bear in mind that their united efforts
                        for two and a half years have been ineffective in bringing the Central
                        Empires to terms. They should also bear in mind that during that period,
                        while they had been weakened by the loss of millions of men and the
                        incurring of billions of debt, America has grown stronger not only in wealth
                        and manpower but has learned more about making munitions of war than it had
                        acquired during all the years of its existence. I must confess that I am not
                        pleased with the attitude of our English Cousins. As I have written you more
                        than once they dominate the situation in Russia. The French and the Italian
                        Ambassadors almost hesitate to give the time of day without consulting the
                        British Ambassador. British influence has permeated to such an extent
                        Government circles that it brought about the appointment of Sazonov as
                        Ambassador to St. James. Sazonov was removed from the Ministry of Foreign
                        Affairs mainly because he was supposed to be much under British influence.
                        There is no question about his being an able diplomat, nor is there any
                        doubt about his being exceedingly friendly to the English. I have written
                        you time and again how direct commerce with America is interfered with by
                            <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0369"/>British dictation and if I have
                        not written you that the people &amp; the commercial circles here both are
                        becoming restive under that domination, I certainly meant to do so. I do
                        recall however having written to either you or Polk that the Russians are
                        saying that if they were going to have a commercial master, there is no
                        reason why they should have changed from Germany especially when the change
                        has entailed such a great cost. It is true that England is financing Russia
                        and has the power to require an approval of how the money advanced should be
                        expended, and it must also be admitted that in doing so England is
                        exercising a right which any country or Government might be expected to
                        exercise under the circumstances. England should not forget however that she
                        is only able to finance Russia and the other Allies by the assistance she
                        gets from the United States. That assistance however will no doubt cease now
                        when there is a prospect of our having use for all of our money to prepare
                        ourselves and it may be that a realization or a fear of such a situation, is
                        the cause of England being so luke-warm in the face of the strong
                        probability of our declaring war against Germany.</p>
                    <p>The internal situation has quieted down somewhat since my last letter to you
                        on that subject. The note of the Emperor to the new Premier Golitzine
                        advising cooperation between the Government and the law-making bodies of the
                        Empire had a very good effect. There is a slumbering opposition however to
                        the influences controlling the Emperor, and if it were not that Russia is
                        engaged in a life-and-death struggle, it might assume more definite form,
                        and in fact “show its teeth”.</p>
                    <p>The Russian papers have contained several telegrams to the effect that there
                        will be a Coalition Administration in Washington in the event we should
                        engage in war. One telegram today stated that Elihu Root would be Secretary
                        of State and Theodore Roosevelt Secretary of the Navy. Of course I gave the
                        report no credence and trust I was right. I write by this pouch a gossipy
                        letter to Polk which I shall tell him to show you. I wrote Polk some time
                        ago asking him whether it was expected that Ambassadors would tender their
                        resignations at the expiration of the Administration but had no reply. Of
                        course I shall be pleased to tender mine if expected or if customary, but
                        otherwise I shall not do so and am moved to that course not so much by the
                        desire to remain here but by a conviction on my part that I can serve our
                        country quite as well here as anyone else. This may seem conceited but if I
                        felt otherwise I would be equally candid. My relations with the Government
                        are very friendly as I have written you and my relations with my Colleagues
                        in the diplomatic corps are likewise. Minister Pokrovski and his wife will
                        occupy seats in my loge at the ballet <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324"
                            facs="0370"/>this evening as will the Chinese Minister. About two weeks
                        ago I entertained at a dinner the Ministers of Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
                        Holland, Servia, China and Siam. I wrote about this last week but fear that
                        the pouch containing the letter will not be received for many weeks to
                        come.</p>

                        <p>I am this day in receipt of notice from the Agent of the Norwegian
                            steamers in Petrograd that service on that line has been resumed;
                            consequently I send a copy of this letter in the pouch that goes by that
                            route.</p>
                        <p>Last night there was a large banquet given at one of the principal
                            restaurants of this city by the British Colony to the English members of
                            the Allied Conference now in session here. Speeches were made by
                            Rodzianko, President of the Duma; by an Ex Russian Minister of War and
                            by a Russian Professor in Oxford University; also by Lord Milner, a
                            British General and a British Admiral. The main object of this banquet
                            appears to have been to cement the relations between England and Russia.
                            The British Ambassador, Sir George Buchanan spoke and proposed the
                            health of Sazonov who has recently been appointed Russian Ambassador to
                            St. James. Sazonov replied; the main subject of the speeches of both
                            Buchanan and Sazonov was, in addition to mutual expressions of
                            admiration, to felicitate Russia and England on the complete
                            understanding now existing between those countries and to express the
                            hope that the relations will become still closer. Each of these two
                            speakers stated that the other was a potential if not the main influence
                            in removing the misunderstanding so long existing between England and
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>It will require many banquets and other instrumentalities to remove the
                            prejudice existing in Russia against British influence or British
                            domination, which appears to become more distasteful from week to week
                            to the commercial interests of Russia.</p>

                        congratulated the Russian Government or people upon the establishment of

                        the enclosed despatch just received from Ambassador Francis. It causes me
                        serious concern. I wish we could do something to prevent the socialistic
                        element in Russia from carrying out any plan which would destroy the
                        efficiency of the Allied Powers.</p>
                    <p>My suggestion would be that a Commission, say of three men, be sent at once
                        to Russia, if agreeable to that Government, and that one of the
                        Commissioners be Samuel Gompers<note n="15" xml:id="d158fn1">President of
                            the American Federation of Labor.</note> who would have a very decided
                        influence with the labor element in Russia and prevent in a large measure, I
                        believe, the tendency of the socialists toward a separate peace with
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>From despatches we have received, as you know, the German socialists are
                        seeking to meet the Russian socialists, undoubtedly for the purpose of
                        influencing them to support a separate peace between Germany and Russia.</p>

                        commission to Russia has come to me from a number of quarters and I am
                        inclined to think that it would be a good plan to send one, and send it
                        practically at once.</p>
                    <p>The important, perhaps the all-important thing is the personnel. Men of large
                        view, tested discretion, and a sympathetic appreciation of just what it is
                        they have been sent over for are the sort we need; and it is necessary,
                        besides, that they should <hi rend="underline">look</hi> the part.</p>
                    <p>House has suggested a prominent Jew (Oscar Straus), a business man (Willard
                        Straight), a labor leader (Samuel Gompers), and an educator (Benjamin Ide
                        Wheeler). What do you think, and whom would you suggest? . . . Crane has
                        already gone to Russia and ought to be over there by this time, if his ship
                        has escaped the submarines. Professor Harper of Chicago is widely known and
                        trusted in Russia.</p>
                    <p>We must find the right men, and they must not all be Democrats,—need not any
                        of them be Democrats,—but should all be genuinely enthusiastic for the
                        success of the Russian revolution.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have your note of today
                        in relation to the suggested Russian Commission and have been thinking over
                        the personnel of such Commission. I think we may agree that Samuel Gompers
                        is as available a man as we could get. In regard to Oscar Straus I should
                        doubt very much the advisability of sending another Jew and I believe there
                        is a measure of danger in overplaying the Jew element. I do not think
                        Willard Straight is the man at all for the place and I doubt very much from
                        my acquaintance with Dr. Wheeler whether he would be suitable.</p>
                    <p>I should think we ought to have, in addition to a labor leader, such a man as
                        Doctor John R. Mott; a businessman like Cyrus McCormick <pb n="327"
                            xml:id="pg_327" facs="0373"/>or Harold [<hi rend="italic">Howard</hi>]
                        Elliott; a financier like Bertrand; and a lawyer of prominence.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Professor Harper of Chicago, I have heard from several different
                        sources that he is not as popular as I had supposed in Russia. I am
                        therefore afraid to advise his selection. Of course I assume Mr. Crane would
                        be joined to any Commission that might be sent.</p>
                    <p>As soon as you determine upon the make-up of the commission I will take it up
                        with the individuals if you so desire, or, possibly, it would be more
                        effective if you communicated directly with them.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have been thinking a
                        great deal about the personnel of the Russian Commission. I hope that in
                        your conference with him to-day you will find Mr. Root a real friend of the
                        revolution. If you do, the Commission that has framed itself in my mind
                        would be as follows:<list>
                            <item>Elihu Root, New York,</item>
                            <item>John R. Mott, New York,</item>
                            <item>Charles R. Crane,</item>
                            <item>Cyrus H. McCormick, Chicago,</item>
                            <item>Eugene Meyer, jr., New York,</item>
                            <item>S. R. Bertron, New York,</item>
                            <item>John F. Stevens, New York,</item>
                        </list> and a representative of Labour whom I would suggest that we choose
                        in this way: seek the advice of Mr. Gompers as to whom we could send whom
                        the Socialists over there would not regard as an active opponent of
                        Socialism. Gompers himself and the leaders immediately associated with him
                        are known to be pronounced opponents of Socialism and would hardly be
                        influential in the present ruling circles of labour at Petrograd. And yet we
                        shall have to be careful, if we are to send a real representative of
                        American Labour, not to send a Socialist.</p>

                        the Russian situation, I have been wondering whether it might not be well
                        for you to send to Prince Lvoff a message which would in reality be an
                        address to the Russian people, expressing the confidence of the American
                        people in the success of the democratic government which they have
                        established and of our very sincere desire to aid them in their struggle
                        against Germany.</p>
                    <p>I believe at the present time this would be a most helpful document to be
                        published throughout Russia because of the very high regard in which the
                        United States is held by the liberal element in Russia. Of course if it is
                        to be done at all it should be done at once as I believe the situation is
                        serious and the present Government needs support.</p>

                        Russian Chargé that his Government had cabled him as to this matter, and
                        that the belief that joint conferences were being held here without Russia
                        being a party was causing suspicion and a measure of offense. This
                        unfortunate and ill-founded attitude had been first aroused by the recent
                        conference between the premiers of Great Britain, France and Italy, to which
                        Russia was not invited.</p>

                        Council of National Defense is sending a R. R. Commission to Russia.</p>
                    <p>Very definite instructions to them will be necessary to avoid confusion &amp;
                        interference between them &amp; the President’s Commission. They will report
                        to different departments &amp; be under different instructions in the
                        ordinary course.</p>
                    <p>It is plain that we can’t have three bodies dealing with the Russian
                        Government at the same time—the regular Embassy the President’s Mission
                        &amp; the R. R. Commission.</p>
                    <p>The President’s mission must discuss the transportation subject with the
                        Russian Government for that is the most important of all &amp; if we cannot
                        talk about that we will be discredited &amp; of no account.</p>
                    <p>I suggest that the R. R. Commission be attached to the President’s commission
                        as expert advisers make preliminary reports to it for its information &amp;
                        make through it any communication which seems desirable to be made to the
                        Russian Government.</p>

                        no uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>I shall go to Washington in full time for final instructions but I understand
                        the R. R. men are to leave Wednesday.</p>

                            when the Railroad Commission and the commission under Mr. Root arrive in
                            Russia there will be, counting the American Embassy, three bodies in
                            that country conferring with the Russian Government on behalf of the
                            United States, it seems advisable to clearly define the functions of the
                            two commissions, in order that there may be no confusion in the mind of
                            the Russian Government, resulting in one commission or the other being
                            discredited by it.</p>
                        <p>I would be pleased, therefore, if, upon your arrival in Russia, you will
                            let it be known that your commission is subsidiary to the Root
                            Commission which is to follow, and that you stand in the relation of a
                            body of experts to assist the Root Commission in the accomplishment of a
                            special object, namely, aiding Russia to improve its transportation
                            facilities by supplying from the United States men and material for
                            constructing and operating certain railway lines of great importance to
                            Russia in carrying on the present war. Upon the arrival of the Root
                            Commission, therefore, you will report to it and carry out your
                            functions under the direction and leadership of Mr. Root.</p>

                        <p>I would be pleased, therefore, if, in your conferences with members of

                            necessary to discuss the objects of your mission, you would have your

                            supply of materials for the construction of railways, and the furnishing
                            of men to manage and operate the lines. As Mr. Root has the rank of
                            Ambassador and as his commission will deal with <pb n="331"

                            and thereafter to negotiate with the Russian Government in accordance

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I think that Mr. Root’s
                        mistake about the character and functions of the commission of railway
                        experts is a very natural one, but that it will be removed when Mr. Bertron
                        repeats to him a conversation he (Mr. B.) and I had this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>This is my understanding of the mission of the railway experts: It bears no
                        resemblance to that of the Commission of which Mr. Root is to act as
                        chairman. It is not going to ask What can the United States do for Russia?
                        but only to say We have been sent here to put our-selves at your disposal to
                        do anything we can to assist in the working out of your transportation
                        problem. They are to report nothing back to us. They are delegated to do
                        nothing but serve Russia on the ground, if she wishes to use them, as I
                        understand she does.</p>
                    <p>There would, therefore, be no propriety in making them subsidiary to the
                        Commission or in giving them any connection with it of any kind.</p>
                    <p>If this is not clear to all concerned, I will of course take any course that
                        may seem wise to make it clear.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>:I enclose translation of an
                        editorial from the Petrograd <hi rend="italic">Rjetch</hi> of April 14/27th
                        which is thought by some to reflect the personal views of Professor
                        Miliukoff the Minister of Foreign Affairs. You will observe it savors of
                        criticism of President Wilson in that he after advocating “a peace without
                        victory” now appears to join with the Allies in wishing a decisive victory.
                        Furthermore in mentioning the President’s declaration concerning territorial
                        questions it seems to draw the conclusion that the President classes
                        Constantinople and the Dardanelles with the German colonies <pb n="332"
                            xml:id="pg_332" facs="0378"/>in Africa to the neglect of Russia’s claims
                        to Constantinople. It asks what the President means by “all the principles
                        of international policy must be revised” and by “It is inevitable that all
                        nations should renounce their former outlook”. It also makes other
                        insinuations but none of the expressions would be important unless they were
                        thought to reflect the views of Minister Miliukoff. As I cabled the
                        Department on May 1st in my No. 1240,<note n="19" xml:id="d167fn1">
                            <ref target="frus1917Supp02v01#pg_52">

                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 52</ref>.</note> there has been what
                        threatened to become a serious difference in the Cabinet concerning the
                        foreign or annexation policy of Russia at the end of the war. Miliukoff has
                        favored Russia having Constantinople as was promised to the Imperial
                        Government by the Allies before the Revolution. Kerensky however advocates
                        the Dardanelles being neutral and free to all countries and is also opposed
                        to annexation to Russian territory after the close of the war—many of the
                        banners yesterday in the great Labor Parade contained inscriptions of “Peace
                        with Victory but without annexation or contribution”. I learned in
                        confidence yesterday that this difference in the Ministry had been adjusted
                        and that in the near future a formal declaration of what Russia’s objects
                        are in the war, would be made and I was given to understand that such
                        declaration would be against annexation of territory. The Ministry was said
                        to have been about equally divided on this question. Sir George Buchanan
                        told me a few days ago that he was not expressing any opinion on the subject
                        because the Allies had promised Constantinople to Russia before the
                        Revolution and when Russia’s policy regarding Constantinople was well
                        defined and well-known; he remarked however that he hoped or believed the
                        result would be that the Dardanelles would be neutral.</p>

                        <p>The above was dictated May 2d, since which time there have been a number
                            of important occurrences. On May 3rd or 4th, Miliukoff promulgated a
                            statement without consulting the Workingmen’s and Soldiers’ Committee,
                            and that statement aroused hostile demonstrations against Miliukoff,
                            notwithstanding it only reiterated the declaration of the provisional
                            Government of March 28/Apr. 10th. The offense seems to have been that
                            the Provisional Government presumed to make a statement without
                            consulting with and obtaining the consent of the Workingmen’s Committee.
                            In the midst of these hostile demonstrations, I called upon Miliukoff,
                            who was in a meeting of the Council of Ministers in the War Department
                            and told him and Goutchkoff in effect that having risked my judgment in
                            asking my Government to recognize the Provisional Government and having
                                <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0379"/>done all I could to assist
                            the Ministry, I felt considerable official and personal responsibility
                            concerning a stable Government in Russia and that if more satisfactory
                            evidence were not given of such Government, I should feel compelled to
                            advise my Government not to extend the aid which I had been continuously
                            recommending. Goutchkoff seemed very much pleased at the statement and
                            asked me if I would make it public, but before I could answer, Miliukoff
                            remarked that he trusted there would be no occasion for me to do so at
                            least none existed at that time. He said that he expected hostile
                            demonstrations against himself at the meeting of the Ministry to be held
                            that evening, May 3rd, at Marinsky Palace at 9 o’clock when there would
                            be a conference with the Executive Committee of the Workingmen’s
                            Committee; that his friends had desired to make a counter demonstration
                            but he had advised against it. The conference did take place and at
                            about 10 p. m. a large crowd including some soldiers in uniform and
                            armed appeared in front of the Markinsky Palace, but the friends of the
                            new government were there also and in larger numbers than its opponents.
                            In response to loud calls for Miliukoff, Nekrasoff, Minister of Ways and
                            Communications, appeared and addressed the crowd stating that the
                            Government was confident of its position and would continue to direct
                            affairs according to its best lights; that Miliukoff was in the meeting
                            and was at that minute engaged in conference but would address the
                            assemblage in a few minutes. Miliukoff appeared soon thereafter and was
                            given an ovation; he spoke with more confidence and firmness than on
                            previous occasions and was very much gratified at the reception his
                            remarks met with. On his return to the Foreign Office after midnight, he
                            found a crowd assembled there and made another talk. How much influence
                            my talk with the Ministers had upon their assuming for the first time a
                            rather independent position I cannot say but the report has gained
                            circulation and credence that the stand taken by the Ministry was
                            inspired if not demanded by the American Ambassador. I give you this for
                            what it is worth and must rely upon your knowledge of my discretion in
                            whatever I did or said. It seemed to me there was a crisis in the
                            situation and I endeavored to meet it in the most effective manner. The
                            following day, Friday, the hostile demonstrations continued for a few
                            hours; in fact I passed one of these demonstrations on the Nevsky where
                            there was a procession of workingmen, some of whom were armed and there
                            was one black flag with an inscription anarchistic in tone. I
                            communicated with Miliukoff by phone congratulating him on his success
                            in the previous evening and was informed by him that an agreement had
                            been reached with the Workingmen’s Committee which would be promulgated
                            within a few hours. As the day <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0380"
                            />wore on, friends of the new government and opponents of the
                            anarchistic and extremely socialistic expressions of Lenin gained
                            courage to such an extent that whenever a Lenin banner appeared on the
                            streets it was captured and torn into shreds. On Friday evening late it
                            became known that an agreement had been reached and the Saturday morning
                            papers contained an explanatory note from the new government and also a
                            proclamation from the Workingmen’s Committee advising its friends to
                            refrain from congregating in crowds and from carrying arms. That
                            proclamation contained only one objectionable paragraph and that was a
                            statement that no troops other than the small squads for police duty
                            could appear upon the streets without the written consent of the
                            Workmen. The result however was that the streets have been extremely
                            quiet since Friday night; the Provisional Government expresses great
                            satisfaction with the situation and [is] entirely confident in the
                            observance of its authority. I have cabled these developments from day
                            to day. This despatch may not reach you for several weeks and will of
                            course be stale when read. Changes follow each other with great
                            rapidity. The effect of our prompt and first recognition of this
                            government is still being felt and in my judgment the American Embassy
                            is respected to a greater extent and has more influence with the
                            Provisional Government and with the people generally than any other
                            mission in Russia. I am giving you not only my personal convictions but
                            the opinion of all so far as I am acquainted therewith.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>. . . There are still a great many tons of supplies on the Eastern Border
                            of Russia awaiting transportation into the country; if the same is
                            granted by the new Government it will be attributable to the work we
                            have hitherto performed and to the fact that the new Government is more
                            considerate of human suffering than was the old. At the same time, no
                            government can be blamed for refusing to transport supplies to prisoners
                            of an enemy country if such accommodation jeopardizes its own defense.
                            In other words the great congestion in freight existing on the Eastern
                            Border of Russia must be relieved gradually, and the instinct of
                            self-preservation will prompt the government to give precedence to its
                            own necessities. I am much pleased that John F. Stevens is coming to
                            Vladivostok to take charge of the terminals and I hope to be able to
                            persuade the Government to extend his jurisdiction into the interior of
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>This situation is interesting to a degree and I could write at much
                            greater length but have not the time to do so even if I thought you had
                            the patience to read my detailed statement concerning conditions.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Editorial From the Petrograd “Rjetch” of April 14/27,
                                1917</hi>.</head>
                        <p>The Press has published declarations apparently made by President Wilson
                            to Balfour, the head of the English Mission which has arrived in
                            America. The full text of the declaration is unknown and the
                            communications in the papers cause some doubt as to whether the
                            declaration has been correctly reproduced. In any case the general trend
                            of the declaration is probably correct as it corresponds with Wilson’s
                            point of view concerning the problems of the war and in particular the
                            problem of the future peace. President Wilson categorically declares a
                            statement which can only be welcomed—that for humanity a lasting peace
                            is of much greater importance than a peace concluded immediately with
                            militaristic Germany. In other words, the President of the United States
                            after rejecting “a peace without victory” fully joins in the views of
                            the allies, that only a decisive victory can give a durable peace.</p>
                        <p>But what does he consider such a victory to be? Wilson’s reply to this
                            question in the text given by the papers is very incomplete. Is the
                            restitution of Alsace-Lorraine to the French necessary for a durable
                            peace? The President replies that this question “is beyond the sphere of
                            the international interests of America”. He holds precisely the same
                            view concerning the question of Germany’s colonies in South Africa,
                            which for an unknown reason he places in the same category as the
                            question of Alsace-Lorraine. After Wilson’s declaration that the United
                            States does not intend to take a stand on these questions any more than
                            on “the other territorial questions” (the press does not say which
                            territorial questions are meant), it becomes impossible to understand
                            his declaration in its entirety to the effect that owing to America’s
                            entering the war “all the principles of international policy must be
                            revised” and that “it is inevitable that all nations should renounce
                            their former outlook”. So simplified a view of the problems of
                            international diplomacy would of course greatly simplify America’s
                            problems. She would not have to consider which European <pb n="336"
                                xml:id="pg_336" facs="0382"/>agreements she would enter and which
                            she would not. In substance it is not yet known whether America is a
                            party to the allies’ agreement not to conclude a separate peace. Under
                            these conditions the announcement of the papers that there is to be a
                            formal diplomatic “conference” in Washington seems inaccurate or at
                            least premature. We know nothing of the participation in this conference
                            of the other allies besides the British and French missions which happen
                            to be now in America.</p>
                        <p>With all his precaution concerning the questions “which do not concern”
                            America, President Wilson made an exception for one of them,—the
                            question of the Straits. He fears to take a stand concerning
                            Alsace-Lorraine. Just as carefully he avoids possible English claims.
                            But on the probable settlement of the question of Constantinople, Wilson
                            considers it possible to express himself freely. In addition he alters
                            his former point of view to our disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>We would not like to think that there is expressed here a supposition,
                            quite unfounded assuredly, concerning the weakening of Russia’s role
                            among the allies. We will not raise the question of the Straits in
                            particular, but in any case the attitude toward this question should be
                            the same as toward “the other territorial questions which do not concern
                            America”.</p>
                        <p>These objections excepted, we fully endorse the humanitarian efforts of
                            President Wilson to conclude an “eternal peace”. This problem must
                            unquestionably be taken seriously. But as we have already had occasion
                            to say more than once, the solution of the problem is indissolubly bound
                            to those results of the decisive victory, which Wilson on the one hand
                            will not consent to discuss, and on the other hand—with regard to
                            Russia’s vital interests—discusses too carelessly.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Root</hi>: I took the first opportunity to
                        lay before the President your letter of the 6th in regard to the Commission
                        of Railroad Experts.</p>
                    <p>The President said that he had had a talk with Mr. Bertron who would
                        doubtless repeat it to you which explained the provinces of the respective
                        commissions.</p>
                    <p>His purpose is that the Railroad Commissioners are not going for the purpose
                        of asking how the United States can aid Russia, but to put themselves at the
                        disposal of the Russian Government to assist <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"
                            facs="0383"/>in solving the transportation problem, that is, they are
                        delegated to do nothing but serve Russia on the ground.</p>
                    <p>In view of this particular field of service the President feels that it would
                        be unwise to make the Railroad Commission subsidiary to your commission,
                        which is essentially political in character. This would of course not debar
                        conferences between the two commissions if it seemed advisable, although
                        necessity would not appear to require them except of a most informal
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>I can talk this matter over with you more fully when you come to Washington,
                        which I hope will be soon, although one member of the Commission is still
                        unnamed because of certain difficulties in finding the one best qualified. I
                        will, however, advise you as soon as the list is complete and arrangements
                        made for personnel and departure.</p>
                    <p>From every side I hear the strongest commendation of your willingness to
                        serve as the head of this Commission. The only discordant note is from the
                        pro-German element who dread your influence. As one man said to me today,
                        “The best evidence of the wisdom of selecting Mr. Root is the character of
                        those who oppose him.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>It would seem that certain phrases uttered by you are being used by the
                        radical socialists (probably under German influence) to force the
                        Provisional Government to declare a policy which will remove the chief
                        incentive to Russian offensive operations, namely, control of the
                        Dardanelles and possession of Constantinople. It is an adroit scheme to
                        advance argument of what is the use of Russia continuing the war and why
                        should she not make a separate peace, if neither in territory nor in
                        indemnity she can be compensated for the enormous expenditure of life and
                        money which a vigorous prosecution of the war will entail.</p>
                    <p>It is an insidious and ingenious plan to win over the Russian people to the
                        idea of a separate peace, which seems to me a very real danger and one that
                        ought to be avoided, if possible.</p>
                    <p>Cannot some interpretation of the language, which is being used, be given
                        which will remove the idea so industriously circulated in Russia before it
                        has gone too far to counteract the effect?</p>
                    <p>Of course the only way in which that can be done is by a message from you to
                        Francis for the Russian Government and for publication in Russia. I realize
                        the difficulty of doing this, but the harm which is being done seems to me
                        very great. It may cost this country millions of men if this movement for a
                        separate peace cannot be checked. I feel that every day that the argument
                        remains unanswered increases the peril.</p>

                        of the Diplomatic Mission with him to stop in Japan on their return to the
                        United States. We are informed that they are leaving Petrograd about the 9th
                        of this month. The present unrest in the Far East and the possible
                        divergence of views of Mr. Root as to the policy of this Administration in
                        regard to that region seems to me to make it unwise for him to represent the
                        Government. If it is advisable to send a mission to Japan I think we should
                        pursue the course of sending new men directly from the United States.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In a conversation which I
                        had with Mr. Root at luncheon on the 9th he asked me if I had seen the
                        address issued by the Stevens Commission. I said that I had not. The
                        following day he sent me a copy which I enclose.</p>
                    <p>I fear Mr. Stevens is assuming an authority and giving the Commission a
                        diplomatic character which neither possess. I call your particular attention
                        to the portion of the address marked in red,<note n="24" xml:id="d173fn1"
                            >Fifth paragraph, sentence beginning “To the end that.”</note> by which

                        a pledge he had no power to make.</p>
                    <p>The pledge having been given I think that it would be unwise to repudiate it
                        as the Russian people and Russian Government might misconstrue any
                        repudiation of the Commission’s promise. At the same time it would seem
                        advisable I think for Stevens to be told, preferably by you as the
                        Commission is not a diplomatic one, that he has no authority to carry on
                        negotiations or enter into agreements for the United States.</p>

                        <p>The United States Railway Advisory Commission is accredited by the State
                            Department of the United States to its ally Russia. The object of the
                            Commission is, as has been stated, to advise with and to assist in every
                            practicable way in the handling of the grave transportation problems
                            which the war against a common enemy has thrust upon the railways of
                            Russia. It seems fitting that upon this, the anniversary of our natal
                            day of Independence, this Commission should convey to the people of
                            Russia a message declaring not only its purpose but also something as to
                            what it has accomplished and which it is believed will cheer the nation
                            and convince it that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with
                            its great ally in the prosecution to a successful conclusion of the war
                            against the venomous enemy of democratic freedom.</p>
                        <p>The Commission has been in Russia about five weeks. During this time it
                            has met with the officials of the Russian Railways and has discussed
                            fully and freely the various problems confronting the railways. It has
                            been met everywhere and at all times with the utmost spirit of
                            cordiality and cooperation on the part of those officials. It has found,
                            what was no surprise to it, that as masters of technique the Russian
                            railway officials have no superiors in the world. It has found that in
                            many ways their practices are among the best and that from a basic
                            standpoint the Russian railways are intrinsically sound—backed as they
                            are by the enormous latent resources and the vast population of this
                            wonderful country. At the same time, it believes that a judicious
                            mingling of the best Russian and American railway practices will be of
                            great benefit to the railways of Russia, and in this belief your
                            officials are in hearty accord and have given their approval to the
                            following suggestions made by this Commission.</p>
                        <p>An improved system of train operation, a better divisional organization,
                            whereby closer supervision can be maintained, and a revision of engine
                            runs whereby a greater capacity of each engine and car can be obtained,
                            resulting in an improvement in the movement of traffic. The construction
                            of locomotive erecting shops at Vladivostok where the immense number of
                            locomotives coming from the United States can be erected and put into
                            service much more speedily than has been the practice heretofore.</p>
                        <p>The working day and night of all locomotive repair shops so that the
                            great number of out of repair locomotives may be reduced and <pb n="341"
                                xml:id="pg_341" facs="0387"/>that they may be put into service where
                            they are so urgently needed. That the “per diem” rate, or charges of one
                            railway against another for the use of cars, be doubled, and that also
                            the charge for holding cars for loading or unloading be doubled. This to
                            insure prompt handling and release of cars in a reasonable time. That a
                            Supply Department under a General Storekeeper be installed, who shall be
                            responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the vast amount of
                            material and supplies needed for the operation and maintenance of the
                            roads, the duties of such officer to include the reclamation of worn
                            material and the reissuing of such as may be found serviceable.</p>
                        <p>But the great imperative immediate necessity which confronts the railways
                            of Russia to enable them not only to maintain its armies at the front,
                            but also to support in comfort its civil population, who equally with
                            its soldiers are fighting the great battle for freedom, is a great
                            increase in the number of locomotives and freight cars. On this point
                            the Commission are entirely in accord with the railway officials and
                            with the Russian people. To the end that this absolutely necessary want
                            shall be supplied as quickly as can be done, this Commission has cabled
                            the Administration at Washington advising the immediate construction of
                            2500 locomotives and 40,000 freight cars to be added to the equipment of
                            the Russian railways. This means, of course, an extension of credit by
                            the United States to Russia of some 750,000,000 millions [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>] of roubles. This matter has no commercial
                            aspect for the Commission has pledged what to it is dearer than family
                            or life itself, the good faith and honor of its country.</p>
                        <p>The Commission has under further consideration the furnishing of raw
                            material, tools and shop machinery to any extent that may be found
                            advisable after careful consideration with the Russian officials, and
                            stands ready to aid [with] its advice and counsel in any and all matters
                            it may be requested.</p>
                        <p>In closing it desires to express its hearty appreciation of the aid given
                            it by the efficient Minister of Ways of Communication and his staff of
                            able assistants. It knows that in their hands the future of the Russian
                            railways is secure and it believes with the aid and material assistance
                            which the United States is giving to its great Ally, that Russia will
                            continue to sustain its part in the desperate struggle for freedom which
                            is now convulsing the World.</p>

                        attention already to the extraordinary action of Mr. Stevens but I thank you
                        for sending me a full copy of Mr. Stevens’ proclamation which I herewith
                        return.</p>
                    <p>Will you not be kind enough to have the following cable sent to Mr.
                        Stevens:</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“The President appreciates very highly what Mr. Stevens and his
                            associates are doing in Russia but thinks it wise to remind Mr. Stevens
                            that it is important that the impression should not be created that he
                            and his associates represent or speak for the Government of the United
                            States. As the President explained to the Commission before they
                            started, they were sent abroad merely to put themselves at the service
                            of the Russian Government. Any assurances conveyed to the Russian
                            people, therefore, as if authoritatively by the Commission would be a
                            very grave mistake. The President does not wish in this way to discredit
                            assurances already given but merely to convey a very friendly caution
                            for the future.”<note n="26" xml:id="d174fn1">This message was sent Aug.

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have been considering the
                        Russian situation and, although our information is meager and to an extent
                        confusing, I have reached the following conclusions:<list>
                            <item>That the Bolsheviki are determined to prevent Russia from taking
                                further part in the war.</item>
                            <item>That the longer they continue in power the more will authority in
                                Russia be disorganized and the more will the armies disintegrate,
                                and the harder it will become to restore order and military
                                efficiency.</item>
                            <item>That the elimination of Russia as a fighting force will prolong
                                the war for two or three years, with a corresponding demand upon
                                this country for men and money.</item>
                            <item>That with Bolsheviki domination broken the Russian armies might be
                                reorganized and become an important factor in the war by next spring
                                or summer.</item>
                            <item>That the hope of a stable Russian Government lies for the present
                                in a military dictatorship backed by loyal disciplined
                                troops.</item>
                            <item>That the only apparent nucleus for an organized movement
                                sufficiently strong to supplant the Bolsheviki and establish a
                                government would seem to be the group of general officers with
                                General Kaledin, the hetman of the Don Cossacks.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>These conclusions present the problem as to whether we ought to take any
                        steps to encourage the Kaledin party, and if so the nature of those
                        steps.</p>
                    <p>I think that we must assume that Kaledin and his Cossacks know less about us
                        and our attitude than we know about them, that through Bolshevik and German
                        sources they are being furnished with false information and very probably
                        have been told that we have recognized the Bolshevik Government and so are
                        coming to the conclusion that further resistance is useless. Of course to
                        have this <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0390"/>group broken up would be
                        to throw the country into the hands of the Bolsheviki and the Germans could
                        freely continue their propaganda which is leading to chaos and the actual
                        disintegration of the Russian Empire.</p>
                    <p>A possible way of checking this is to get a message through to Kaledin
                        (probably via Tiflis and courier) telling the true state of affairs, and
                        non-recognition of the Bolsheviki and our readiness to give recognition to a
                        government which exhibits strength enough to restore order and a purpose to
                        carry out in good faith Russia’s international engagements.</p>
                    <p>Whether such a communication is advisable is, I think, worthy of
                        consideration, but if it is to be sent it ought to be done without delay as
                        I am convinced that German intrigues and Bolshevik false representations
                        will speedily impair the morale of Kaledin’s followers unless something is
                        done to give them hope that they will, if their movement gains sufficient
                        strength, receive moral and material aid from this Government. It seems to
                        me that nothing is to be gained by inaction, that it is simply playing into
                        the Bolsheviki’s hands, and that the situation may be saved by a few words
                        of encouragement, and the saving of Russia means the saving to this country
                        of hundreds of thousands of men and billions of dollars. I do not see how we
                        could be any worse off if we took this course because we have absolutely
                        nothing to hope from continued Bolshevik domination.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Kaledin and the Russian generals, Alexieff, Brousiloff and
                        Korniloff, who appear to be with him or about to join him, I have inquired
                        of Major Washburne, who knew them personally and more or less intimately.
                        From him I gained the following:</p>
                    <p>Kaledin is a man of ponderous determination, who is unaffected alike by
                        victory or defeat. He is a strong character who carried through his purposes
                        regardless of opposition. As a commander he resembles Grant. He radiates
                        force and mastery.</p>
                    <p>Alexieff is a modest, quiet man, but the most skillful strategist in Russia,
                        if not in any of the allied countries. He listens patiently, talks little
                        and reaches his decisions alone.</p>
                    <p>Brousiloff is the most brilliant general in the Russian armies and arouses
                        the enthusiasm of the soldiers and his subordinates by his ability and
                        forceful personality. As a strategist he is only second to Alexieff. While
                        Kaledin is a man of the people, Brousiloff is of the aristocracy.</p>
                    <p>Korniloff is not the equal of any one of the three other generals in military
                        skill or in personal popularity with the troops. He has, however,
                        considerable influence with soldiers recruited in Siberia and Turkestan.</p>
                    <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0391"/>
                    <p>The foregoing indicates the elements of strength in the military group which
                        seem to be gathering about Kaledin, and which will in all probability obtain
                        the support of the Cadets and of all the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>
                        and the land-owning class.</p>
                    <p>I would like to talk this matter over with you after Cabinet meeting tomorrow
                        if that meets your convenience.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                                Treasury and delegate of the Treasury to the Inter-Allied Council on
                                War Purchases and Finance.</note> The Russian situation has been
                            carefully considered and the conclusion has been reached that the
                            movement in the south and southeast under the leadership of Kaledine and
                            Korniloff offers at the present time the greatest hope for the
                            reestablishment of a stable government and the continuance of a military
                            force on the German and Austrian fronts. While there can be no certainty
                            of the success of Kaledine it is not improbable that he may succeed.
                            From Moscow and Tiflis come very favorable reports as to the strength of
                            the movement and as to the weakening power of the Bolsheviki.</p>
                        <p>In view of the policy being pursued by Lenine and Trotsky which if
                            continued will remove Russia as a factor in the war and may even make
                            her resources available to the Central Powers, any movement tending to
                            prevent such a calamity should be encouraged even though its success is
                            only a possibility.</p>
                        <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>It would seem unwise for this Government to support openly Kaledine and
                            his party because of the attitude which it seems advisable to take with
                            the Petrograd authorities, but it is felt that the Kaledine group should
                            be shown that the Allied Governments are most sympathetic with his
                            efforts. Without actually recognizing his group as a <hi rend="italic"
                                >de facto</hi> government, which is at present impossible since it
                            has not taken form, this Government cannot under the law loan money to
                            him to carry forward his movement. The only practicable course seems to
                            be for the British and French Governments to finance the Kaledine
                            enterprise in so far as it is necessary, and for this Government to loan
                            them the money to do so. In that way we would comply with the statute
                            and at the same time strengthen a movement which seems to present the
                            best possibility of retaining a Russian army in the field.</p>
                        <p>You will, after conferring with the Ambassador, take this matter up with
                            the proper British and French authorities having charge of financial
                            matters and report as soon as possible their views and whether or not
                            they are willing to adopt the course above outlined and if so, to what
                            extent financial aid will be required.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that this matter relates to credits to foreign
                            governments and at the suggestion of Secretary McAdoo, who approves of
                            the policy, I am addressing this telegram to you directly assuming that
                            you will before taking the matter up with representatives of Great
                            Britain and France confer with the Ambassador as to the politic course
                            to pursue.</p>
                        <p>I need not impress upon you the necessity of acting expeditiously and
                            with impressing those with whom you talk of the importance of avoiding

                            for the Kaledine movement, much less of providing financial
                            assistance.</p>

                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 405</ref>.</note> impresses me with
                        the adroitness of the author whose presentation of peace terms may well
                        appeal to the average man, who will not perceive the fundamental errors on
                        which they are based.</p>
                    <p>The address from beginning to end is to a class and not to all classes of
                        society, a class which does not have property but hopes <pb n="347"
                            xml:id="pg_347" facs="0393"/>to obtain a share by process of government
                        rather than by individual enterprise. This is of course a direct threat at
                        existing social order in all countries.</p>
                    <p>In the second place the address discusses the rights of nationalities (though
                        it does not use the term) without defining what a nationality is, and at the
                        same time advances doctrines which make class superior to the general
                        conception of nationality. Is the Bolshevik idea of nationality based upon
                        blood, habitation of a particular territory, language, or political
                        affinity? Accurate definition of the word is necessary to interpret the
                        terms proposed, otherwise they are too vague to be intelligently
                        considered.</p>
                    <p>If the Bolsheviks intend to suggest that every community (though they state
                        no unit as a basis for independent action) can determine its allegiance to
                        this or that political state or to become independent, the present political
                        organization of the world would be shattered and the same disorder would
                        generally prevail as now exists in Russia. It would be international
                        anarchy.</p>
                    <p>Though founded entirely on the assertion of legality, the right of
                        communities within a constituted federal union to determine their allegiance
                        was denied by the Government of the United States in 1861 and the denial was
                        enforced by military power. We, as a nation, are therefore committed to the
                        principle that a national state may by force if necessary prevent a portion
                        of its territory from seceding without its consent especially if it has long
                        exercised sovereignty over it or if its national safety or vital interests
                        would be endangered.</p>
                    <p>I can see that, where a particular region lies between the territories of two
                        nations which the world has recognized as sovereign states, there may justly
                        arise the question as to which nation should incorporate the region into its
                        territory and that the decision may properly rest with the inhabitants of
                        the region, but I do not see that the same question arises in the event that
                        the inhabitants of a territory already under the sovereignty of a nation
                        have the same right to become an independent state and to be admitted into
                        the family of nations by a mere expression of popular will. Such a theory
                        seems to me utterly destructive of the political fabric of society and would
                        result in constant turmoil and change. It simply cannot be done if social
                        order and governmental stability are to be maintained.</p>
                    <p>The suggestions of the Bolsheviks in regard to Ireland, India, and other
                        countries which have been and are integral parts of recognized powers are in
                        my opinion utterly untenable if it is desirable to preserve the present
                        concept of sovereign states in international relations. However justified
                        may be the principle of local self-government, the necessities of preserving
                        an orderly world require <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0394"/>that there
                        should be a national authority with sovereign rights to defend and control
                        the communities within the national boundaries.</p>
                    <p>It is apparent, as I said at the outset, that the Bolsheviks are appealing in
                        this address to a particular class of society, which they seek to arouse
                        against the present order of things, enticing them with the possible
                        abolition of the institution of private property and the possible control by
                        that class of accumulated wealth and of its distribution. The document is an
                        appeal to the proletariat of all countries, to the ignorant and mentally
                        deficient, who by their numbers are urged to become masters. Here seems to
                        me to lie a very real danger in view of the present social unrest throughout
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>Of course the enforcement of the will of the ignorant, indifferent to all
                        save their own pleasures, would be the worst form of despotism, especially
                        as that class has always been controlled by violent and radical leaders. It
                        would be a species of class-despot, which would have far less regard for
                        private rights than an individual despot. This seems to be the present
                        social program of the Bolsheviks, and they appear to be putting it into
                        operation in Russia. It is essentially anarchistic rather than socialistic
                        in character and will, wherever adopted, break down every semblance of
                        social order and public authority.</p>
                    <p>I think in considering this address it might properly be asked by what
                        authority the Bolsheviks assume the right to speak for the Russian people.
                        They seized the Government at Petrograd by force, they broke up opposition
                        in the army by disorganizing it, they prevented the meeting of the
                        Constituent Assembly chosen by the people because they could not control it,
                        they have seized the property of the nation and confiscated private
                        property, they have failed to preserve public order and human life, they
                        have acted arbitrarily without pretense of legality, in fact, they have set
                        up over a portion of Russia a despotic oligarchy as menacing to liberty as
                        any absolute monarchy on earth, and this they maintain by force and not by
                        the will of the people, which they prevent from expression.</p>
                    <p>In view of present conditions I believe it would be unwise to make reply to
                        this insidious address; but, if it seems advisable not to ignore it, I think
                        the only course should be to state frankly the false premises upon which it
                        is based and the vagueness of the unit of independent communal power which
                        they propose to set up. In view of the threat against existing governments
                        and the promised aid to revolutionists I would personally prefer to see the
                        communication unanswered whatever the consequences might be. Lenine, Trotsky
                        and their colleagues are so bitterly hostile to the present social order in
                        all countries that I am convinced nothing could be said which would gain
                        their favor <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0395"/>or render them amenable
                        to reason. I feel that to make any sort of reply would be contrary to the
                        dignity of the United States and offer opportunity for further insult and
                        threats, although I do not mean that it may not be expedient at some time in
                        the near future to state our peace terms in more detail than has yet been
                        done.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: You will recall that after
                        Cabinet meeting Tuesday you suggested, upon reading a memorandum<note n="32"
                            xml:id="d179fn1">No copy filed with this letter.</note> which I showed
                        you in regard to our attitude toward Russia, that it would be well to draft
                        a telegram to Francis which could be, through unofficial channels,
                        transmitted to the Bolshevik Government.</p>
                    <p>I considered the matter and consulted with Mr. Polk on the subject and we
                        both reached the conclusion that the object would not be as well attained by
                        a telegram of that sort as it would for me to issue a public statement of
                        our attitude here and let Mr. Creel transmit it to Russia to his
                        representatives there and we send it to Francis for his information. In that
                        way it would obtain greater publicity and would, I think, accomplish every
                        purpose that could be accomplished by unofficially delivering it to the
                        Bolshevik Government, which would have a measure of danger and might cause
                        irritation—while a statement would not.</p>
                    <p>I therefore drafted a proposed statement and would be glad to have your views
                        as to this method of stating our attitude, and also as to the language of
                        the statement.</p>
                    <p>I am leaving tomorrow noon, as I told you, for New York and will return
                        Sunday night. Possibly by that time you will have had the opportunity to
                        pass upon the statement.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>In view of the fact that there seems to be some confusion in the public
                            mind as to the attitude of this Government in regard to the present
                            Russian situation it seems to me advisable to make at this time a
                            statement upon the subject.</p>
                        <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>Although Russia appears at the present time to be separated or to be
                            separating into distinct political groups, each of which claims
                            authority over a portion of the territory of the nation, the Government
                            of the United States is convinced that the spirit of democracy continues
                            to dominate the entire Russian nation. With that spirit the United
                            States feels a profound sympathy and believes in the ultimate effect of
                            its cohesive power upon the Russian people as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The separate independent authorities functioning in different sections of
                            Russia present a situation to the Government of the United States which
                            causes it to pause before formally recognizing any one of those
                            authorities as the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government of the
                            Russian nation. The evidence of the possession of a right to exercise
                            sovereignty over all Russia by a particular group of citizens must be
                            substantially conclusive before recognition, otherwise a foreign
                            government might reasonably be charged with exercising through
                            recognition an influence in favor of a group and with improperly
                            interfering with the internal political affairs of Russia.</p>
                        <p>In applying this principle the Government of the United States awaits the
                            full manifestation of the will of the Russian people because it is
                            convinced that it is its imperative duty to avoid any interference or
                            any appearance of interference with the domestic affairs of Russia,
                            denying at the same time that the adoption of this course is in any way
                            influenced by partiality for or opposition to any particular group or
                            body. The determination of an agency to exercise the sovereign power of
                            the nation belongs wholly and solely to the Russian people. As to that
                            they ought to be supreme. With the popular determination of the
                            governmental agency of all the Russian nation the United States, in
                            accordance with its conception of independence and national sovereignty,
                            has nothing and will have nothing to do. When undoubted proofs of the
                            will of the Russian people are manifest the Government of the United
                            States will gladly recognize the agents of the sovereign people of
                            Russia as the Russian Government and enter into relations with that
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Even while the question of the governmental agency remains undecided the
                            United States, appreciating the dominance of the democratic spirit in
                            Russia and inspired by the most friendly and unselfish motives, is
                            desirous of rendering such aid as it is able, provided its aid is
                            acceptable to the Russian people, to relieve their reported needs which
                            have unavoidably arisen out of the social and industrial disorganization
                            consequent upon a radical change in political institutions.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>The United States has only the kindliest feelings for Russia. Its policy
                            as to recognition or non-recognition of a government at the present time
                            is founded on the principle that the Russian people are sovereign and
                            have the right to determine their own domestic organization without
                            interference or influence by other nations. Its desire to aid the people
                            of Russia rests solely upon the fraternal spirit which it possesses for
                            a great democracy which has endured so much in its struggle against
                            autocracy both within and without its borders.</p>

                        memoranda from you in regard to matters in the Department. Among them was

                        I sent you the draft of a telegram on this subject to our Ambassador in
                        Tokio, which you approved, and it was forwarded on Sunday, the

                            xml:id="pg_352" facs="0398"/>you feel that further action is necessary?
                        It seems that until we hear from Morris this might be enough.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I should mention that a Mr. H. Fessenden Meserve, an
                        American citizen, who is a representative of the National City Bank of New
                        York in Moscow, asked for an interview with you and was referred to this
                        Department. He called today and told me he had a personal message for you
                        from the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, and I took the liberty of
                        having him deliver the message to me in order to save your time. It is
                        interesting as bearing on the question under discussion. He said, in the
                        course of a long conversation, that the Japanese Minister asked him to see
                        you and to say that he hoped that this Government would not send troops to
                        Vladivostok or Harbin for the purpose of keeping order, as any such movement
                        on our part would create a very unfavorable impression in Japan. He urged
                        that the matter of keeping order and protecting life in Siberia should be
                        left entirely with the Japanese. The Japanese Minister did not go into any
                        details but rather intimated that if we did land troops the Japanese people
                        would feel that we were doing work which properly belonged to them.</p>

                            memorandum<note n="37" xml:id="d183fn1">Not enclosed with file copy of
                            this letter.</note> on Revolutions in Europe by Mr. William English
                        Walling with great interest and care, and throughout the reading I felt that
                            <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0399"/>Mr. Walling had a keen
                        appreciation of the forces which are menacing the present social order in
                        nearly every European country and which may have to be reckoned with even in
                        this country. It is really a remarkable analysis of the dangerous elements
                        which are coming to the surface and which are in many ways more to be
                        dreaded than autocracy; the latter is despotism but an intelligent
                        despotism, while the former is a despotism of ignorance. One, at least has
                        the virtue of order, while the other is productive of disorder and anarchy.
                        It is a condition which cannot but arouse the deepest concern.</p>
                    <p>I think that Mr. Walling’s views in regard to the Bolsheviks are helpful and
                        sound, and after reading them I am more than ever convinced that our policy
                        has been the right one and should be continued. In talking with the French
                        Ambassador yesterday about Russia he said that he considered our course had
                        been the wisest and that the other Governments had failed in dealing with
                        the situation.</p>
                    <p>We will soon have to face this proposed socialist meeting at Stockholm and
                        determine upon the attitude we should take in dealing with it. We must
                        decide whether or not we are to permit Americans to obtain passports to
                        attend the meeting there or anywhere else it may be held. The meeting of
                        this element of society, imbued with the idea of an international social
                        revolution, might become a very real menace to all existing forms of
                        government, democratic as well as monarchical. And yet, if we prevent
                        Americans from attending there is danger of seemingly confirming the charge
                        that this nation is controlled by a capitalistic class. I see no middle
                        course. No avoidance of a decision. I think that the subject ought to engage
                        our attention because we should have a very definite policy determined
                        before the time for action arrives.</p>
                    <p>I thank you for letting me see Mr. Walling’s memorandum which is most
                        instructive and of which I have taken the liberty to make a copy for future
                        reference and in order to give to it more critical study.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have had, this afternoon,
                        interviews with the British and French Ambassadors in relation to Japan’s
                        desire to occupy Siberia with a military force.</p>
                    <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0400"/>
                    <p>Lord Reading informed me that he had seen you and had given you a copy of a
                        secret telegram which he had received from Mr. Balfour and of which I
                        received a copy this morning and append to this letter.<note n="38"
                            xml:id="d184fn1">No enclosures with file copy of this letter.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The French Ambassador gave me the substance of a telegram which he had
                        received from his Foreign Office containing a summary of a telegram they had
                        received from their Ambassador at Tokio. This latter is to me of especial
                        interest in view of the avowal of Motono<note n="39" xml:id="d184fn2"
                            >Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs.</note> to declare publicly the
                        disinterestedness of Japan and also the pledge to carry on military
                        activities as far as the Ural mountains—that is, to the confines of Asia.
                        This memorandum I also enclose.</p>
                    <p>I also would call your attention to the enclosed telegram from Stevens, at
                        Yokohama, which may not have attracted your attention, but bears directly on
                        the present subject.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the matter with the French Ambassador, who was my first caller,
                        I told him that I fully appreciated the attitude of the Allied Governments
                        in regard to Japan and that it would appear Japan intended to act in any
                        event. If that was so it was merely a question as to whether it was better
                        to make Japan the mandatory of the other powers or to permit her to act
                        independently, as I doubted the advisability of protesting in case she sent
                        a military force into Siberia.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador asked me in case it was decided that Japan should act at the
                        request of the other powers whether the United States would be a party.</p>
                    <p>I told him I thought there was serious difficulty in the way—chiefly that
                        such an agreement as was proposed would amount to a treaty and that would
                        have to be submitted to the Senate, where there were several strongly
                        anti-Japanese Senators who would oppose it. I said further that in case
                        action was taken by the Allied Governments I felt we should not be asked to
                        take any part.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador seemed disappointed at first but he said finally that he fully
                        understood the difficulty and also the opinion which I urged that it was
                        better for us and more in accord with our general policy to not join in such
                        an agreement.</p>
                    <p>When Lord Reading called I told him substantially what I had told the French
                        Ambassador. He seemed to feel that in view of the telegram which the French
                        Ambassador had received a new phase was put upon the problem and that if
                        Japan was willing to make public such a declaration it might be the best
                        policy to make her the mandatory of the Allied Powers.</p>
                    <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0401"/>
                    <p>He said further that he fully agreed with my view as to the inadvisability of
                        an agreement on our part which would compel Senatorial consent.</p>
                    <p>Since we talked over this matter yesterday I do not know as the conditions
                        have materially changed, but certainly the French telegram has thrown a new
                        light upon it and I think we should carefully consider whether or not we
                        should urge the Allied Governments not to make Japan their mandatory.</p>
                    <p>My own belief is that Japan intends to go into Siberia anyway and that it
                        might be a restraint upon her if she should make a declaration such as
                        Motono proposed. So far as this government is concerned I think all that
                        would be required would be a practical assurance that we would not make
                        protest to Japan in taking this step.</p>
                    <p>As the whole matter is of vital importance and requires immediate action if
                        any is to be taken I would be gratified if you would give me your views and
                        guidance at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                    <p>The Government of the United States is made constantly aware at every turn of
                        events that it is the desire of the people of the United States that, while
                        cooperating with all its energy with its associates in the war in every
                        direct enterprise of the war in which it is possible for it to take part, it
                        should leave itself diplomatically free wherever it can do so without
                        injustice to its associates. It is for this reason that the Government of
                        the United States has not thought it wise to join the governments of the
                        Entente in asking the Japanese government to act in Siberia. It has no
                        objection to that request being made, and it wishes to assure the Japanese
                        government that it has entire confidence that in putting an armed force into
                        Siberia it is doing so as an ally of Russia, with no purpose but to save
                        Siberia from the invasion of the armies and intrigues of Germany and with
                        entire willingness to leave the determination of all questions that may
                        affect the permanent fortunes of Siberia to the Council of Peace.</p>

                        should not have done, but the letter from Francis I thought might require
                        immediate attention.</p>
                    <p>The British, French, Italian and Japanese called on me and discussed the
                        letter you wrote them just before you left. They all seemed to be quite
                        satisfied with the way that matter is being handled by the President.<note

                        to discuss the Siberian situation and was rather anxious that we should send
                        the telegram to Japan on Monday. Monday morning he called me up and told me
                        to wait until I heard from him again. Today he sent for me and gave me the
                        enclosed message to be sent to Tokyo.<note n="45" xml:id="d186fn5">

                        to communicate it to the British, French, and Italian. It is a change in our
                        position, but I do not know that it will materially affect the situation. I
                        argued the question with him a little, but he said he had been thinking it
                        over and felt that the second message was absolutely necessary. On reading
                        it you will probably see what influenced him, namely, the position of this
                        Government in the eyes of the democratic people of the world. The message
                        will be sent today and I shall make my rounds this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>I do not think the Japanese will be entirely pleased, but it is not a
                        protest, so they may accept it as merely advice and go ahead and do what
                        they want.</p>
                    <p>I hope you are having a good rest and not thinking about the office. I am
                        sorry to even bother you with this, but I know you are naturally anxious to
                        hear what is going on.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: If the reports, which
                        persist, that the military prisoners in Siberia are being organized under
                        German officers and have succeeded in occupying Irkutsk are confirmed, we
                        will have a new situation in Siberia which may cause a revision of our
                        policy. It would seem to me, therefore, that we should consider the problem
                        on the hypothesis that the reports are true and be prepared to act with
                        promptness.</p>
                    <p>The occupation of important points in eastern Siberia by a German military
                        force and the helpless state of the Russians to resist the extension of the
                        German power place the situation on an entirely different basis from the one
                        presented by the chaotic state caused by <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358"
                            facs="0404"/>quarreling Russian factions. The presence of the Germans
                        and the possibility of their control of Siberia becomes a real menace to the
                        peace of the Far East. The situation of Irkutsk is such that the Germans, if
                        masters of the place, might invade Manchuria and obtain control of the
                        Trans-Siberian Railway.</p>
                    <p>In view of these facts I do not see how Japan could be expected to refrain
                        from taking military measures to resist further extension of the German
                        power, nor do I think that we could reasonably oppose their resistance to
                        the German advance in that region. In fact I believe that in the
                        circumstances Japan will act whether we approve or not. Would it then be the
                        better policy to approve or to be in opposition to Japanese
                        intervention?</p>
                    <p>With the actual control by the Germans of so important a place as Irkutsk the
                        question of the moral effect upon the Russian people of an expedition
                        against the Germans is a very different thing from the occupation of the
                        Siberian Railway in order to keep order between contending Russian factions.
                        It would seem to be a legitimate operation against the common enemy. I do
                        not see how we could refuse to sanction such a military step.</p>
                    <p>The question presented, if intervention in Siberia seems advisable, is
                        whether Japan alone or the Powers arrayed against Germany acting jointly
                        should constitute the expeditionary force employed to overthrow the German
                        power. I think that we must concede that in any event the burden of this
                        task must fall upon Japan. No Power has forces available for this
                        undertaking sufficiently strong to be a real factor in achieving the end
                        desired. Furthermore Japan seems to be opposed to joint action. In the
                        circumstances are not Japan’s sensibilities more important than the
                        sensibilities of the Russian people?</p>
                    <p>If the reports turn out to be correct will we lose anything by making Japan
                        the mandatory of the Powers, and giving approval to her sending an
                        expeditionary force into Siberia to oust the Germans and to restore Russian
                        authority in that region?</p>
                    <p>Ought we not to adopt this policy in the event that Irkutsk is actually
                        controlled by the Germans?</p>
                    <p>I think that the situation requires careful consideration and a policy should
                        be adopted in advance because no time ought to be lost to meet and offset
                        the German activities in Siberia, if the reports prove to be correct.</p>

                    <p>The British Embassy have received a telegram from the Foreign Office, from
                        which it appears that the Bolshevist Government asked the United States
                        Ambassador in Russia for the services of American railway experts. The
                        American Ambassador accordingly sent for one hundred of the three hundred
                        American railway experts in the Far East to go to Vologda.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office point out that the transit westward of Siberian supplies
                        and of the stores of the Allies at Vladivostock and Archangel will [not?] be
                        facilitated by any improvement which is made in the Russian railway system,
                        unless this is done under the control of the Allies.</p>
                    <p>The British Embassy are, therefore, instructed to call the attention of the
                        Department of State to this matter and to express the hope that great
                        circumspection will be used in the employment of the American engineers.</p>

                        (stripped of the confusions of the cables) would be a most welcome thing as
                        a support to my judgment in the premises.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have had another séance
                        with Lord Reading on the question of intervention in Russia, during which he
                        read to me the enclosed memoranda.<note n="49" xml:id="d193fn1">Two
                            memoranda conveying reports received by the British Foreign Office from
                            its representative in Moscow; not printed.</note> These I agreed to
                        submit to you.</p>
                    <p>In a previous interview I pointed out to him that the proposed intervention
                        in Russia had become divided into two problems, the Siberian and the
                        Murmansk, and that they seemed to me to require separate treatment; that the
                        question of intervention in Siberia depended upon the certainty of military
                        benefit which as yet was not evident; and that intervention by way of
                        Murmansk was different since it was a question of ability to land a
                        sufficient military force.</p>
                    <p>The British Ambassador, acting under instructions from his Government,
                        persists in seeking to have us unite with Great Britain and France in the
                        endeavor to obtain from Trotsky a request that we intervene on the condition
                        that we obtain from Japan a declaration that the territory occupied would be
                        restored to Russia without conditions after the war.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to Reading that this confusion of the two problems was
                        unfortunate, that I did not perceive how the conditional entry into Siberia
                        by a Japanese force had anything to do with the occupation of Murmansk and
                        the railway south, and that while intervention through the port of Murmansk
                        might be desirable, intervention through Vladivostok or Harbin was very
                        questionable in view of <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0407"/>the
                        inexpediency, if not the impossibility, of a Japanese force advancing
                        farther west than Irkutsk.</p>
                    <p>Lord Reading said that he had already advised his Government as to my
                        statement that the two problems were distinct and should be treated
                        separately, but that he had not had a reply.</p>
                    <p>I told him that I could see no objection to securing a request from Trotsky
                        that we should intervene via Murmansk, but that I was not at all sure we
                        would gain anything by a request as to a conditional Japanese intervention
                        in Siberia since to act upon such a request would array us against Semenoff
                        and the elements antagonistic to the Soviets. I said that if we took hold of
                        either one or the other horns of the dilemma we probably would find
                        ourselves in hot water.</p>
                    <p>In view of the present situation do you think it wise to advise Francis to
                        unite through unofficial channels in obtaining from Trotsky a request for us
                        to intervene by way of Murmansk? I do not feel that we should go further
                        than this at the present time and I am not sure that this is expedient in
                        view of the uncertainty of Trotsky’s power. To bring Japan into the question
                        seems to me to be unwise at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Will you please give me your opinion as to the course which should be
                        taken?</p>
                    <p>Since writing the foregoing I have received the enclosed telegram from
                        Ambassador Sharp.<note n="50" xml:id="d193fn2">Not printed.</note> Probably
                        you have also received a copy.</p>

                        by way of comment on these papers that I have not already said repeatedly.
                        The two parts of this question (as you properly discriminate them) must not
                        and cannot be confused and discussed together. Semenov is changing the
                        situation in Siberia very rapidly, apparently; and General March and the
                        Staff are clear and decided in their opinion that (1) no strong enough force
                        to amount to anything can be sent to Murmansk without subtracting just that
                        much shipping and man power from the western front, and (2) that such a
                        subtraction at the present crisis would be most unwise.</p>
                    <p>They believe, moreover, that there is no sufficient military force, in Japan
                        or elsewhere, to do anything effective in Siberia.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The very active propaganda
                        now being carried on in the press respecting the attitude of the
                        Administration towards Russia combined with the fact that Great Britain,
                        France, Italy and Japan, and indeed the Russian people, are eagerly awaiting
                        the announcement by the United States of a constructive plan for meeting the
                        present chaotic conditions in Russia leads me to make the following suggestions:<list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The creation of the “Commission for the Relief of Russia”. This
                                Commission to be organized generally along the same lines as the
                                “Commission for the Relief of Belgium”, except that all of the funds
                                required should be furnished for the time being at least out of your
                                War Fund. This would obviate the necessity of going to Congress for
                                the present for an appropriation.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>An announcement by you that in order to give some tangible
                                evidence to the world that the United States proposes to stand by
                                Russia and to assist the Russian people in the circumstances in
                                which they find themselves you had concluded to create this
                                Commission and to request Mr. Herbert Hoover to act as its head and
                                that the Commission would act in close conjunction with the State
                                Department and be guided in all questions of foreign policy by the
                                State Department.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>I feel sure that you will agree with me that unless the policy of such a
                        Commission is controlled through this Department, so far as it relates to
                        foreign affairs, hopeless confusion will result.</p>
                    <p>Your appointment of Mr. Hughes to assist the Department of Justice in its
                        Aircraft investigation effectively cleared up what bade fair to develop into
                        a most distressing situation. As I pointed out to you after Cabinet on
                        Tuesday, I see signs in Congress and outside of a similar situation arising
                        in connection with Russia unless you give concrete expression to the
                        splendid encouragement you have already extended to the Russian people. I
                        feel sure that Mr. Hoover’s appointment to head such a Commission would be
                        widely acclaimed as another evidence of the determination of the United
                        States to assist the Russian people towards the establishment of an orderly
                        Government independent of Germany.</p>
                    <p>The creation of this Commission would, for the time being, dispose of the
                        proposal of armed intervention. The British, French, Italian <pb n="363"
                            xml:id="pg_363" facs="0409"/>and Japanese Governments could be told that
                        armed intervention would have to depend on Mr. Hoover’s recommendations
                        after he had proceeded further with his work. Armed intervention to protect
                        the humanitarian work done by the Commission would be much preferable to
                        armed intervention before this work had been begun.</p>
                    <p>I know that you will hesitate to take Mr. Hoover from his present work. I
                        have learned, however, that the organization of the Food Administration has
                        proceeded to such an extent that, while much work remains to be done,
                        nevertheless another man could easily step in and effectively continue the
                        work. No doubt Mr. Hoover has told you, as he has me, that our food supply
                        at the present time is most satisfactory and that the present problem is to
                        dispose of properly the enormous supplies we have acquired through
                        stimulation of production. I understand that Mr. Julius Barnes is considered
                        the ablest of Mr. Hoover’s assistants and best equipped for his
                        position.</p>
                    <p>I should very much appreciate an expression of your views with reference to
                        these suggestions.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I received yesterday from
                        the British Embassy the enclosed paraphrase of a telegram from Lockhart at
                            Moscow.<note n="54" xml:id="d199fn1">Not printed.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The situation of the Czecho-Slovak forces in western Siberia seems to me to
                        create a new condition which should receive careful consideration. Prof.
                        Masaryk assured me that these rebels against Austria-Hungary, collected from
                        the Russian prison camps and from deserters, would not fight against the
                        Russians but only sought to pass via Vladivostok to the western front.</p>
                    <p>Now it appears that their efforts to reach Vladivostok being opposed by the
                        Bolsheviks they are fighting the Red Guards along the Siberian line with
                        more or less success. As these troops are most loyal to our cause and have
                        been most unjustly treated by the various Soviets ought we not to consider
                        whether something cannot be done to support them?</p>
                    <p>There are, it seems, between 10,000 and 15,000 at Vladivostok and some 40,000
                        to 60,000 in western Siberia. In the latter territory Omsk and Tomsk are
                        reported to be in their hands. Is it not possible that in this body of
                        capable and loyal troops may be found a nucleus for military occupation of
                        the Siberian railway?</p>
                    <p>I would like to confer with you on the subject after cabinet-meeting Tuesday
                        if you find it convenient.</p>

                            sufficient number to subjugate the land but desires—as clearly indicated
                            by a consistent course of conduct in Ukrainia, Finland and the Baltic
                            Provinces—to establish so-called governments of law and order which are
                            too weak to support themselves in the great class struggle but which may
                            be maintained and controlled by German force.</p>
                        <p>Second, that through such governments Germany hopes to control and
                            utilize Russian resources and, if possible, Russian man-power against
                            the Western Allies in this war, and to conclude the war with Russia
                            completely under the economic dominion of Germany.</p>
                        <p>Third, that forcible Allied intervention opposed by the Soviets would be
                            essentially analogous to what Germany is doing in the Ukraine, in
                            Finland and in the Baltic Provinces.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, that such intervention unless welcomed by the great mass of the
                            Russian people would be destructive in principle of the entire basis of
                            President Wilson’s democratic war policy.</p>
                        <p>Fifth, that forcible Allied intervention, if uninvited by the Soviet
                            power, will certainly be opposed and will result in civil war.</p>
                        <p>Sixth, that forcible Allied intervention can not be justified upon
                            grounds of military necessity, and will not prevent but will hasten and
                            make easy the consummation of Germany’s war aims in European Russia.</p>
                        <p>Seventh, that American economic co-operation with Russia will open the
                            way for effective Allied intervention with force and the creation of an
                            actual fighting front opposed to Germany in Russia.</p>

                        <p>America’s democratic war aims are such as to make allied intervention by
                            force in Russia inconceivable unless desired by the great mass of the
                            Russian people. Thus far there has been no expression <pb n="367"
                                xml:id="pg_367" facs="0413"/>of any such desire, but there is now
                            presented in the invitation coming from the responsible head of the
                            Soviet Government for America’s coöperation in economic reconstruction,
                            the opportunity for taking a vitally important preliminary step toward
                            complete economic and military coöperation in the creation of an
                            effective Eastern front. This suggestion should be considered solely as
                            a war measure, uninfluenced by altruistic concern for the Russian
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The Russian people and their leaders are learning by bitter daily
                            experience the necessity of organizing resistance to German power. When
                            the peace written by Germany at Brest-Litovsk was signed the condition
                            of the old army was such that it was utterly incapable of resisting any
                            organized force. Demobilization was the first indispensable prerequisite
                            for the creation of an effective force with which German power could be
                            opposed. The next step is the reconstruction of the economic situation.
                            Modern armies cannot survive unsupported by economic and industrial
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>It was upon the plea of the necessity for economic reconstruction that
                            the peace, frankly described as shameful, was accepted. The leaders of
                            the Soviet Government realize that their social-economic revolution must
                            fail, and that Russia will inevitably fall under the complete domination
                            of autocratic Germany unless immediate and effective assistance in the
                            reconstruction of economic life can be obtained. Their faith in the
                            formulas of International Socialism naturally repels the suggestion of
                            friendly cooperation with so-called Imperialistic and Capitalistic
                            Governments, but the compelling realities and necessities of life have
                            led in this case, as in many others, to readjustment and compromise.
                            Hence the present suggestion coming from the responsible head of the
                            Soviet Government which is an earnest request for America’s cooperation
                            in the internal reconstruction of economic life.</p>
                        <p>It is my sincere conviction, if this suggestion is acted upon and such
                            economic reorganization is accomplished as is needed to equip and
                            support a revolutionary army, that such an army can and will be formed
                            and that in such event the assistance of armed forces of the Allies will
                            be gladly accepted by the Soviet Power. This Power can not be expected
                            to countenance Allied intervention until convinced that the intervening
                            force will not be used to destroy it.</p>

                        <p>The aims of an Economic Commission sent to Russia to coöperate in the
                            problem of economic reconstruction will be— <list>
                                <item>First. To so reconstruct commercial distribution as to assure
                                    the consumption of Russian resources in Russia where they are
                                    vitally <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0414"/>needed, thus
                                    preventing such resources from being used for the support of the
                                    German people and the German armies.</item>
                                <item>Second. To control the use and disposition of surplus
                                    resources and through such control to prevent such use in the
                                    service of Germany.</item>
                                <item>Third. If possible to re-establish trade with Russia upon a
                                    basis which, while facilitating economic reconstruction in
                                    Russia, will at the same time furnish to the Allies for use in
                                    England and France necessary products shipped from Russia via
                                    Archangel, which otherwise would necessarily be brought to
                                    England from more distant ports requiring longer voyages and
                                    consequently a greater use of tonnage.</item>
                                <item>Fourth. To convince the Russian people that the interests of
                                    Russia and the Allies in overthrowing German autocracy are
                                    identical, and that American assistance is given solely with a
                                    view to hastening the day when Russia will be able to aid the
                                    destruction of the German menace.</item>
                                <item>Fifth. To encourage and assist in the organization of a
                                    voluntary revolutionary army, creating behind such an army the
                                    necessary organization for its economic support.</item>
                                <item>Sixth. To convince the leaders of Revolutionary Russia,
                                    whoever they may be, that the Allied Governments have no
                                    imperialistic purposes in Russia and will gladly send forces to
                                    assist the Russian people in opposing the aggression of German
                                    force; and through coöperation with these leaders, to obtain
                                    their consent to sending Allied troops which in coöperation with
                                    Russian forces may be sufficient to reestablish the Russian
                                    front.</item>
                                <item>Seventh. To obtain an accurate understanding of the
                                    fundamental social forces at work in Russia and to keep the
                                    American and other allied governments advised of the actual
                                    facts controlling the development of the Russian, social,
                                    economic and political revolution.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>Russia is not suffering so much from a lack of resources as from the
                            break-down of the ordinary processes of distribution. The Russian
                            peasant finds himself with a large quantity of grain and a large amount
                            of depreciated paper currency. If he takes his grain to the local center
                            of trade he finds none of the necessities of his life for sale, and can
                            not exchange his grain except for more depreciated paper money.
                            Consequently the grain is not brought to market. In several instances
                            where shipments of manufactured articles needed by the peasants have
                            been sent to villages, theretofore suffering from the lack of grain,
                            abundant supplies of grain have at once been brought from the
                            surrounding country by the peasants to be exchanged for the manufactured
                            articles.</p>
                        <p>While this is typical of the situation in many provinces, other
                            neighboring provinces are facing famine conditions because of crop
                            failures or other reasons, and have no grain with which to sow their
                            fields or to feed their people. In a district near Samara, the handling
                            of such a situation was attempted by the local peasant’s coöperative
                            society. Going to the peasants who lacked the seed wheat with which <pb
                                n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0415"/>to sow their fields, this
                            organization proposed to procure the necessary seed-wheat, provided the
                            peasants would advance the price of the grain which the society promised
                            to deliver within a fixed period of time. Many of the peasants, ignorant
                            of all methods of business involving even the simplest form of credit,
                            refused this offer made solely in their own interest. A unit of the
                            American Friends Society, which has been doing excellent work in that
                            district, determined to bridge the gap; and sending a man to Omsk found
                            no difficulty in purchasing the necessary seed-wheat, and after
                            procuring the same transported and sold it to the peasants without loss
                            in a majority of cases.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the factories in the industrial centers have in many cases
                            continued their operations and have produced manufactured articles that
                            are lacking in the country districts. In illustration: The J. M. Coates
                            Company, which produces 60 per cent of all the cotton thread produced in
                            Russia, and which has large factories in Petrograd, continued its
                            operations up to the end of February, 1918, and at that time had on hand
                            the largest stock of manufactured products its books had ever shown.
                            Owing to difficulties of communication, transport, and hauling, the
                            distributing branch of the business had not been functioning. That
                            efficient production is possible under Soviet rule has been demonstrated
                            by the experience of the International Harvester Company which has
                            largely increased its producing efficiency during the past six months
                            under Soviet rule. This experience was made possible through tactful
                            handling of a very difficult situation which resulted in effective
                            coöperation from the Soviet authorities who in order to get results were
                            willing when faced with the practical necessities of the situation, to
                            modify the rigid formulas of their economic theory. No doubt the
                            experience of this company is exceptional, but the tactful handling of
                            daily problems as they arise through a competent American Economic
                            Commission will be the most effective method of accomplishing similar
                            results in like cases.</p>
                        <p rend="center">

                        </p>
                        <p>Obviously nothing can be accomplished without the coöperation of
                            governmental power. The commission must, therefore, go if it goes at
                            all, willing to deal with the leaders of Revolutionary Russia actually
                            in power, without regard to their principles or formulas of economic,
                            social, or political life, so long as such leaders sincerely desire to
                            recreate forces in Russia which will be used in resisting the force of
                            German arms. Seeking such cooperation, the members of this commission
                            will be asked to advise regarding problems of a most practical and
                            controlling nature. They will be able to exert powerful influence to
                            prevent large commercial transactions with Germany. All of this <pb
                                n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0416"/>work will from necessity be
                            done under Government control and protection. Their advice re-enforced
                            by the uncompromising facts of life will lead inevitably to the
                            modification, adjustment, and softening of the hard and impossible
                            formulas of radical socialism; and because of the necessity of finding
                            it, a practical basis for progress will be found. The Russian Revolution
                            has now reached the stage where it is to be controlled, not by theory,
                            but by the unyielding necessities of life. This fact is becoming each
                            day more clear to the radical socialistic group now in control of the
                            Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent from the informality of the suggestion inviting American
                            coöperation that formal recognition of the Soviet Government is not a
                            necessary prerequisite to coöperation. Acting upon this informal
                            invitation, a commission can proceed to Russia and be placed in direct
                            touch with the entire situation without further formality.</p>
                        <p>American coöperation will give the Allies effective and controlling
                            influence upon the internal situation. Such coöperation will be able to
                            direct the forces supporting the Soviet Power against Germany. If
                            effective, coöperation will ultimately compel the continued utilization
                            against the Russian people of tyrannical German force, thus preventing
                            German coöperation and increasing the bitter resentment against Germany
                            which is steadily gaining ground in Russia. If the economic life of
                            Russia can be sufficiently organized to make possible the support of an
                            effective army, this growing resentment will surely crystallize in the
                            organization of an army which will effectively oppose the German menace
                            in Russia.</p>

                        <p>To accomplish substantial results the most competent organizing and
                            technical ability will be required. Members of the Commission must be
                            men of liberal views and sympathetic understanding, capable of meeting
                            fact conditions with practical ability to achieve results under
                            difficult and complex circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Under the control of the Commission it will be necessary to create an
                            extensive organization with representatives in all important centers of
                            Russian life. For this purpose the distributing and sales organizations
                            of large business concerns, both American and English, which have
                            heretofore been organized in Russia and which are now in danger of being
                            disorganized should be utilized and reorganized to meet the actual
                            demands of the situation. There are many such organizations in Russia
                            as, for instance, the New York Life Insurance Company, the J. M. Coates
                            Company, and the International Harvester Company.</p>
                        <p>The organization thus created by the Commission will co-operate in the
                            various local centers with various Russian agencies, including the local
                            Soviets, the Peasants’ Co-operative Societies and the local Zemstvos
                            where they are functioning. Thus the commercial and industrial needs
                            necessary for re-creation of commercial life may be effectively
                            ascertained. Through co-operation in railway management the opportunity
                            will be created of transporting manufactured goods from the place of
                            production to the place of consumption. The Commission will be able to
                            control the disposition of manufactured goods by the use of American
                            credit and upon transportation of such goods to the local centers will,
                            with them, be able to control the disposition of large food
                            products.</p>
                        <p>These products should of course be primarily used for consumption in
                            Russia and will be transported to the centers where food products are
                            lacking. Any surplus will be available for export.</p>
                        <p>If export trade with the Allies can be re-established upon such a basis
                            as to result in economic use of tonnage in bringing from Archangel
                            products required in England and France it should be possible in
                            exchange for these products to ship to Russia agricultural and other
                            tools and machinery and manufactured products. This trade should be in
                            the absolute control of the Commission, so that the distribution of the
                            goods sent to Russia will be, in so far as possible, under the control
                            of the Commission. With American credit and American goods the
                            Commission will be able to control the disposition of Russian resources,
                            vitally needed by Germany. In this connection it is encouraging to note
                            that there are authentic reports to the effect that Germany has been
                            endeavoring to make large purchases of American bank notes for the
                            purchase of grain from the Ukraine peasants. This fact indicates that
                            Germany has not at her <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0418"/>disposal
                            the goods required by the Ukrainian peasants for which they would be
                            willing to exchange their grain. Effective organization combined with
                            the use of American credit and the control of American goods should
                            effectively prevent the commercial exploitation of Russia by Germany
                            during the balance of the war.</p>
                        <p>The work of this Commission will be so extensive that the burden of
                            responsible supervision should not be placed upon any of the departments
                            of the Government already so greatly overburdened with work. In order to
                            meet this situation and at the same time to obtain proper co-ordination
                            it is suggested that a separate and independent department of the
                            Government be created under the Overman Act; that at the head of this
                            department there should be a man enjoying the absolute confidence of the
                            President, who shall be responsible only to the President; that there be
                            associated with him representatives of the various Government
                            departments having vital interests connected with the prosecution of the
                            war which may be related to the work of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>The Commission should be responsible only to this independent department
                            and, through it, responsible to the President. This department should be
                            granted an appropriation by Congress adequate to effectively carry on
                            its work. The very large amount of money which will be required is
                            indicated by the character of the work to be done.</p>
                        <p>Independent facilities of communication in cipher should be established
                            between the Commission and the department to which it is to be
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>Time is of the utmost importance. The Commission should be organized as
                            quickly as possible and should proceed to Russia via Archangel so as to
                            reach the center of European Russia without unnecessary delay.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In connection with the
                        Siberian Affair I would like to call your attention to two matters which I
                        think should be considered at once.</p>
                    <p>First: As Chinese troops are holding the Manchurian Railway east, and I
                        believe west, of Harbin, ought they or ought they not to be considered in
                        connection with the guarding of the Siberian Railroad in aid of the
                        Czecho-Slovaks?</p>
                    <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0419"/>
                    <p>Second: Ought we or ought we not to advise the Allied Governments, including
                        the Chinese, of our program before we hear from Tokio? There is the
                        possibility that the Japanese may consult them before we mention the matter.
                        If they do, we may be embarrassed in our relations with those Governments
                        who will consider us not frank. I am very sure that a secretive attitude
                        will deeply offend Reading and Jusserand, and, to a lesser degree, Cellere
                        and Koo. My own disposition is to be candid with them, now that the Japanese
                        Government has had time to consider our proposed program.</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                        called this afternoon. He said that he had not heard from his Government,
                        but that it might possibly expedite a decision if some arrangement could be
                        made as to the chief commander of the combined forces.</p>
                    <p>I told him that I had not discussed the subject with you because it did not
                        seem of prime importance but that in view of his raising the question I
                        would lay it before you. While making light of the matter to Ishii I think
                        that it is really a serious subject which will have to be settled very soon.
                        It presents considerable embarrassment, and, to tell the truth, I am at a
                        loss what to say as I am sure the Japanese will expect to be in high
                        command. Will you please be good enough to give me your judgment as to how I
                        should treat the subject with the Ambassador?</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: On Friday, the 16th, I
                        asked the Japanese Ambassador to come and see me in regard to a report that
                        Japanese troops were being sent to Manchu-li on the Manchurian border not
                        far from Chita, the western junction of the Eastern Manchurian and Amur
                        River railways. He evidently anticipated the purpose of the visit for he
                        brought with him a telegram from his Government. The substance of the
                        telegram he sent to me last night, and I enclose it to you. He also said
                        that the Japanese Government were sending between 3,000 and 5,000 troops to
                        Manchu-li and that these troops were part of forces stationed in Manchurian
                        garrisons further south.</p>
                    <p>I am also enclosing a letter from the French Ambassador on the Siberian
                        situation which is in substance a repetition of statements made to me on
                        Saturday morning.</p>
                    <p>To complete the documents in the case I am appending a telegram from Admiral
                        Knight to the Secretary of the Navy, under date of the 15th, and also a
                        report by General Dietrichs in command of the Czechs at Vladivostok,
                        forwarded by Consul Caldwell on the 15th.<note n="59" xml:id="d205fn1">For
                            the latter, see <ref target="frus1918Russiav02#pg_346">

                    </p>
                    <p>A careful consideration of the facts as disclosed by these communications
                        convinces me that the situation is developing in a way which differs
                        considerably from the plan originally determined upon and compels a
                        consideration of the policy which should be adopted in reference to the new
                        conditions presented.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the evidence points to an intention on the part of the
                        Japanese to send a larger number of troops to Vladivostok than the 13,500
                        already sent, while I feel sure that they will increase the force operating
                        at Manchu-li in the event that the pro-German troops should be superior. Of
                        course they assert that the Manchurian force will not go beyond Chinese
                        territory, but in view of the importance of the Chita junction I am not sure
                        that that is not their objective.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that on July 7 Irkutsk was captured by the Czecho-Slovaks,
                        that between that city or between Lake Baikal and the Chinese border there
                        are about 25,000 of the opposing forces largely composed of armed German and
                        Austrian prisoners, and that that section of the railroad is entirely in
                        their hands.</p>
                    <p>We are also informed that Czech troops, estimated variously at from 2,000 to
                        6,000, have reached Harbin from Vladivostok, which is <pb n="375"
                            xml:id="pg_375" facs="0421"/>apparently an utterly inadequate force to
                        push westward to Irkutsk in the face of the largely superior numbers near
                        Manchu-li.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this the Germans and Austrians and the Red Guard are in strong
                        force (estimated 80,000) north of Vladivostok along the Amur, so that it
                        will require all the Czechs remaining in the city together with the allied
                        forces landed to resist an attack on that port.</p>
                    <p>The question seems to be, therefore, what course should be taken to open a
                        way to relieve the Czecho-Slovaks in Western Siberia. Under present
                        conditions a military advance westward seems practically impossible. I do
                        not see how we can permit a deadlock to continue, because to do so would
                        destroy the whole value of the enterprise and seriously imperil the lives of
                        all the Czechs west of Irkutsk, who will if captured be treated as
                        traitors.</p>
                    <p>Frankly I think that the situation is getting beyond our control and that
                        unless we revise or modify our policy to meet these new conditions we will
                        be placed in a very embarrassing situation, especially so if any disaster
                        should occur to the Czechs in the west.</p>
                    <p>I think, too, that whatever is to be done to relieve the Czechoslovaks must
                        be done speedily since winter will set in within eight or ten weeks and the
                        rigorous climate will cause great suffering unless we can reach them with
                        supplies, of which, we are informed, they are so sorely in need.</p>
                    <p>I am not prepared to offer advice in the matter but I do feel that we must
                        assume that Japan, with the pressure of the present situation together with
                        the undoubted approval of the Allied Governments, will assert that military
                        conditions require her to send a much larger force both to Vladivostok and
                        to the western border of Manchuria.</p>
                    <p>If the Japanese Government indicate their purpose to take such action, what
                        ought we to say?</p>
                    <p>If we reach the conclusion that Japan will follow this course in any event,
                        would we or would we not be in a better position to control the situation in
                        the future by asserting that present conditions require Japan to send
                        sufficient troops to open the railroad to Irkutsk and to keep it open so
                        that we can send supplies to the Czechs?</p>
                    <p>I raise these questions for consideration only and not as an expression of
                        opinion. My only suggestion is that the situation calls for prompt
                        consideration.</p>

                        <p>The forces of the Soviet, virtually under command of the armed German and
                            Austro-Hungarian prisoners, have recently pressed back the Semenoff’s
                            troops to the borders of China. Part of the town of Manchuli has been
                            bombarded by them and the Japanese residents numbering some two hundred
                            fifty have been compelled to take flight to the town of Hailar. The
                            Chinese troops stationed at Manchuli were powerless to cope with the
                            Soviet forces and only succeeded by means of a compromise to check their
                            invasion into the town.</p>
                        <p>It is further reported that part of the Soviet forces seem to have
                            penetrated into the Chinese territory, proceeding eastward around the
                            north of Manchuli.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Referring to our
                            conversation of this morning I beg to confirm that my Government has
                            received somewhat serious news as to the situation of the eastern
                            section of the Tcheck army in Siberia.</p>
                        <p>Part of this section (2,000 men we are told) moving west in order to join
                            the western branch of the army has reached Kharbine. Their objective is
                            now Tchita which is apparently the key to the situation, is an important
                            railroad junction and is a strong position where the germano-bolshevik
                            resistance is powerfully organised.</p>
                        <p>General Dietrichs, General Paris (who is French) and the Japanese staff
                            have exchanged views and come to the conclusion that the contemplated
                            advance is not possible unless the Tchecks are immediately reinforced by
                            Japanese divisions.</p>
                        <p>My Government cables, that great as is their desire to abide without
                            change by the views of President Wilson and not to trouble <pb n="377"
                                xml:id="pg_377" facs="0423"/>him with new proposals, it seems
                            impossible to them not to place the facts before him, and ask whether he
                            does not think that something should be tried.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly necessary to leave troops in Vladivostok so as to defend
                            the rear of the Tcheck army, and destroy the threat resulting from the
                            enemy’s being strongly established north of Khabarovsk, where it holds
                            the line of the Amur. The Allied contingent will suffice for this
                            task.</p>
                        <p>At Kharbine the Tcheck troops are at a stand still, owing to the very
                            serious risk of being worsted by an enemy stronger than themselves and
                            established in a region easy to defend.</p>
                        <p>That something should be done is rendered more evident, in our eyes, by
                            the advanced season and the danger of the disorganisation and
                            destruction of the several Tcheck groups scattered along the
                            railroad.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem possible, under present circumstances to take Tchita and
                            to progress towards the Baikal and Irkoutsk, that is to realize the very
                            objective of the action agreed upon, without immediate and powerful
                            reinforcements. These should amount, as we take it, to 3 or 4 Japanese
                            divisions. Would the President agree to such an increase?</p>
                        <p>I commend this problem, my dear Mr. Secretary, to your immediate
                            attention and I should be much obliged if you were so good as to let me
                            know as soon as possible what are the views thereon of the
                            President.</p>

                            forces to be extended to Manchuria front and Baikhar region instead of
                            being confined to Ussuri front. This is in reference to Communication
                            from General Dieterichs and Czechs-Slovak forwarded by Consul to the
                            State Department this date. Unable to learn where impression originated
                            that assistance proposed is to be limited to any one area but in some
                            way this impression has become widespread and appears to be generally
                            accepted. It is even believed that American Forces are to remain at
                            Vladivostok. It is possible that Japanese Officials know something not
                            known to myself, and have communicated it confidentially to others.</p>

                    <p>Personally I feel that in view of our policy it would be unwise to do this
                        and that this is another move to impress our action in Siberia with the
                        character of intervention rather than relief of the Czechs. The suggestion
                        that our High Commissioner be the head of an international commission seems
                        to be a bait to draw us into this policy which has been so insistently urged
                        by Great Britain for the past six months.</p>
                    <p>It would relieve the situation if you authorized me to say to the Ambassadors
                        that we did not intend to appoint a High Commissioner and to state to the
                        press that at present we had no intention of making such an appointment.</p>
                    <p>If we decline to cooperate in this I believe that the Commission will have
                        little weight.</p>

                        is no other course. The Red Cross is sending underwear, socks, sweaters,
                        shirts, cloth for suiting and gloves, together with some shoes and sole
                        leather furnished by the Russian Embassy. Further than that there seems to
                        be no effort to send supplies of any kind and no effort being made to send
                        supplies of a military character. Unless supplies leave the United States
                        within the next three weeks it will be impossible to reach the Czechs,
                        because the winter sets in very early and most rigorously in that
                        climate.</p>

                        him with sufficient authority to get the information which seems to be
                        necessary before any shipment can be commenced and to report to you? This
                        seems to me to be the only solution of a situation which is at present
                        chaotic, in which no one seems to have authority and in which there is no
                        directed energy.</p>
                    <p>From a casual investigation, I am satisfied that there are supplies of a
                        military character in this country which can not possibly be used by our
                        armed forces and which can be most suitably used by the Czechs. This applies
                        to rifles, ammunition, machine guns and various other necessary equipment of
                        a military character.</p>
                    <p>Of course the work which the Red Cross is doing I feel should not be confused
                        with or sub-ordinated to the direction of any person whom you may designate,
                        and I think that it should be continued in the same independent manner, but
                        I do feel that any other relief which it is contemplated should be sent to
                        the Czechs should be supervised and directed by one person with sufficient
                        authority to co-ordinate all the efforts which will be necessary to get any
                        relief to them.</p>

                        full conference with Mr. Baruch<note n="63" xml:id="d209fn1">Chairman of the
                            War Industries Board.</note> about this matter? He is at the centre of
                        such information. He and I were speaking of it the other day, and I found
                        that he was familiar with the available stocks in the hands of the War
                        Department. His information and advice ought to enable us to get to a final
                        action.</p>
                    <p>Am I not right in the impression that it was understood that the Japanese
                        were to supply and supply at once the necessary military supplies for the
                        Czechs?</p>
                    <p>By the way, it begins to look as if the plan of the Japanese were to do the
                        fighting on their own plan and let the Czecho-Slovaks tag along, instead of
                        acting themselves as a supporting force.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am to see Mr. Baruch
                        tomorrow in regard to the matter of supplying the needs of the
                        Czecho-Slovaks, but, while I shall proceed along the lines already
                        suggested, I wish to offer the following as a method which seems to remove
                        the difficulty of coordinating the different sources of supply and also to
                        secure speedy action, which is so essential in view of the near approach of
                        winter.</p>
                    <p>I think that in view of the fact that we have recognized the Czecho-Slovak
                        National Council as a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government it might be
                        possible to make them a loan sufficient to purchase the necessary supplies
                        in this country. The entire responsibility and work of purchasing and
                        arranging for the transportation of the supplies would by this method fall
                        upon Professor Masaryk and his colleagues.</p>
                    <p>This course would have the advantage of giving substantial evidence of our
                        opinion as to the probable success of the movement and our faith in the
                        repayment of moneys loaned. But even if it was never repaid we would be no
                        worse off than if we expend the amount on supplies and gave them to the
                        Czecho-Slovaks.</p>
                    <p>Would you be good enough to let me have your opinion on this suggestion, and,
                        if it meets with your approval, an authorization <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381"
                            facs="0427"/>to lay it before Professor Masaryk either before or after
                        discussing the plan with the Treasury as you think best?</p>

                        have lately received, copies of which are enclosed, no doubt have greatly
                        heartened you as they have me, particularly the one received through the
                        Navy Department.<note n="64" xml:id="d213fn1">No enclosures with file copy
                            of this letter.</note> Our confidence in the Czech forces has been
                        justified and the fact that now a Russian military force of equal strength
                        has joined them combined with the gratifying reception given the Czechs by
                        the civilian population of the localities occupied is strong evidence to
                        prove that the Russians are entirely satisfied <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382"
                            facs="0428"/>to cooperate with the Czechs in Russia and that assistance
                        to the Czechs amounts to assistance to the Russians.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the news received has presented certain problems which, if
                        not met and overcome by us, may seriously impair our prestige not only with
                        those we would help—the Russians and the Czechs—but also with the Allies and
                        Japan. It is to you that liberal opinion throughout the world is looking for
                        a sound, constructive plan for assisting Russia. Reactionary influences in
                        Russia and else-where are at work to shake off your leadership and to take
                        advantage of any opportunity offered them to make use of Russia rather than
                        to serve her.</p>
                    <p>You have publicly declared that you intend to stand by Russia. You have
                        stated that our military forces sent to Russia are to render such protection
                        and help as is possible to the Czecho-Slovaks against the armed Austrian and
                        German prisoners who are attacking them and to steady any efforts at
                        self-government or self-defence in which the Russians themselves may be
                        willing to accept assistance, and that you hope and purpose eventually to
                        send economic and other relief to the Russian people, but that this would
                        follow and in no way embarass the military assistance rendered to the
                        Czecho-Slovaks. You have said you purpose not to desert the Czecho-Slovak
                        army engaged in conflict with nationals of the Central Powers in Siberia and
                        finally you have recognized the Czecho-Slovak Council, to which the army has
                        sworn allegiance, as a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government at war
                        with the Central Powers. You have moved cautiously and deliberately and each
                        declaration of policy has met with almost universal approval.</p>
                    <p>The problems presented by the late telegrams appear to me to fall under the

                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The Czecho-Slovaks—a military force operating in Siberia and the
                                Eastern part of European Russia.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The civilian population of Siberia.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>The civilian population along the Murman Coast and in the
                                Archangel District.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>(1) In order to render protection and help to the Czecho-Slovaks it is clear
                        we must get them military supplies, viz; clothing, shoes, arms and
                        ammunition. This can be done with the assistance of Mr. Baruch with whom I
                        have consulted and I understand that you are prepared to supply the
                        necessary money from your War Fund.</p>
                    <p>(2) The relief of the civilian population in Siberia does not involve the
                        sending of great quantities of food from this country. Clothing, shoes, and
                        certain specified commodities are required. Some months ago the United
                        States Shipping Board chartered through the Russian Embassy certain vessels
                        of the Russian Volunteer Fleet with the understanding that when these
                        vessels were needed by Russia <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0429"/>they
                        would be returned to her. It seems to me that in good faith we are now bound
                        to place these vessels at work carrying to the civilian population of Russia
                        such supplies as we can spare them. Any other use of them would be making
                        use of Russia and not serving her and would be most unjust.</p>
                    <p>(3) The rationing of the civilian population on the Murman Coast and in the
                        Archangel District seems to me to be essential as well from a military as
                        from a humanitarian standpoint. Certain foodstuffs have already been shipped
                        to these points from this country by the British Government. Ambassador
                        Francis’ cables of the second and third instant from Archangel show how
                        necessary it is that supplies be sent to that locality.<note n="65"
                            xml:id="d213fn2">Cable of Sept. 2, 1918, not printed; for the cable of
                            Sept. 3, 1918, see <ref target="frus1918Russiav02#pg_517">

                                    rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 517</ref>.</note> The coming on of
                        winter and the consequent closing of the ports makes it imperative that such
                        supplies as are shipped go forward before October first. The British
                        Government is prepared to supply the transportation and has proposed that
                        the ultimate expense of this rationing be borne jointly by the United
                        States, Great Britain, and France. This seems to me to be equitable and
                        accordingly I request authority to state that this Government will
                        contribute its share. The total expenditure has been estimated at
                        approximately $15,000,000. However, as Ambassador Francis states, the plan
                        is not to give away this food, except to prevent starvation, but to sell it
                        and consequently a certain amount of the initial expenditure will be
                        refunded. This expenditure being in the aid of and as a direct result of the
                        sending of American troops to those points it would seem to me it might
                        properly be met by the setting aside of $5,000,000 from your fund for the
                        National Security and Defense and I suggest that this be done.</p>
                    <p>A number of problems of considerable difficulty are presented by (2) and (3)
                            <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> and it seems to me it would be most helpful
                        if these problems, which involve financial questions, methods of barter and
                        exchange, et cetera, could be studied and solutions found by one of the
                        established War Boards of this Government working under the direction of a
                        man who thoroughly understands your policies and who is in close personal
                        and official contact with the heads of the various governmental agencies
                        concerned with these problems. It has occurred to me that Mr. Vance
                        McCormick is peculiarly fitted for such work. He has the liberal point of
                        view and his ability to work with the heads of the various boards and
                        departments here has been well tested. His own organization—the War Trade
                        Board—composed as it is of representatives of the Treasury Department, the
                        Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Food
                        Administration, and the Shipping Board, is almost ideally fitted to study
                            <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0430"/>these problems and to submit to
                        you a report concerning them. I suggest therefore that he be requested to
                        begin this work under your direction.</p>
                    <p>I would appreciate very much receiving instructions from you respecting the
                        foregoing points.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Sisson</hi>: In the absence of Mr. Creel I
                        am addressing myself to you in an urgent matter. I have just been offered an
                        opportunity this morning to read the first installment of the data which the
                        Committee proposes to release for publication tomorrow and which contains a
                        scathing arraignment of Lenine and Trotsky and the Bolsheviki leaders.<note
                            n="66" xml:id="d214fn1">For this material as published, see War
                            Information Series, No. 20, <hi rend="italic">The German-Bolshevik
                                Conspiracy</hi> (Washington [Government Printing Office],
                            1918).</note> It is not likely that the Germans will fail to bring this
                        attack, published by a Committee of which three of the President’s cabinet
                        are members, to the attention of the Bolsheviki.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Poole, American Consul at Moscow, with the Department’s approval, has
                        courageously remained at his post to give countenance to his colleagues of
                        the Allied Governments who are under arrest. Mr. Allan Wardwell and Mr.
                        Andrews of the Red Cross and two Y. M. C. A. secretaries have remained at
                        Moscow. At least two American women are reported to be still either at
                        Moscow or Petrograd.</p>
                    <p>The publication of the data against the Bolshevik leaders includes an
                        arraignment of their personal integrity. In my judgment it goes further,
                        therefore, than any of the political activities which have been charged by
                        the Bolsheviki against the British and French representatives now under
                        arrest. In other words, what the Committee proposes will not only tend to
                        arouse bitter animosity against Mr. Poole and the other Americans in
                        Russia—where hitherto they have occupied a somewhat special position owing
                        to the attitude of this Government—but will not unlikely imperil their lives
                        and jeopardize further the already precarious position of the official
                        representatives of the Allies.</p>
                    <p>If the data against the Bolshevik leaders is released on the date which I
                        understand is proposed, namely tomorrow, September 15th, <pb n="385"
                            xml:id="pg_385" facs="0431"/>it will be impossible to communicate with
                        Mr. Poole in time to secure the departure of himself and the remaining
                        Americans in Russia. In the circumstances, I am unwilling to share
                        responsibility for the consequences which may result from the publication of
                        these documents.</p>
                    <p>On April 23, 1918, I telegraphed the American Ambassador at London<note
                            n="67" xml:id="d214fn2">Telegram not printed.</note> that no publication
                        of this data was desired at that time or pending further conference. I
                        assume, therefore, that the Committee’s proposed action has been taken only
                        after the British authorities at London have been properly informed of the
                        Committee’s intention. Please inform me definitely on this point.</p>

                        the enclosed telegram (23d, 10 pm) from Mr. Morris with the same anxiety
                        that I have.<note n="69" xml:id="d218fn1">
                            <ref target="frus1918Russiav02#pg_387">
                                <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 387</ref>.</note> It presents very
                        clearly a situation full of difficulties because the Russian communities of
                        the Volga region, which have been friendly to the Czecho-Slovaks, being
                        unarmed, will be at the mercy of the Red Guards, who have committed such
                        monstrous crimes within the past six weeks in Moscow and other cities, if
                        the Czecho-Slovaks withdraw to the east of the Urals.</p>
                    <p>I must confess that I sympathize with the spirit of the Czecho-Slovaks when
                        they say that they cannot abandon their helpless friends to certain massacre
                        and pillage. I believe that the world would be disposed to condemn such a
                        course, and that the Czecho-Slovaks with their high sense of honor would
                        rather die on the Volga than bear the charge of such ingratitude.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that we must assume that the Czecho-Slovak force west of the
                        Urals will remain there and do the best that they can to protect the
                        friendly Russian communities from Bolshevik excesses.</p>
                    <p>The question is what ought we to do in the circumstances and what can we do
                        in case we feel it our duty to assist them? It is an extremely <pb n="387"
                            xml:id="pg_387" facs="0433"/>difficult question to answer because I
                        think that we must assume that, justly or unjustly, we will be blamed for
                        the consequences unless we can show conclusively that it was utterly
                        impossible to give aid to the Czecho-Slovaks in eastern Russia.</p>
                    <p>We could of course say, adhering rigidly to our announced policy, that it is
                        their duty, regardless of their Russian allies, to join their compatriots in
                        Siberia and that we ought not to be asked to come to their assistance if
                        they do not follow that course. But I fear that such a declaration of
                        attitude would be generally criticized and would place the blame upon us if
                        disaster should fall upon the communities of eastern Russia.</p>
                    <p>Yet, assuming that we ought to aid these people if we can, what can we do? I
                        do not see how, with the small force which we have in Siberia, we can do
                        more than hasten arms and ammunition to them and refrain from urging them to
                        withdraw at the present time. But, even with sufficient munitions and
                        supplies, I doubt if so small a body of troops can avoid final annihilation
                        unless a considerable force is sent to cooperate with them in repelling the
                        Bolsheviks. Where is such a force to come from? A few thousands would appear
                        useless. There seems to be only one source and that is Japan, and I feel
                        quite convinced that the Japanese Government, even if it were physically
                        possible, would hesitate to enter on so hazardous an adventure.</p>
                    <p>The more I consider the matter the more perplexing and distressing it
                        becomes. We cannot abandon the Czecho-Slovaks on the ground that they will
                        not abandon their Russian friends. Of course that would never do. And yet,
                        what is the alternative, or is there any?</p>
                    <p>In view of the recent examples of the blood-thirsty character of the
                        Bolsheviks, which has introduced a new factor into the problem of relieving
                        the Czecho-Slovaks, I feel that we should give most careful consideration to
                        the suggestions of Mr. Morris.</p>
                    <p>I would be grateful for your instructions or opinion as to the policy we
                        should adopt in dealing with this new situation which was not foreseen when

                        <p>After a careful perusal of the Memorandum, and after a comparison with

                                <ref target="frus1918Russiav02#pg_328">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 328</ref>.</note> I come to the
                            conclusion that the Memorandum gives only general direction, but that it
                            radically changes the Statement of August 3rd; in this respect the
                            question arises as to why is the Statement of August 3rd cancelled at a
                            time when the whole situation, political and military, is changing so
                            favorably.</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>The Memorandum very aptly emphasizes the difficulty of military
                            activities west of the Urals, and expresses the view that our forces
                            should retire to the eastern side of the Ural Mountains. Not long ago
                            (Agreement with General Janin, September 21st) I myself viewed the
                            possibility of retiring over the Urals, but only in case the Germans
                            should conclude a military agreement with the Bolsheviks, and send their
                            regular forces against us.</p>
                        <p>I need not say that I would not dare to decide such a strategical
                            question here far from the scene of action; the military situation <pb
                                n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0435"/>changes now almost every day,
                            and new possibilities may arise while this is written. If, for instance,
                            Bulgaria should leave the Austro-German Alliance, and, perhaps, even
                            join the Entente, if Turkey should follow Bulgaria, and if Rumania
                            should again declare war upon the Central Powers, (which she probably
                            would do in case of Bulgarian and Turkish defection), the situation on
                            the Volga would change radically. The Germans could hardly spare troops
                            to send against us in such a case; and should Rumania move either
                            against Hungary or in the Ukraina, our army, properly armed, could reach
                            even Moscow. Of course, all this rests on many if’s—but such is the
                            kaleidoscopic situation which does not allow me to make a definite
                            decision in this, primarily a military matter.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I should consider it necessary to hear the opinions of our
                            Commander-in-chief, General Janin, who is now on his way to Vladivostok,
                            and of the Allied Commanders, now acting in Siberia, before I could come
                            to the definite conclusion that the territory west of the Ural Mountains
                            should be abandoned. The Memorandum gives no date for this proposed
                            retirement; I therefore understand that a definite decision on this
                            point is left for the future.</p>
                        <p>I know too well the history of the ill-reputed Austrian Military
                            Court-Council, deciding strategical problems from Vienna, to be tempted
                            to follow such course and try to make decisions on strategical questions
                            here in Washington, thousands of miles away from the battlefield. The
                            question of retirement over the Urals is a strategical one; the
                            responsible commanders must decide when and in what manner—whether at
                            once or in <hi rend="italic">étapes</hi>—the retirement is to take
                            place; perhaps it may be advisable not to surrender the Urals to the
                            enemy at once, but to retire from Samara say to Ufa, and keep the
                            passage over the Urals. All these questions of strategical detail must
                            be left to responsible commanders.</p>
                        <p>The same applies to the question as to where to retire in Western
                            Siberia.</p>
                        <p>The Statement of August 3rd accepts the westward move of our troops, and
                            the strategical aid of the Allies has been planned in accordance with
                            it; the Memorandum changes this one all-important point, arguing that
                            military activities west of the Urals are impossible. In my opinion they
                            are not quite impossible, if our troops get in time the necessary arms
                            and ammunition and help in general; such activities will be made more
                            possible if the Allies send some larger military assistance. I
                            understood from the Statement of August 3rd that the United States would
                            not send larger contingents, but that does not exclude other troops in
                            such moderate numbers as would work no injury to the Western front.</p>

                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>The Memorandum says that the Germans should not be allowed to get
                            supplies from Western Siberia. That is a very sound contention; but it
                            is for the very same reason that we are trying to keep Samara; the
                            region of the Volga (Samara-Saratov) is the best in all Russia. That is
                            a well known fact. I have no statistics of this year’s crop in that
                            region, nevertheless I emphasize the great importance of Samara (being
                            also a junction of the Turkestan Railroad).</p>
                        <p rend="center">III</p>
                        <p>At any rate, the suggested retirement of our troops, as I understand it,
                            is not made a condition of the United States’ help. The Memorandum
                            states that the supplies cannot be sent west of the Urals. If I am
                            right, the supplies are now sent to Vladivostok (or via Fusan to
                            Harbin?) and then by the railroad to the west; if the materials can be
                            brought to e. g. Chelyabinsk it should be possible to bring them a
                            little farther to Ufa. Anyhow, the problem remains: to hold the Siberian
                            railroad, and by that Siberia in general.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV</p>
                        <p>The particular question of Murmansk and Archangelsk I can omit, as it
                            does not directly concern, our troops; I only would point to the fact
                            that the Memorandum in this respect changes the Statement of August 3rd;
                            but the question concerns the Allies.</p>
                        <p rend="center">V</p>
                        <p>From the Memorandum I infer that it has been drawn up without a
                            consultation with the Allies; that puts me in a rather singular
                            position. The Statement of August 3rd says that the action of the Allies
                            will not be restricted by the United States and that they may use their
                            own independent judgment in matters concerning Russia (Siberia): is that
                            statement still valid?</p>
                        <p rend="center">VI</p>
                        <p>I hinted at the question of tactics: how will the Germans and Austrians
                            take the voluntary retreat from Russia? And how will it be accepted by
                            the Bolsheviks?</p>
                        <p>The recent reverses of the Germans in the West and the promising
                            developments of things on the Eastern front needs must lower the
                            Germano- and Austro-philism of the Bolsheviks: I would use this change
                            and try to detach the Bolsheviks from the Germans and Austrians; I would
                            try to get paid for the retirement, to put it <pb n="391"
                                xml:id="pg_391" facs="0437"/>bluntly. That of course is not an easy
                            diplomatic job, but I would try anything to help our common cause. I
                            explained clearly enough my views of the Bolsheviks; I do not agree with
                            them and their tactics, but, if I may use one of President Wilson’s
                            utterances . . . I would speak even with the devil. It is my conviction
                            that the attitude of the Allies towards the Bolsheviks has been a wrong
                            one from the beginning; it was and is not right to withdraw from Russia
                            and leave her and the Bolsheviks entirely to the Germans and
                            Austrians.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VII</p>
                        <p>I regret that the Memorandum proclaims the succor to the Russian people
                            as impracticable; such a radical change from the stand of the Statement
                            of August 3rd will have a very bad effect on the Russian people, if it
                            becomes known, and will be used by the Central Powers against all of us.
                            I am myself critical enough in the question of Russia’[s] ability soon
                            to rally, but I am far from being as sceptical as the Memorandum appears
                            to be. But here again I am touching at a sore point—the lack of a
                            uniform and clear plan of the Allies and the United States concerning
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>The Statement of August 3rd provides for help to the Russian people on a
                            large and generous scale; it makes three promises to Russia: <hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) support for organization of self-defense, <hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) support for restoring her self-government,
                            and, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>) a very elaborate plan of economic and
                            administrative commission is put forward. The Memorandum cancels these
                            economic and humanitarian plans; from the short wording of the
                            Memorandum it can be inferred that the support for organizing
                            self-defense even in Siberia is now denied,—I do not make such a radical
                            deduction, but the enemies will be sure to make it. I approve of a
                            critical attitude towards some phantastic promises to organize a great
                            Russian Army in a short time; and yet I myself think that a considerable
                            Russian force could be organized in a few months,—at any rate, an
                            attempt must be made in that direction. As I understand it, such an
                            attempt made at least in Siberia will not contradict the Memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I presume that this Memorandum will not be published; but, as I asked, it
                            should be sent to General Janin. I am sending him these Notes, asking
                            him to devote his whole attention to the suggested plan of retirement
                            over the Urals. That, with the restriction of the Murmansk and
                            Archangelsk operations, and the abandonment of Russia (proper) to
                            herself, seem to me to be the salient points of the Memorandum.</p>

                        their importance to other nations and the necessity of correcting these
                        conditions so far as possible, together with certain suggestions as to means
                        which would seem practicable for the accomplishment of this change. I
                        believe the time has come when it is important to lay the whole matter
                        before Congress and to obtain, if possible, the necessary legislation to aid
                        in the economic rehabilitation of the Russian nation. I would suggest
                        therefore, if it meets with your approval, that this report to you be
                        transmitted to Congress with a recommendation that it should receive its
                        consideration and such action as is necessary.</p>
                    <p>You will perceive that the power to continue aid for Russia is about to end
                        and that unless Congress acts we will be helpless to continue our present
                        policy. If you approve of the report and are desirous of continuing to help
                        the Russian people, of which of course I have no question, I would recommend
                        the speedy transmission of the report by a brief message to Congress without
                        going into detail.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I desire to call your attention to the enclosed resolution
                        which has been submitted in the House of Representatives by Mr. Rhodes<note

                        withdrawal of all our forces from Siberia. I heartily recommend it for your
                        approval. The Secretary of War has read it and is in thorough accord. He

                        Vladivostok and is large enough to carry all our troops.</p>
                    <p>The truth of the matter is the simple fact that the Kolchak Government has
                        utterly collapsed; the armies of the Bolsheviki have <pb n="393"

                        are reported to be acting with moderation. The people seem to prefer them to
                        the officers of the Kolchak régime. Further, the Bolshevik army is
                        approaching the region where our soldiers are, and contact with them will
                        lead to open hostilities and to many complications. In other words, if we do
                        not withdraw we shall have to wage war against the Bolsheviki.</p>

                    <p>The following statements are made up from my private notes and from my
                        personal correspondence.</p>
                    <p>In January, 1918, the disorders which threatened Vladivostok were so serious
                        that the British and Japanese Governments, at the request of the Consuls at
                        that port, dispatched war vessels to protect foreign residents and their
                        property. At a conference of the American Ambassador at Tokio with the
                        Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs about January 15th the latter stated
                        that, in case it became necessary on account of the political unrest to
                        occupy Vladivostok and the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Amur branch,
                        Japan asked to do this alone, and that a definite request to this effect had
                        been made upon Great Britain. This same attitude of opposition to any joint
                        military action was emphasized by a message to the President from the
                        Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs delivered orally to the Counselor for
                        the Department by an American citizen on January 24th, in which the Minister
                        expressed the hope that the Government of the United States would not send
                        troops to Vladivostok or Harbin for the purpose of keeping order as such a
                        course would “create a very unfavorable impression in Japan.”<note n="76"

                            of State to President Wilson, <ref target="#pg_351">p. 351</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The President was much disturbed by this attitude of the Japanese Government
                        and the Division of Far Eastern Affairs openly opposed it suggesting that an
                        international commission ought to handle the matter, thus avoiding
                        jealousies and suspicions.</p>
                    <p>Sometime prior to February 24th the Allied Governments decided to withhold
                        consent to Japanese intervention in Siberia, a decision which the Japanese
                        Minister of Foreign Affairs told the American <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394"
                            facs="0440"/>Ambassador that he deplored since it was becoming
                        increasingly necessary and Japan had made all the preparations to act
                            immediately.<note n="77" xml:id="d223fn2">See <ref

                    <p>Subsequent interviews on February 27th with the British and French

                        military intervention in Siberia had reached the stage of deciding whether
                        Japan should be requested by the Allies to intervene or should be allowed to
                        proceed independently. That Japan would send troops to Vladivostok and
                        Harbin seemed to be an accepted fact.</p>
                    <p>In the circumstances the President decided that it was useless to oppose
                        intervention by Japan and notified the Allied Governments that the United
                        States had no objection to a request being made by them upon Japan to act in
                        Siberia, but that the United States could not for certain reasons join with
                        them in such request. This was on March 1, 1918.<note n="79"

                        of the Government of the United States that Japan should declare that, if
                        she intervened in Siberia, she would do so only as an ally of Russia.<note

                    <p>This message was shown to the British French and Italian Ambassadors before
                        it was sent. The Italian Ambassador stated that his Government held that a
                        condition to their consent to intervention had been and still was that
                        “action should <hi rend="underline">not</hi> be by Japan alone.”</p>
                    <p>On March 24th I wrote to the President<note n="81" xml:id="d223fn6">See <hi

                        reviewing the chaotic state of affairs in Siberia and said “that in view of
                        these facts I do not see how Japan could be expected to refrain from taking
                        military measures.” I stated that the question now presented was “whether
                        Japan alone or the Powers arrayed against Germany acting jointly should
                        constitute the expeditionary force.” Two days later the President advised me
                        orally that he was not prepared to change the policy adopted, which was
                        against military intervention. This I think was due to the opposition of his
                        military advisers who throughout were hostile to intervention.</p>
                    <p>Both the British and French Governments were at the time strongly advocating
                        intervention in Siberia, as well as in other parts of Russia, and early in
                        April the French Ambassador advised me<note n="82" xml:id="d223fn7">See <ref

                        American, French and Italian Ambassadors at Vologda had reached the
                        following conclusions:</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><p>“1st. That Japanese intervention was more than ever
                            necessary to Combat Germany.</p>

                        <p>“2nd. That it will only work its full effect if it bears the character of

                    <p>The French Government urged the cooperation of the United States in the
                        expedition “even though it were merely nominal”.</p>
                    <p>On April 25th Lord Reading advocated coöperation in Siberian
                            intervention,<note n="83" xml:id="d223fn8">See <ref

                        if Japan acted alone, it would result in a large proportion of the Russian
                        population going over to Germany. He pointed out how the Allies could
                        operate at Murmansk and in Southern Russia but stated that the important
                        step would be an advance through Siberia by a force predominantly Japanese
                        and American. He then asked if the President would be disposed to agree to
                        the sending of an American force to the Far East.</p>
                    <p>As the British plan contemplated the uniting of various Russian factions
                        against Germany in order to make effective the economic blockade of that
                        country, its feasibility did not appeal to the President.</p>

                        said to me in reply to a question as to the participation of the United
                        States or of the Allies in a military expedition in the event that
                        intervention in Siberia became necessary, that he personally would welcome
                        it, and that he believed his Government would hold the same opinion, and
                        that it was evident that the presence at least of troops of the United
                        States, Japan and China would go far to remove the suspicion of the Russians
                        as to the purpose of territorial conquest which might be inferred if Japan
                        acted alone. He was asked to obtain authority from his Government to say
                        this. He said that he would.</p>
                    <p>On May 16th the American Ambassador at Tokio informed the Department<note

                        General Staff in view of information received from the Japanese Ambassador
                        at Washington were advocating a plan of Allied intervention under Japanese
                        command.</p>
                    <p>While Japan had evidently ceased to object to joint action in Siberia, the
                        President had not approved uniting with Allied Governments in requesting

                        of discussion with Lord Reading on May 20th.</p>
                    <p>In the early part of June reports arrived that the Czecho-Slovak forces in
                        western Siberia were endeavoring to make their way to Vladivostok. Later,
                        about June 20th, came the report that the Bolsheviks were opposing this
                        movement and that the refugees had been compelled to fight the Red Guards
                        along the Siberian Railway. On <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0442"/>the

                        that this seemed to me to create a new condition in the problem of
                        intervention in Siberia, and that means of giving the Czechs support should
                        be considered.</p>

                    <p>The day following this interview the British, French and Italian Ambassadors
                        called upon me,<note n="87" xml:id="d223fn12">See <ref

                        as spokesman, said that they wished to know whether the Allied Governments
                        were not to take part in the initial landing of troops at Vladivostok or
                        whether it was the purpose to confine the enterprise to Japanese and
                        American troops.</p>
                    <p>I replied that the matter had not been discussed because it seemed useless to
                        go into details until the Japanese had approved the general plan, but that
                        we had always intended to lay the matter before the Allied Governments and
                        to advise with them provided the Japanese accepted our program.</p>
                    <p>On July 24th the Counselor of the Department, the acting Secretary of State
                        during my absence from Washington, sent me a copy of the following letter
                        which he had addressed to the President, in which he detailed a conference
                        that he had had that afternoon with the Japanese Ambassador:</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have had several
                            conversations recently with the Japanese Ambassador. He is very anxious
                            that we shall make another effort to bring the Japanese question to an
                            end.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that it was agreed we should attempt to secure the
                            ratification of a treaty which would guarantee to the Japanese now in
                            the country equal treatment with other aliens and thus prevent any other
                            state from passing such laws as California has passed.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d224fn1">For correspondence previously printed on this
                                subject, see <ref target="frus1913#pg_625">

                        </p>
                        <p>In the original treaty proposed by them there was a clause which would
                            have invalidated the California law insofar as it affected the right of
                            inheritance. I explained to him that any attempt to interfere with the
                            California law would, in all probability, prevent the ratification of
                            the treaty and it was finally omitted. It was the fact that it was
                            omitted that led the new Government over there to withdraw the
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Chinda now renews the proposition in another form. The

                        <p>I told him that I thought objection might be raised to this treaty on the
                            ground it did not settle the question, but while he did not say so I
                            think that his idea is that we can get a treaty ratified which will
                            prevent any future legislation against the Japanese and it will be
                            easier to settle this question.</p>
                        <p>In other words—that, having removed the fear of other legislation, the
                            acuteness of this question will be over.</p>
                        <p>He also says that he believes simultaneously with this treaty a treaty
                            could be signed such as we have signed with the thirty other countries,
                            providing for investigation in all cases, and he is quite <pb n="400"
                                xml:id="pg_400" facs="0446"/>anxious that such a treaty shall be
                            negotiated between his country and ours. I think such a treaty would go
                            a long way toward answering the “jingos” who are always insisting upon
                            our getting ready for war with Japan.</p>
                        <p>I have explained to the Ambassador that it would be impossible to have
                            this treaty ratified at this session and that, that being the case, it
                            would not be wise to negotiate it before the conclusion of Congress.
                            There is no immediate action necessary, therefore, and you can consider
                            it at your leisure and let me know what you think of the proposal.
                            Believing, as I do, that the states should not be permitted to raise
                            international issues (which they cannot settle by themselves) I am
                            favorable to the principle set forth in the proposed Convention, and I
                            do not believe we will find any permanent settlement of the Japanese
                            question short of some such action.</p>

                            adjourned and you are relieved somewhat from the pressure to which you
                            have been subjected there is one matter which I would like to have you
                            revolve in your mind.</p>
                        <p>I see but one way of relieving the Japanese situation on the Coast and
                            that is by the dispersion of the Japanese in this country so as to
                            relieve the economic pressure which has aroused protest. In discussing
                                <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0447"/>the subject with the
                            Japanese I have tried to convince them that the question is not a race
                            question, but purely an economic question and I have given them what
                            seems to be conclusive proof, namely, that although we have Japanese in
                            every state they have no trouble whatever with their neighbors except
                            where they congregate in large colonies and thus create an economic
                            situation. If it were a race question they would have trouble wherever
                            they appear, but, being an economic question the trouble appears only
                            when they are found in sufficient numbers to create economic
                            embarrassment for Americans about them.</p>
                        <p>If I am right in this theory then the remedy for the difficulty would
                            seem to be the dispersion of those in this country—emigration having now
                            been stopped—among enough states to prevent economic complaint.</p>
                        <p>I venture to submit, therefore, for your consideration the following
                            plan:</p>
                        <p>A diplomatic agreement between the United States and Japan that the two
                            Governments shall cooperate for the scattering of the Japanese now in
                            this country with a view to reducing the number in California by
                            one-half, the reduction to be made where the concentration is greatest
                            and where complaint has been aroused.</p>
                        <p>Japanese now residing in California are to be encouraged to move into
                            other states, with the understanding that not more than one thousand
                            shall go into any other state, not more than one hundred into any one
                            county in such state, and that those going into a county shall be so
                            distributed that not more than five per cent of the population of any
                            organized city, village or voting precinct shall be Japanese.</p>
                        <p>I have talked over this plan with Ambassador Chinda but I have explained
                            to him that it did not have your endorsement and was not presented as a
                            proposition and should not be presented to his Government. It has simply
                            been discussed by us unofficially in an effort to reach some solution of
                            the difficulty.</p>
                        <p>If we can reduce the Japanese population in California by one-half and
                            give assurance to other states now complaining that there will be no
                            increase in their population and that this plan of scattering will be
                            used as far as the two Governments can bring influence to bear, we may
                            be able to secure a repeal of the anti-Japanese laws in California.
                            These laws were not intended so much against present evils as against
                            evils which the people of California feared.</p>
                        <p>For the same reason I believe that such a plan would prevent hostile
                            legislation in other states because when Japanese have come into other
                            states agitation has been commenced on the fear that they might come in
                            numbers large enough as to raise economic objections.</p>

                        <p>Will you let me know whether you think there is any merit in the above
                            plan and if so whether any modifications suggest themselves to you? If
                            the plan seems to you improbable have you anything in mind that would
                            give us a working basis for a settlement? The Japanese Government has
                            exercised so much control over its citizens here that I believe it would
                            be possible to carry out some such plan as this, and, if carried out, I
                            believe it would go far toward restoring harmonious relations. As the
                            “gentlemen’s agreement” has prevented any new immigration, the number of
                            those in the country would, by natural law, gradually decrease and this
                            decrease would be accelerated by those who return to Japan, so that in
                            the course of a few years we might expect the friction to cease
                            entirely.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I should like to take
                            time to think this over maturely. I have now no comment to make except
                            this preliminary one: that there seems to me to be a danger that the
                            attempt to disperse the Japanese in this country might lead to the very
                            thing we wish to prevent. It might produce uneasiness in the States to
                            which the Japanese were induced to migrate and to popular clamors there
                            which legislatures might not withstand. Would we not before-hand have to
                            canvass the matter with State authorities and work out a programme which
                            we could be sure from the outset we could carry out. Otherwise the
                            offense might grow greater, not less, in case of failure.</p>

                            <p>The Japanese-American question which calls for an immediate
                                adjustment, is that of the treatment of the resident Japanese in
                                this country. What Japan desires is nothing more than the enjoyment
                                of the most favored nation treatment. That desideratum may be
                                attained, in my personal opinion, by the adoption of some of the
                                following means.</p>
                            <p>1. By Treaty.</p>
                            <p>a. By concluding an independent treaty, mutually guaranteeing to the
                                citizens and subjects, the most favored nation treatment, in matters
                                of property and other rights relative to the exercise of industries,
                                occupations, and other pursuits. Negotiations in this line, were for
                                some time conducted between Secretary Bryan and Ambassador Chinda,
                                which, however, for reasons I need not here state, have since been
                                in abeyance.</p>
                            <p>b. By revising the existing commercial treaty between our two
                                countries, so as to conform, in its stipulations, to similar
                                engagements between Japan and various European powers, which
                                guarantee in principle, the most favored nation treatment, in the
                                enjoyment of property rights and in all that relates to the pursuit
                                of industries, callings and educational studies.</p>
                            <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0450"/>
                            <p>2. By American legislation.</p>
                            <p>Although the subject is not fit for international discussion, it may
                                be mentioned that a constitutional amendment restraining any state
                                from making and enforcing any law discriminatory against aliens in
                                respect to the property and other civil rights, will prove a
                                far-reaching remedy. In fact a resolution with the same object in
                                view has, I understand, been introduced in Congress lately.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, I may state the fact that the provisions of
                                racial distinction in the present naturalization law, were, in a
                                number of instances, made use of for the purpose of depriving
                                Japanese subjects of the rights and privileges of a civil nature.
                                Although the wisdom of the law is in itself a matter of national and
                                not international concern, the unfortunate circumstance that certain
                                provisions of that law furnish a pretext for the impairment of alien
                                rights, should, I may be allowed to remark, constitute a fit subject
                                for legislative attention.</p>
                            <p>The comparative merits of each means should be studied by both
                                Governments in the light of expediency and feasibility. Whether the
                                adoption of any one means will be sufficient to cover the whole
                                ground is a matter upon which precaution forbids me to pass a final
                                judgment at present, but I am strongly convinced that each means
                                will go a long distance towards a complete solution of the
                                question.</p>
                            <p>Before concluding, I desire to touch upon the subject of immigration.
                                The question whether Japanese laborers shall be admitted or not, has
                                been consummately solved by the continued faithful observance by
                                Japan of the so-called Gentleman’s Agreement. So far as the Japanese
                                Government is concerned, it is no longer in the realm of living
                                questions, and in my view, it would serve the best interests of both
                                nations to leave the question as it is.</p>

                            desired effect. It brought out the fact that the additional concessions
                            were presented as <hi rend="underline">requests</hi>—not as demands.
                            They were presented at the same times that the demands were made but the
                            Ambassador, who called today, in leaving the memorandum which I
                                enclose,<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">
                                <ref target="frus1915#pg_97">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 97</ref>.</note> explained that
                            there is a material difference between the presentation of the requests
                            contained in this article and the <hi rend="underline">demands</hi> set
                            forth in the memorandum left with us. He emphasizes the fact that he,
                            himself, did not know of these additional requests; but when the papers
                            kept reiterating them he made inquiry of his Government.</p>
                        <p>You have a flimsy of the telegram just received from Guthrie<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d229fn3">
                                <ref target="frus1915#pg_96">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 96</ref>.</note> and from it I
                            think you will draw the same inference that I did, namely, that they
                            will not press these requests. I think our telegram will contribute
                            something toward the disposition on their part not to press the
                            requests.</p>
                        <p>I tried to get you by phone this morning but had to leave the house
                            before you were able to come to the phone, and, having to go by and call
                            on Solicitor Johnson (who, by the way is improved) I had not reached the
                            office when you called me here.</p>
                        <p>I was going to ask you whether it would not be well to repeat to Peking
                            our telegram to Guthrie and then give him the substance of our recent
                            communication from Tokio. . . .</p>
                        <p>What answer do you think we ought to make to Guthrie’s telegram, now that
                            we have both it and the enclosed memorandum left by the Japanese
                            Ambassador?</p>
                        <p>It seems to me it might be well for us to present your views on the
                            subject now that these requests have been officially communicated and
                            the following is the way the matter presents itself to me:<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d229fn4">The references in the following paragraphs are to
                                the sections of article V of the demands. For text of the demands,
                                see the undated memorandum from the Chinese Minister, <ref
                                    target="frus1915#pg_93">
                                    <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 93</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0452"/>
                        <p>(Sections Two and Seven need not be considered since they are not
                            objectionable.)</p>
                        <p>One: As to the first, it may be assumed that the Chinese Government would
                            not discriminate unfairly in the employment of advisors—an advisor, of
                            course, having no power to compel the acceptance of the advice
                            given.</p>
                        <p>I do not know of any other Government that asks for the employment of any
                            of its citizens as advisors. Surely this Government does not although it
                            is perfectly willing to have Americans employed by China in any
                            capacity.</p>
                        <p>Third: The Japanese Ambassador informs us, as does Mr. Guthrie, that the
                            paragraph in regard to the employment of Japanese police officers
                            relates to Manchuria only.</p>
                        <p>That was the most menacing of the requests because it did not as
                            published limit the area of their employment and left it to be inferred
                            that Japan desired to share in the general police system of the country.
                            Even as it is, it is objectionable unless it is understood that
                            Manchuria is to pass over entirely to Japan. I am not sure but that it
                            would be worth while for China to agree to the cession of Manchuria to
                            Japan if, by doing so, she could secure freedom as to the rest of the
                            country. As China probably would not be willing to give up Manchuria she
                            would rightfully object to being forced to organize joint police
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Fourth: The proposition that China should buy a certain percentage of her
                            arms of Japan, or establish in China joint Chino-Japanese factories for
                            the manufacture of Chinese arms is, to my mind, quite objectionable.</p>
                        <p>No other country is asking for any such privilege and it is so closely
                            connected with the control of the country as to impair the political
                            independence of China, not to speak of an infringement of the “open
                            door” policy.</p>
                        <p>Fifth: The railway concessions asked for in Paragraph 5 ought not to be
                            granted unless China desires to grant them.</p>
                        <p>In view of the experiences she has had I should think that China would
                            quit granting railroad concessions and build for herself the railroads
                            she needs. If she lets a concession to the capitalists of any country
                            they insist upon extensions and then desire to control the territory
                            through which they go, as, see for instance, the request now being made
                            in the province in which the German road was built.</p>
                        <p>Sixth: The provision asked for in regard to the province of Fukien would
                            virtually close that province to other countries because Japan would not
                            be likely to allow foreign capital to go in there. This would bring
                            another province under Japanese control.</p>
                        <p>In other words, there are two objections to the five requests made:
                            First—that they menace the political integrity of China; and,
                            Second—that <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0453"/>they interfere with
                            the agreement for the equal treatment of all nations.</p>
                        <p>If you think it wise to bring this matter to the attention of Japan we
                            can follow the plan adopted in the last telegram and express
                            gratification that these are not made as demands but merely presented as
                            requests, and, thus, our discussion of them upon their merits will not
                            be objectionable.</p>

                                be wise to let Tokyo have our views by cable, I think, if it can be
                                managed without the intervention of the Press.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: It seems to me that the
                            suggestions made by Mr. Williams in his memorandum of February 26th,
                            which is enclosed,<note n="5" xml:id="d231fn1">Not printed.</note> are
                            worthy of careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>This Government could take the position that, while, it has reason to
                            complain of the Japanese “demands” on China on the ground that they
                            infringe the treaty rights of the United States and are contrary to the
                            formal assurances heretofore made by the Japanese Government, it
                            appreciates the internal pressure of the increasing population of the
                            Empire and the necessity for oversea territory to relieve this pressure
                            by emigration.</p>
                        <p>It could be stated that in the opinion of this Government this necessity
                            for expansion has been in a large measure the cause of Japanese <pb
                                n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0454"/>emigration to the United
                            States, and the underlying reason for the controversies which have taken
                            place over exclusion laws and California land-legislation.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest for your consideration whether it would not be well for
                            this Government to state that if it refrains from urging its undoubted
                            treaty rights relative to Southern Manchuria and Shang Tung, it would do
                            so as a friend of Japan who is solicitous for her welfare, recognizing
                            her economic situation and the relief which would doubtless result from
                            an opportunity to develop Southern Manchuria through Japanese emigrants
                            into that region.</p>
                        <p>It could be further stated that, if this Government adopts such a policy
                            out of friendship for Japan and with an earnest desire to see her wishes
                            accomplished, it may justly expect reciprocal friendly treatment on the
                            part of the Japanese Government, and similar evidence of good will on
                            their part.</p>
                        <p>It could be pointed out that this spirit of friendship could be shown by
                            Japan by a declaration that in view of the announced attitude of the
                            United States in regard to Southern Manchuria and Shan Tung that the

                                <item>Will make no further complaint in regard to legislation

                                    particular trades in these territories, and any preferential
                                    rates or treatment by Japanese railways or other transportation
                                    concerns for the benefit of Japanese subjects or their

                        </p>
                        <p>If a bargain along these lines could be struck it would relieve us of the
                            vexatious California land controversy, and prevent in large measure
                            future disputes which seem almost inevitable if the “demands” of Japan
                            are permitted at the present time to pass unchallenged.</p>
                        <p>In any event can there be any harm in attempting to reach a reciprocal
                            understanding, such as the one outlined above? We would certainly be no
                            worse off than we were before; and I think, even if our proposal is
                            rejected, we would be in a far better position to discuss Japan’s
                            conduct when a more propitious time comes to take up with other
                            interested powers the question of the “Open Door” and the respective
                            rights of the Powers secured through the application of that
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>In view of the situation it has seemed to me advisable to wait until this
                            matter could be considered before preparing a memorandum on the subject
                            of the Japanese “requests”.</p>

                            with the Steel Company for an improvement of a harbor in Fukien.</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be possible to smooth out a good deal of our
                            difficulty by the exchange of notes which would relieve the anxiety of
                            the Japanese people on that point.</p>
                        <p>This Government has no desire to secure a coaling station on the border
                            of Fukien, especially not with a knowledge of Japan’s feeling on the
                            subject—a feeling not so unnatural when you remember that Fukien is
                            opposite Formosa.</p>
                        <p>You will notice on page eight of the memorandum that the Japanese
                            Government seems willing to reconsider the proposal so far as it affects
                            Fukien if it is understood that we will not be a party to any
                            development on the coast which could be construed as a menace to Japan.
                            It is possible that it could be so worded as not to seem to affect the
                            United States, but, rather, be an agreement with China, our nation
                            consenting to the agreement, by which all investment of foreign capital
                            in harbor improvement, or the establishment of coaling stations or naval
                            bases, should be prevented. How does it impress you?</p>
                        <p>I am surprised to learn from the memorandum that Great Britain, France
                            and Germany have already secured agreements identical with those asked
                            by Japan, in Fukien, if not even more restrictive, and at least one of
                            them has been secured since the establishment of the “open door”
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>You will notice that as to the advisors it is only suggestive and Japan
                            disclaims any attempt to coerce China to accept the proposal. There is
                            no objection to the offering of such a suggestion by Japan, and it would
                            naturally produce irritation if China, in selecting advisors, ignored
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of arms, the Ambassador explains that they did not insist
                            upon any particular amount or proportion, but as all arms made in Japan
                            are made by the Government they wanted to know in advance something
                            about how much they would need so that they could make preparation for
                            furnishing them. I believe that this can be obviated by language to the
                            effect that Japan shall not be discriminated against in the purchase of
                            arms and that she should receive notice a certain time in advance of the
                            purchase.</p>
                        <p>In talking with Chinda I believe I discovered the reason for this
                            particular request—namely, that China has been buying her arms of
                            Germany and Austria and I think there was some discussion of plans for
                            the establishment of armor plants by Germans and Austrians. It is not
                            unnatural that they should object to having an enemy providing arms for
                            China.</p>

                        <p>You will notice in Section 3, on <ref target="#pg_4">page 4</ref>, the

                            Mongolia also in certain contingencies.</p>
                        <p>While I hope to have a moment’s time with you tomorrow to consider this

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: It seems to me that it
                            is very clear that the difficulties with regard to Fukien can now be
                            easily cleared away; and I think the suggestions made by Mr. Williams,
                            which as I read them are practically the same as these outlined in your
                            letter, show the way. I am happy to think that we can easily come to an
                            understanding on this point, and remove an impression which ought not to
                            have been [permitted?] so long to exist; I mean the impression created
                            by Mr. Hay’s suggestion as to a coaling station in Fukien.</p>
                        <p>The other matters give me more trouble. Frankly, I do not think that the
                            explanations of the other “requests” which are offered in Ambassador
                            Chinda’s note<note n="11" xml:id="d235fn1">Apparently referring to the
                                memorandum of an oral statement by the Japanese Ambassador forwarded
                                to President Wilson by Secretary Bryan on March 22. See footnote 8,

                            discussion of them by the two governments may result in putting them in
                            a more satisfactory light. I quite understand the motives disclosed. I
                            do not feel like criticising the Japanese Government in regard to them.
                            But I think that the remedies and safeguards proposed in the “requests”
                            go too far. Whatever the intention, they do, in effect constitute a
                            serious limitation upon China’s independence of action, and a very
                            definite preference of Japan before other nations, to whom the door was
                            to be kept open.</p>
                        <p>I shall look forward with pleasure to discussing these points with you
                            when we get Japan’s direct and official reply to our note of
                            inquiry.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps we need not wait for that reply before supplying Guthrie with the
                            answer and the representations he may make in the matter of Fukien.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>You will notice that it is suggested that the arrangement be made between
                            Japan and China, and that this arrangement be then approved by the
                            United States. I submit this idea for your consideration. It seems to me
                            it would be better for us to approve an arrangement between Japan and
                            China than to have this depend entirely upon an agreement between Japan
                            and ourselves. If Japan makes an agreement with China it prevents all
                            other nations from securing concessions on the coast of Fukien, whereas,
                            if it was simply an arrangement between us and Japan it would seem to be
                            a discrimination against us by preventing us while the way would be left
                            open to other nations.</p>
                        <p>I take it for granted that Japan does not want any other nation to
                            establish a naval base there, and by making the arrangement with China
                            all other nations can be excluded.</p>
                        <p>I have had in mind the following addition to the telegram, but, not
                            having had your opinion on the subject I have not included it. If it
                            embodies your wishes, the paragraph can be added. It is as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“If the Japanese Government has any uneasiness as to the development
                                of the interior of Fukien you might inquire whether it would not be
                                advisable to propose that no railroad concession be granted to any
                                foreign power, with the understanding that the Chinese Government
                                shall, itself, build, own and operate any railroads that may be
                                deemed necessary for the development of Fukien, such railroads, if
                                built with borrowed money, not to be mortgaged or in any way pledged
                                to the creditors.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Experience has shown that foreign governments demand a sphere of
                            influence whenever they build a railroad, and these spheres of influence
                            are a menace to the political integrity of China. The arrangement above
                            suggested would probably be welcomed by China as a means of protecting
                            herself from any further complication with foreign powers.<note n="13"

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In the telegram which I
                            have prepared on Fukien I only mention the one “request” which Japan has
                            made of China—namely, the request in regard to Fukien.<note n="14"

                        <p>I am submitting for your consideration another telegram in regard to
                            advisors, arms and police supervision.<note n="15" xml:id="d237fn2">For
                                the telegram as sent, see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> As
                            Japan and China must remain neighbors it is of vital importance that
                            they should be neighborly, and a neighborly spirit cannot be expected if
                            Japan demands too much, or if China concedes too little. It is very
                            evident that each country is suspicious of the other. China is afraid
                            that Japan has ulterior motives, and Japan thinks that the Germans
                            should [<hi rend="italic">would?</hi>] do all in their power to create
                            in China a prejudice against Japan, and it is equally natural that Japan
                            should resent any partiality shown to Germany.</p>
                        <p>It occurs to me that an agreement might be reached on the propositions,
                            if, instead of demanding the appointment of any specific number of
                            advisors, of advisors in any particular capacity, there was an
                            understanding that in the selection of advisors, both as to number and
                            importance, Japan should not be discriminated against as compared with
                            the leading nations.</p>
                        <p>In the same way, instead of agreeing that Japan should furnish a certain
                            percentage of the arms purchased, China could promise not to
                            discriminate against Japan in the purchase of arms, but fairly apportion
                            the purchases among the leading nations or their nationals; sufficient
                            notice—the time to be agreed upon—to be given in advance so as to permit
                            proper arrangements to be made for the fulfilling of the contract.</p>
                        <p>In the matter of joint police supervision, the difficulty seems to lie in
                            a failure to specify either the places or even to limit them to
                            Manchuria and eastern Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>In the verbal explanation it has been stated that this only relates to
                            these provinces and to only certain places in the provinces, but these
                            restrictions do not appear in writing.</p>
                        <p>In the telegram which I enclose, which, like the telegram in regard to
                            the coast of Fukien, has been submitted to both Mr. Lansing and Mr.
                            Williams, I have included a suggestion in regard to police supervision.
                            I am only putting these suggestions in the form of a telegram in order
                            that you may have the idea fairly before you <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414"
                                facs="0460"/>and be in a position either to disapprove it entirely,
                            or to amend the language if the idea is approved.</p>

                            position to consider definitely the requests relating to advisors, arms,
                            and police supervision, but you might tentatively discuss the subject in
                            the following sense if inquiry is made of you in regard to the subjects. <list>
                                <item>First: As to advisors, Japan disclaims any desire to insist
                                    upon an undue or unfair representation, as compared with other
                                    countries, and China, we may assume, does not desire to
                                    discriminate against Japan in the employment of advisors. It
                                    might be possible for the two countries to reach an agreement
                                    whereby China would promise that in the selection of advisors no
                                    discrimination would be made against Japan as compared with
                                    other leading countries, either as to the number of advisors
                                    employed, or as to the subject matter concerning which the
                                    advisors are selected.</item>
                                <item>Second: In the matter of arms a similar arrangement might be
                                    made. As Japan does not desire to insist upon the purchase from
                                    her of an unfair proportion of the arms, and as China has no
                                    reason to desire to discriminate against Japan in the purchase
                                    of arms, the agreement might be so worded that in the purchase
                                    of arms China would not discriminate against Japan as compared
                                    with the other leading powers, either in the amount or kind of
                                    arms purchased, due notice to be given of intended
                                    purchase.</item>
                                <item>Third: If China is disposed to concede police supervision
                                    language should be employed explicitly limiting the application
                                    of this request to Manchuria and eastern Mongolia, and to such
                                    places in these provinces as have a considerable percentage of
                                    Japanese subjects. It might be definitely based upon
                                    proportion—that is, the provision for joint supervision might
                                    automatically become operative when a certain percentage of the
                                    population was made up of Japanese subjects.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The above suggestions are made for your use in case the subjects are
                            brought up for discussion before the matter can be fully treated in the
                            correspondence between the two countries.</p>

                            flimsy of a despatch just received from Tokio. You will see that it puts
                            the Japanese demand in a very different light. You will remember how the
                            despatch from Peking<note n="17" xml:id="d239fn1">

                            to mean that it was to turn over the entire Yangtze Valley to the
                            Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Japanese capitalists have advanced about $40,000,000 for the development
                            of these mines and they are very important to Japan—she not having any
                            iron ore near her. It seems to me that her desire to avoid foreign-owned
                            mines in the immediate vicinity is not unreasonable, provided the
                            concession which she asks is not larger than she describes.</p>
                        <p>The thing that disturbs me most in this eastern trouble is the feeling of
                            suspicion on both sides—a feeling that does not give assurance of peace.
                            These two nations must remain neighbors and unless they deal with each
                            other in the spirit of friendship there is no way of avoiding great
                            antagonism.</p>

                                    119</ref>.</note> Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                yesterday informed me that Japan’s demands touching the
                                Han-yeh-p’ing works are confined substantially to the Taiyeh mine
                                and two other mines in the immediate vicinity of the latter, all of
                                which she believes should be worked together and that Japan depends
                                for her supply of ore chiefly on these mines whose loss would
                                destroy her iron industry. Kato says Japan’s proposition is that if
                                China agreed to the principle of joint control and operation of
                                these mines a joint commission shall be appointed to determine the
                                territory to be included in the concession: that he could not say it
                                would be only “a few miles for it might include a few tens of miles
                                but certainly it would not run into the hundreds.”</p>
                            <p>Previous to my interview the British Ambassador had told me that
                                Baron Kato had given him substantially the same information, Kato’s
                                    <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0462"/>words being that “one
                                could see from the Taiyeh mine the other two mines,” The Ambassador
                                also said that Great Britain had given Japan notice of her
                                established rights in China and as she expected that these would be
                                respected she had not taken any further action although she would
                                have preferred that the negotiations had not been taken up at the
                                present time or at the very least that the Allies had been consulted
                                in advance.</p>
                            <p>Kato told me the negotiations are proceeding steadily though slowly;
                                that China is willing to consent to the acquisition by foreigners of
                                land leases which if long enough would be satisfactory to Japan but
                                still objects to absolute ownership; that she is willing to
                                establish numerous open marts but objects to the responsibility
                                implied in permitting residents in remote country districts; that
                                the differences as to extraterritoriality, land taxation and
                                policing are very near adjustment and that the question of Fukien
                                has not yet been taken up.</p>
                            <p>There has been uneasiness about the Han-yeh-p’ing works for some
                                time, Japan fearing that the owners of the Taiyeh mine might sell
                                its control to some hostile interest and it is believed that
                                recently certain parties did actually endeavor to secure the
                                adjacent mines.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I am very uneasy about what is going on, as reported by Mr. Reinsch . . .
                            I wish that you might find an opportunity to express to the Japanese
                            ambassador the grave concern we feel at hearing that his government is
                            insisting upon the acquiescence of the Chinese government in the
                            “Requests,” because they are so clearly incompatible with the
                            administrative independence and autonomy of the Chinese Empire and with
                            the maintenance of the policy of an open door to the world.</p>
                        <p>In short, I feel that we should be as active as the circumstances permit
                            in showing ourselves to be champions of the sovereign rights of China,
                            now as always, though with no thought of seeking any special advantage
                            or privilege for ourselves. In this way only can we make good this
                            message to Reinsch.</p>
                        <p>Has Reinsch been told definitely that it is not true that we have
                            acquiesced in any of Japan’s demands? Count Okuma has been <pb n="417"

                        <p>But I was thinking yesterday in Cabinet, as Lane was presenting his
                            views, that the real weakness of our influence in this matter lay in the
                                <hi rend="underline">privacy</hi> of our representations to Japan
                            with regard to it. I think, therefore, that it would be wise to say to
                            the Japanese Ambassador that our position with regard to these important
                            matters, of which treaties with China as well as our general interest in
                            the position China is to take in the economic development of her
                            resources give us a right to speak, has been so generally misunderstood
                            and so misleadingly speculated about that we feel that it may become
                            immediately necessary to make our views public, <hi rend="underline"
                                >perhaps</hi> in conjunction with other nations whose interests and
                            sympathies are equally involved; and that we are on that account the
                            more anxious to have a perfectly clear and cordial relationship of
                            mutual understanding <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0464"/>between
                            ourselves and Japan, so that it may be evident from the first that no
                            friction from this source is involved so far as our two governments at
                            present are concerned.</p>
                        <p>This, I am convinced, is the only means we have of reassuring China, our
                            own people, and other governments at present less free than we to
                            protest.</p>
                        <p>I think, too, that we ought to instruct Reinsch to assure the Chinese
                            government that it has our sympathy in resisting any demands which too
                            seriously impinge upon its sovereignty, its administrative independence,
                            or its territorial integrity.</p>

                            confidential memorandum left by the Japanese Ambassador on the morning
                            of April 30th,<note n="23" xml:id="d243fn1">

                                128</ref>.</note> a copy of which I gave you at the Cabinet meeting,
                            I beg to call your attention to the changes which have been made and to
                            submit comments thereon.</p>
                        <p>I do not see that we have any substantial reason for objecting to the
                            claim which Japan makes, that Japanese subjects should be permitted to
                            buy land in South Manchuria; and the same as to paragraph “b” in regard
                            to travel, residence, and the carrying on of business there.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph “c” raises two questions:—You will notice that the Japanese are
                            to produce passports to the Chinese local authorities, and to observe
                            China’s police laws—”or regulations approved by the Japanese consuls”
                            and they are to pay to Chinese authorities “taxes approved by the
                            Japanese consuls.”</p>
                        <p>I called the Ambassador’s attention to the fact that the two clauses
                            which I have placed in quotation marks are susceptible of abuse. To say
                            that the Japanese shall not obey police laws <hi rend="underline">unless
                                those laws are approved by Japanese consuls</hi> is to take away
                            from China the right to make laws controlling Japanese residents, and to
                            say that Japanese need not pay taxes <hi rend="underline">except as
                                approved by the Japanese consuls</hi> is to say that in the
                            sovereign matter of taxation the Japanese shall be subject to Japanese
                            orders. If the Japanese desire to protect themselves against unfair
                            legislation they might ask that Chinese police laws <hi rend="underline"
                                >be not more severe against Japanese than against Chinese;</hi> or
                            that the Chinese police laws shall not be <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419"
                                facs="0465"/>more severe than the police <hi rend="underline">laws
                                enacted by the Japanese for the control of foreigners residing in
                                Japan.</hi> Japan has a right to object to discrimination as between
                            Chinese and Japanese, and in view of the unusual punishment that may be
                            employed in China, she might even justify a demand that her citizens be
                            not subject to more severe laws than those prescribed by Japan herself
                            under the same circumstances; but to say that the regulations must be
                            approved by the Japanese consuls transfers the right of making laws to
                            Japan, acting through her consuls, and may result in serious
                            discriminations in favor of Japanese, which could not fail to create
                            trouble in China.</p>
                        <p>In regard to taxation, it seems to me it would be sufficient to provide
                            that Japanese should not be <hi rend="underline">subject to greater
                                taxation than Chinese.</hi> I suggested this to Chinda and he
                            expressed a fear that China might institute special taxes, applicable
                            only to the business in which Japanese are engaged; but this might be
                            prevented by a provision that the taxes levied on industries in which
                            Japanese are engaged should not be greater than taxes levied upon the
                            same industries elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In other words—what Japan has a right to ask is that there shall be no
                            discrimination against Japanese, but not that exceptional rules shall be
                            made in favor of her people as compared with the rules governing
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The long paragraph following gives, as I understand it, the rule in such
                            cases, and the final clause of the paragraph indicates an intention to
                            leave Japanese to the Chinese courts as soon as the Chinese judicial
                            reforms are brought about.</p>
                        <p>I do not see that we need to refer to Section 3, in regard to Eastern
                            Inner Mongolia.</p>
                        <p>Section 4 related to the Han-yeh-p’ing Company. I think it might be well
                            to express gratification that that demand has been so modified as not to
                            include an option on, or refusal of, mines in the “neighbor-hood.” They
                            drop that out of consideration for our suggestion. The demand as it now
                            stands is very much softened. Paragraph “a” stipulates that China shall
                            approve an agreement that <hi rend="underline">may</hi> be concluded in
                            the future between the Company and the Japanese capitalists. This leaves
                            the matter to the Company and the capitalists. China can avoid the joint
                            undertaking if the Chinese stockholders in the Company fail to conclude
                            an agreement with the capitalists of Japan for the joint holding of the
                            mines.</p>
                        <p>The provision “b”, not to confiscate is, in my opinion, unobjectionable,
                            but to insist that (c) China shall not nationalize the mines “without
                            the consent of the interested Japanese capitalists”—is to deny to China
                            the right of eminent domain, which is essential to sovereignty. Every
                            nation, every state and every municipality ought <pb n="420"
                                xml:id="pg_420" facs="0466"/>to have the right of eminent domain,
                            and so far as I know, they have that right conditioned, of course, upon
                            the payment of damages—no property being taken for public use without
                            just compensation. I do not think that China ought to surrender the
                            right to appropriate any property or industry within her domain upon the
                            payment of just compensation to the owners.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph “d” is unnecessary. If this Company is a joint organization
                            nothing can be done without the consent of both the Chinese and Japanese
                            stockholders, and, therefore, it is unnecessary to say that no loan
                            shall be permitted from any other than Japanese. If China permits the
                            organization of the Company she ought not to prohibit the Company from
                            borrowing from other than Japanese because that would permit the
                            Japanese creditors to close out the Chinese holders at any time.</p>
                        <p>Section 6 deals with the provisions of former Article V, which covered
                            the “requests”. It seems to me that the language of these new requests
                            which are to be “kept on record” is unfortunate. Take “a”, for instance:
                            It reads—“That the Chinese Government will, in case of necessity in the
                            future, employ Japanese advisors.” This might be construed to mean that
                            China engages not to employ any advisors in the future except Japanese
                            advisors, in case advisors are necessary. The Ambassador says that this
                            was not the intention, but in view of the feeling over there it is not
                            well to have any ambiguous language employed.</p>
                        <p>Our suggestion on that point is the only fair basis, it seems to me,
                            namely: that China will not discriminate against Japan in the matter of
                            advisors.</p>
                        <p>I do not see any objection to paragraph “b”, provided it is understood
                            that the land leased or purchased for school buildings and hospitals
                            shall not be used for any other purpose—that is, that they shall not be
                            used for commercial or military purposes.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph “c” is very ambiguous and is quite sure to result in further
                            irritation. Our suggestion here, too, seems to be the only rational
                            basis of agreement—namely, that China shall not discriminate against
                            Japan in the matter of purchase of arms.</p>
                        <p>The request for the establishment of an arsenal in China under Japanese
                            and Chinese management is naturally offensive to China, and if she
                            agreed to send military officers to Japan for that purpose, it would be
                            difficult for the military officers to refuse to make the arrangement
                            when they reached Japan.</p>
                        <p>The request for railways in south China, contained in paragraph “d”,
                            relates to lines about which Great Britain has been consulting, and
                            Japan asks that she be granted these if no objection is made by other
                            powers—evidently relying upon her ability to secure the consent of Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0467"/>
                        <p>In view of the fact that all railroad lines at once demand a sphere of
                            influence, and in view of the danger that these spheres of influence
                            will, if continued to be granted, ultimately deprive China of her own
                            country, I am inclined to think we ought to advise China to build her
                            own railroads with money borrowed by general loans and <hi
                                rend="underline">not by the mortgage of particular property.</hi> I
                            think our capitalists will loan on China’s credit and if our capitalists
                            will loan on this security other capitalists will be compelled to loan
                            on the same terms. This will make China’s loans national, like the loans
                            of other governments, and relieve her of the danger which follows in the
                            wake of these concessions.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph “e”, in regard to the freedom of preaching, is left for future
                            discussion—that would seem to be the most easily granted of all the
                            requests.</p>
                        <p>You will notice that the original proposal for joint administration of
                            police is withdrawn, but I can understand why the Chinese would object
                            more to the privilege which Japan asks for her subjects in Manchuria and
                            Mongolia than she did to the demand for joint police supervision.</p>
                        <p>The provision as to Fukien is in line with our suggestion if the word
                            “other” is left out, so that China will not grant the right to build
                            shipyard, coaling or other naval or military establishment on the coast
                            of Fukien to <hi rend="underline">any</hi> Government. The last part of
                            that clause, however, would seem to bind the Chinese Government not to
                            allow any such establishment to be built with any foreign capital. It
                            seems to me that it would be sufficient to provide that China should not
                            give <hi rend="underline">any agreement or pledge upon any harbor,
                                coaling station, or naval base to any other foreign government.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You will notice that Japan makes no reference to the development of the
                            interior of Fukien. This is in line with our suggestions.</p>
                        <p>The return of Kiaochou to China is, I think, a valuable concession and I
                            do not see that there is any objection to the conditions—first, as to
                            the opening of Tsingtao as a commercial port; and second, to the
                            establishment of a Japanese concession—(that is a place for Japanese
                            settlement)—in the locality to be designated by Japan. I suggested to
                            the Ambassador that this, of course, did not mean that Japan would
                            select the port, and he said, of course not. If the space selected is
                            not too large and is intended for commercial use and residence, like the
                            foreign settlement at Shanghai and the foreign settlement contemplated
                            in these last proposals, I do not see any objection.</p>
                        <p>Taking the document as a whole, and considering the concessions which
                            Japan has made, I think we are justified in believing that she will
                            modify such of the demands as are still unreasonable, and that we ought
                            to so change the letter that we wrote as to call attention to these
                            points.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador was very earnest in his expressions of fear that our
                            reference to the use of the soldiers would be embarrassing, because his
                            Government could not, at this time, withdraw the soldiers lest it might
                            seem an act of weakness, and he evidently did not like to have us make a
                            request which they would have to refuse. I believe that this new
                            statement gives us ground enough for a strong letter and it would seem
                            desirable to make it as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>I would like your opinion on the points to which I have called attention,
                            and the impressions which you have received from reading this latest
                            statement from the Japanese.</p>

                        <p>The President desires that you call upon the Foreign Office and urge that
                            the negotiations between China and Japan shall be conducted in a spirit
                            of patience and friendliness, and be continued until an amicable
                            solution of the existing disputes is found. China and Japan, because of
                            their geographical position must remain neighbors and because of their
                            mutual interests must be friends. It would be most unfortunate if they
                            should be brought into armed conflict, especially at this time when so
                            large a portion of the world is at war. Peaceful means are urged in the
                            conviction that they will, in the end, prove best for both China and
                            Japan and for the rest of the world as well.</p>

                                formed when I was in Japan, and the friendship for and confidence in
                                you which have been built upon that acquaintance, I take the liberty
                                of appealing to you personally and unofficially to use your great
                                influence with your Government to have it deal with China in the
                                spirit of patience. It would be most distressing if China and Japan
                                who, because of their geographical position, must remain neighbors,
                                and because of their mutual interests must be friends, should be

                                attachment to the cause of international peace I most respectfully
                                and most <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0469"/>earnestly urge you

                                will, in the end, prove best for both China and Japan and for the

                            are both alarmed and distressed at the news from Japan and China. Ask
                            whether the British Government will join us in a friendly but earnest
                            appeal to Japan and China to continue their negotiations in the spirit
                            of patience and friendship until a satisfactory conclusion is reached,

                            nations should be drawn into armed conflict; and that as a friend of
                            both nations we feel it our duty to ask the cooperation of other
                            friendly nations in an effort to prevent such a calamity. A similar

                            despatch had its influence in Japan in helping to reduce the severity of
                            the demands. Our despatches from there indicate that the matter is now
                            all settled, which is a great relief at such a time as this.</p>

                            <p>Your telegram May 6th, 7 p. m. and May 6th, 6 p. m. were not
                                delivered to the Embassy till 2 and 6 this morning respectively.
                                Telegraph authorities state delay caused by break of cable which
                                necessitated their being sent by telegraph via Manila, Shanghai and
                                Nagasaki.</p>
                            <p>I presented your personal telegram to Count Okuma at noon today
                                expressing my profound regret at the unavoidable delay in its
                                transmission. After it had been translated to him he asked me to
                                express to you his sincere thanks and to say that he received it in
                                the same friendly spirit in which it had been sent; that he felt
                                sure that on reading the statement which Japan had given out you
                                would realize that she had presented the ultimatum only after
                                exhausting all methods of diplomacy and in the conviction that
                                China’s negotiations were being carried on in a spirit of
                                insincerity; that while the ultimatum had now been issued Japan had
                                with it offered even further concessions which would make it
                                possible for China to yield and that he had strong hope of a
                                peaceful outcome.</p>
                            <p>An hour ago the British Ambassador read me a telegram he had received
                                this morning from Sir Edward Grey reporting the latter’s conference
                                on Friday with the Japanese Ambassador in London when <pb n="426"
                                    xml:id="pg_426" facs="0472"/>Sir Edward had urged strongly that
                                war at the present time would be most serious for the whole Far East
                                and might mean even the break-up of China and had counselled
                                patience and conciliation. He read me also a telegram he had just
                                received from the British Minister at Peking stating “I have
                                strongly urged the Chinese Government to accept terms of ultimatum
                                and I am convinced that they will do so”. The British Ambassador
                                himself appears confident of a peaceful solution.</p>

                        <p>To neither of the Ambassadors did I express any opinion as to what the
                            attitude of this Government would be. I confess that I am at a loss to
                            understand the purpose of Japan in this action which has been taken.
                            Perhaps I am very suspicious and that it has the object of preserving
                            the peace in the far east. My own view is that it is not an action on
                            their part to which we should make any objection. In fact I believe if
                            it accomplishes its purpose it will be beneficial. Our reports while
                            varied tend to show that the proclamation of Yuan Shih Kai as Emperor
                            would cause insurrections in various parts of China. He is, to all
                            intents, Emperor at the present time and I can see no reason other than
                            ambition for the continuance of his family in power for the assumption
                            of the title.</p>
                        <p>I do not think it is necessary for us to take any action in the matter
                            other than to acknowledge the receipt of these papers. As it is a
                            matter, however, of considerable moment I would be obliged if you would
                            give me your views on the subject.</p>

                        <p>Ministers of the Chinese Government today expressed to me great concern
                            over the report, as yet unconfirmed, that the Japanese Government is
                            making <hi rend="italic">démarches</hi> at Washington, London, St.
                            Petersburg, and Paris with a view to making joint representations to the
                            Chinese Government, counselling suspension of monarchist movement as
                            being inopportune and likely to lead to disturbances. The report further
                            indicates an attempt on the part of the Japanese Government to have
                            Entente Powers commit into its hands the conduct of affairs connected
                            with contemplated change of Government under a promise by Japan to guard
                            foreign interests generally in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>It is apprehended that the Japanese Government may be aiming to
                            manipulate the present situation so as to give itself the position,
                            vis-à-vis the Powers, of a maintainer of the peace of the Far East, and,
                            vis-à-vis the Chinese, that of protector without whose assent and
                            assistance no important action may be taken. The Ministers of the
                            Entente Powers here have seen this danger for some time, but are, in <pb
                                n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0474"/>the nature of things, powerless
                            of themselves to prevent such a development.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government maintain that the question of the form of state is
                            a purely domestic one, which could be turned into a matter of
                            international action only for unjustifiable reason of foreign political
                            ambitions, since they feel assured that no disturbances will occur
                            unless through foreign instigation and that foreign interests are
                            therefore in no sense endangered or involved at all. Japan’s assertion
                            of vital interest in domestic policies of China would in itself amount
                            to a claim of virtual suzerainty.</p>
                        <p>I venture to suggest that even if the Department should consider it
                            desirable to make some intimation to the Chinese Government in this
                            connection, it would be highly important that any such action should be
                            taken independently so as to avoid associating our Government with a
                            program which has in view an ulterior object decidedly unfavorable to
                            American interests.</p>

                        <p>It would appear from this that the Chinese Government had decided to

                            was reached prior to the protest by Japan and the entente powers it is
                            impossible to say, but in view of the usual delay of the Chinese in
                            presenting communications of this sort I assume that this telegram came
                            through before Japan and the other powers had acted.</p>
                        <p>I declined to give the Minister any opinion upon the matter, saying that

                            government, however radical, is wholly a domestic question and that it
                            would in our opinion be a serious breach of China’s sovereignty to
                            undertake any form of interference or even protest without such
                            evidences as are now wholly lacking that foreign interests would be

                            feeling that this is a most critical time in the affairs of the whole

                        <p>Referring to my cable of November 27, 10 p. m.<note n="34"
                                xml:id="d256fn1">Not printed.</note> Situation still uncertain, but
                            there are some indications that Great Britain is not receiving strong
                            support from Russia in the endeavor to hold Japan to strictly joint
                            action in Far Eastern affairs, since Russia appears to feel only a
                            moderate interest in China proper as long as her position in the north
                            is safe. This isolation of British influence, which was accentuated by
                            the premature publication of the Entente plan, is believed to have
                            encouraged Japan to make counterproposals involving complete freedom of
                            action in China and the consequent tacit recognition of her practical
                            suzerainty over China, which the Japanese press is already loudly
                            asserting. The preoccupation of Great Britain in Europe, the fact that
                            Japan could easily become dangerous to her in Asia, the indifference of
                            Russia, the endeavors of Germany further to weaken British influence in
                            China and to keep China from joining the Allies, leave growing material
                            power of Japan the one positive factor in the situation, foreshadowing
                            irretrievable loss of European influence in China should the war
                            continue. American interests <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0476"
                            />would suffer together with European and the question arises whether it
                            is, under the circumstances possible to give sufficient backing to the
                            European Entente Powers enabling them to preserve the status of
                            International Rights in China and of Chinese sovereignty itself intact
                            until the end of the war.</p>

                            that the interests and the treaty rights of the United States would be
                            very directly and unfavourably affected by the foreshadowed change of
                            political suzerainty in China, and that this is the time to let Japan
                            understand, in all friendly frankness, how we should look upon efforts
                            on her part to gain further control of China. Is not this your

                        <p>The Special Ambassador and I conferred this afternoon for an hour and a
                            half at the Department.</p>
                        <p>During the first part of the conference the subject discussed was to what
                            extent Japan had rendered aid in the war, and how it might cooperate
                            more fully with the Allies and this country.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I considered the great problem was <hi rend="underline"
                                >transportation,</hi> and that it seemed to me Japan might be able
                            to do more than she had done in this matter.</p>
                        <p>He replied that Japan was doing a good deal to aid and that they had
                            chartered several hundred tons of shipping to the Allies which was being
                            used in the Mediterranean trade.</p>
                        <p>He then spoke of the fact that we had embargoed iron and steel and that
                            it was causing not only dissatisfaction but much distress in Japan on
                            account of its absolute need in the shipyards of that country, which
                            have been greatly increased in capacity.</p>
                        <p>I explained to him that this Embargo had been made necessary by the fact
                            that steel was being used largely in the manufacture of munitions and in
                            the increased output of shipping in this country; that of course we had
                            to look out first for our own interests in that particular; that again
                            transportation entered into the problem in that we had to depend upon
                            scrap-steel on the Pacific coast for our shipyards there or else bring
                            it from the east, which was very difficult as our rolling stock was
                            short. I went on to say that possibly some arrangement could be made for
                            the release of a certain amount of steel to Japan, provided Japan would
                            transfer to us some of the ships already constructed, as it was a matter
                            of immediate importance to us to obtain shipping, and it was a matter of
                            immediate importance to Japan to obtain material. I said that while I
                            could not speak with accuracy about these matters I believed that we
                            might be able to supply steel to build vessels which would have a
                            combined greater tonnage than the vessels they would transfer to us.</p>
                        <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0479"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he was not sure whether this could be arranged, but
                            he thought it was very well worthy of consideration and that we could
                            take it up more in detail later.</p>
                        <p>It was very evident that the industrial situation in Japan was chiefly in
                            his mind and I thought the suggestion such as I made appealed to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>We further discussed the possibility of utilizing Japan’s tonnage for the
                            transportation to Russia of railroad material and munitions.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he felt that this could very well be done and his
                            Government would be glad to aid in the matter. At the same time he said
                            it was a more or less technical matter and he could only speak as an
                            amateur.</p>
                        <p>I told him I was in very much the same situation and that of course our
                            conversation was entirely informal and tentative.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador whether he desired to discuss other questions than
                            those immediately pertaining to the war, because if he so desired I was
                            willing to do so—but I thought the supreme object of both Governments at
                            the present moment should be the winning of the war and an understanding
                            as to how we could cooperate to that end.</p>
                        <p>He said that in view of the fact that he had come here and been so
                            handsomely received by the American people he thought it would be
                            unfortunate not to consider some of the other questions as we had to
                            look forward to a time when the war would be over. He said in the first
                            place he ought to inform me that when he returned to Japan from France,
                            where he was Ambassador in 1915, he stopped in London and saw Sir Edward
                            Grey. Japan at that time had taken Kaio Chau and the German Islands in
                            the South Pacific. He said he told Sir Edward Grey it was the intention
                            of his Government to return Kaio Chau to China, but that no Government
                            in Japan could stand if they did not retain some of the South Sea
                            Islands as “souvenirs” of the war; that it had been a sacrifice for his
                            Government to enter the war, which they were not compelled to do under
                            their treaty of alliance—that is according to the letter of the
                            treaty—but he thought they were according to the spirit. He then went on
                            to say that Sir Edward Grey had practically consented in the
                            readjustment of territory after the war; that the German Islands north
                            of the equator should be retained by Japan, while those south of the
                            equator should go to Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was glad to know this and appreciated his frankness in
                            telling me, but that I could make no comment on such an agreement at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>I asked him what further questions he wished to discuss and he said to
                            me: “Have you anything to propose in regard to China?”</p>
                        <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>I replied that I had and while I realized that he would want to consider
                            my proposition before making a reply I would like to present it. I said
                            the proposition was this:</p>
                        <p>That the co-belligerents against Germany should, jointly or
                            simultaneously, re-declare the “Open Door” policy in a statement which
                            would have a very beneficial effect upon China and I believed upon the
                            world at large, as it was in accord with the principles of commerce to
                            which we all agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador seemed a little taken aback by this suggestion and said
                            that of course he should like to consider it and that he appreciated the
                            arguments in its favor although he said he did not know as it was
                            absolutely necessary in view of the fact that Japan had always lived up
                            to the principle.</p>
                        <p>I replied that Japan had always lived up to any declaration which she had
                            made; that the good faith of Japan could not be questioned; and that
                            upon that this Government always relied and felt no anxiety once the
                            Japanese Government had passed its word.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he felt that Japan had a special interest on
                            account of its position in regard to China, and while its desire was to
                            have China open and free to all countries he felt there might be
                            criticism if there was a bare declaration of the “Open Door” policy
                            without some mention of Japan’s special interest.</p>
                        <p>I replied to him that we recognized the fact that Japan, from her
                            geographical position, had a peculiar interest in China but that to make
                            a declaration to that effect seemed to me needless as it was the result
                            of natural causes and not political; that any such declaration might be
                            interpreted as a peculiar political interest and I was very doubtful
                            whether it would be wise to include it in a reaffirmation of the “Open
                            Door” policy.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that his Government was of course in favor of the
                            “Open Door” policy; that they would maintain it as they had in the past,
                            but he was not willing yet to say whether he thought it would be a real
                            advantage to reaffirm it.</p>
                        <p>I said that the “Open Door” policy was peculiarly advantageous to Japan;
                            that if we should return to spheres of influence in which the various
                            powers had a paramount interest in certain sections of China the
                            advantage which Japan had in geographical position would be destroyed;
                            that Japan, with the industrial advantage which she had by reason of
                            cheap and efficient labor and the short distance which she had to carry
                            her goods to the Chinese markets, benefited more than any other of the
                            countries by the “Open Door” policy; that so far as this country was
                            concerned it might be considered advisable to reestablish spheres of
                            influence, but that it was entirely contrary to our policy and principle
                            and we were most anxious <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0481"/>to
                            preserve the doctrine in dealing with China. I said I hoped he would
                            give the matter very careful consideration and would be prepared to
                            discuss it further at our next conference, which is to take place on
                            Monday, September 10th.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the early part of the conversation the Ambassador
                            said that through various channels the German Government had three times
                            sought to persuade Japan to withdraw from the Allies and to remain
                            neutral, but that in every case his Government had firmly rejected the
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that I could imagine their seeking some such step as they
                            had planned to attempt it through Mexico as was indicated in the
                            Zimmermann note.<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">

                            no concern to this Government, in view of the fact that Japan’s loyalty
                            to an ally, and her reputation for good faith was too well established
                            to be even suspected.</p>

                            preliminary remarks he introduced the subject of the “Open Door” and the
                            suggestion that a redeclaration at this time would be advantageous.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had heard from his Government and that they did not wish
                            to do anything to affect the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in China
                            and that it would be hard to explain to the Japanese people why a
                            declaration was made at this time if the suggestion was adopted.</p>
                        <p>I told him that he must realize that in the present state of the world
                            Japan and the United States were the only countries which could furnish
                            money for the development of China’s vast resources; that, if we
                            permitted the gradual restoration of the policy of “spheres of
                            influence”, which seemed to be going on, the Allied Governments would
                            look upon us as seeking to monopolize the opportunities; and that it
                            seemed to me that we should unite in every possible way to dispel the
                            impression that we would selfishly seek to take advantage of their
                            wasted condition and build up our own fortunes without thought of those
                            who were fighting the battles of this country and of Japan, as well as
                            their own battles. I said that I thought this was a time when Japan and
                            the United States ought to show a magnanimous spirit and say to them,
                            “We will not take advantage of your calamities as we might do. We will
                            seek no special privileges in China. When this <pb n="436"
                                xml:id="pg_436" facs="0482"/>war is over and you begin to rebuild
                            your fortunes by commerce and trade, you will find the markets of China
                            and the opportunities in that land as open and free to you as they are
                            to us.” If we redeclared the “Open Door” policy, I told him that is what
                            it would mean, and I asked him if it was not worth while to gain the
                            gratitude and confidence of the Allies by an announcement of our purpose
                            to be generous and unselfish in this time when the future must look so
                            dark to them.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount said that he appreciated all this and that he also realized
                            what I had said before about Japan being the chief beneficiary from the
                            “Open Door” which was manifestly true, but that the Japanese people
                            would be likely to blame the Government if there was nothing said about
                            Japan’s “special interest” in China, that the opposition in the Diet
                            would seize upon such an opportunity to attack the Ministry for making a
                            needless declaration, while getting nothing for Japan.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that if he meant by “special interest” “paramount
                            interest”, I could not see my way clear to discuss the matter further;
                            but, if he meant a special interest based upon geographical position, I
                            was not unwilling to take the matter into consideration. I said further
                            that I appreciated his difficulty which pertained to the political
                            situation in Japan and would try and find some formula to satisfy the
                            wishes of his people in case a redeclaration of the “Open Door” policy
                            could be agreed upon in principle.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount said that he wished I would prepare such a formula first for
                            his consideration and I told him that I would. He seemed to be much
                            impressed with the idea that to redeclare the “Open Door” at this time
                            would be accepted as a generous act by the Allies and strengthen the
                            bond of friendship and confidence between the powers and Japan. He also
                            said that he was convinced that Japan on account of its proximity to
                            China would be especially benefited by a continuance of the “Open Door”
                            policy, and that the only difficulty of the proposed redeclaration was
                            that it might not appeal to the Japanese public and be used as a pretext
                            to attack the Government.</p>
                        <p>In this conversation I also said to him that there seemed to be a
                            misconception of the underlying principle of the “Monroe Doctrine”; that
                            it was not an assertion of primacy or of paramount interest by the
                            United States in its relation to other American Republics; that its
                            purpose was to prevent foreign powers from interfering with the
                            sovereign rights of any nation in this hemisphere; and that the whole
                            aim was to preserve to each republic the power of self-development. I
                            said further that so far as aiding in this development this country was
                            on an equal footing with all other countries and claimed no special
                            privileges.</p>
                        <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0483"/>
                        <p>As for China I said that I felt that the same principle should be applied
                            and that no special privileges and certainly no paramount interest in
                            that country should be claimed by any foreign power. I also said that I
                            appreciated the pressure of population in Japan and the need for
                            industrial expansion, and that I believed that Japan had occupied Korea
                            and was developing Manchuria chiefly because of this unavoidable
                            necessity.</p>
                        <p>The Special Ambassador spoke of Manchuria and said that his country
                            desired the “Open Door” policy to be applied there, that his Government
                            sought no monopoly there, and that even if China was willing to cede the
                            territory to Japan, Japan would not accept it.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I was glad to hear this frank declaration and I hoped
                            that his view of the application of the “Open Door” policy was the same
                            as mine. My view was that in China foreign commerce and trade should be
                            entirely unhampered. He replied that was his view. I then said that I
                            felt that when a railroad or canal was built in China by the nationals
                            of one country special rates or other privileges should not be given to
                            citizens of that country engaged in trade or industry in China, but that
                            the citizens of all countries should receive identical treatment. The
                            Ambassador assented to this with some hesitation, and seemed desirous to
                            avoid a discussion of the application of the principle of the “Open
                            Door”,</p>
                        <p>We discussed other subjects, but they were of minor importance.</p>

                        <p>Early this morning I sent to Viscount Ishii a draft of a note,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d265fn1">This draft not printed.</note> embodying the
                            formula which I had said in our previous conference I would prepare, and
                            which, if it met with his approval and that of his Government, was to be
                            formally communicated to him and by him formally confirmed.</p>
                        <p>By appointment the Viscount called upon me in the afternoon at the
                            Department, because he was later to be received by the President. He
                            brought with him the draft of note and said that in general it met with
                            his approval but that he had a few changes which he would like to
                            suggest.</p>
                        <p>Appended is a copy of the draft with the changes which were finally
                            agreed upon between us. . . .</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Having very quickly reached a complete agreement in regard to the form of
                            the note we compared our respective copies to be sure our changes were
                            alike.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount then said that he would at once cable the text to his
                            Government and ask their consent to confirm it if it should be formally
                            sent to him. He also said that he hoped that the text could be given
                            publicity simultaneously in Washington and Tokio. I said that I would be
                            very glad to have such an arrangement, as so important and epochal
                            agreement should be given out to both peoples at the same time.</p>
                        <p>I further told Ishii that it was possible that China might be willing to
                            send 40,000 or 50,000 troops to Europe to be used by the Allies in
                            certain classes of work and that I thought, if it was decided upon, that
                            this country and Japan would have to cooperate <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0485"/>and ought to cooperate in making such
                            an enterprise successful. He seemed to be a little surprised at my
                            statement but only asked how we could cooperate. I replied that we would
                            have to furnish the money to equip and supply the force and that Japan
                            ought to contribute by providing transportation. He said that the whole
                            idea was new to him, and that he did not see how China could spare any
                            troops at the present time of domestic unrest to go so far away. I
                            replied that frequently troops were a cause of unrest, at least such
                            forces as were of uncertain loyalty, and it might be well in some
                            circumstances to have them otherwise employed than at home. While he did
                            not dissent I saw that he was not favorably inclined to the idea.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, while I knew his Government was most anxious to
                            cooperate in every possible way in the war, he was not sure that it had
                            available ships to transport Chinese troops on so long a voyage. I
                            replied that I did not expect him to decide so important a question now,
                            that I had only mentioned it as a possibility, and that I would not have
                            done so before the matter took shape but for the fact that I wished to
                            lay everything before him with the same frankness which he had exhibited
                            in our conversations. I went on to say that his sincerity and candor had
                            profoundly impressed me and that his broad-mindedness and unreserved
                            statements had done more than had been done by any representative of
                            Japan to remove the suspicions which had unquestionably arisen in this
                            country as to the purposes of his Government. I said further that I
                            hoped he would carry back to Japan a similar feeling of trust and
                            goodwill for the United States and could impress upon his countrymen
                            that they have no truer or more loyal friends than the Americans.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount said that any doubts which had existed in his mind had been
                            entirely removed by the genuine expressions of friendship and the lavish
                            hospitality with which he had been received everywhere and that he would
                            not only return to his country convinced of the goodwill of the United
                            States but would endeavor to impress it upon the people of Japan.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that both our countries had suffered from the sinister
                            activities of the Germans, who had undoubtedly been at work for a decade
                            or perhaps two decades, poisoning the minds of both Governments and
                            peoples with rumors of hostile intent and endeavoring to cause a barrier
                            of suspicion between the two countries. We were both ignorant of these
                            agents and naturally fell victims to the plausible stories which they
                            told; we had been drifting further and further apart and seeing in the
                            acts of the other evil motives which never existed; but those days had
                            passed; we now knew the source of these <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"
                                facs="0486"/>falsehoods, which are in line with the character of
                            German diplomacy. I said—“We now are closer friends than ever
                            before.”</p>
                        <p>Viscount Ishii replied with warmth that he entirely agreed with me as to
                            the vile part the Germans had played in our relations, and that he
                            should use his whole influence to counteract the great wrong which had
                            been done to both countries; that we had both been too easily deceived;
                            and that, if we had only been frank with each other, all our differences
                            would have long ago disappeared as they have now.</p>
                        <p>I then bade the Viscount goodbye with expressions of personal regard,
                            which he returned in kind.</p>
                        <p>(He leaves tomorrow morning for New York and probably will not return to
                            Washington.)</p>

                            </head>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to
                                communicate herein my understanding of the agreement reached by us
                                in our recent conversations touching the questions of mutual
                                interest to our Governments relating to the Republic of China.</p>
                            <p>Charges have repeatedly been made of late, some accusing the United
                                States and others Japan of seeking to take advantage of present
                                world conditions to acquire political influence or control in China.
                                The Governments of the United States and Japan having always
                                recognized China as a sovereign and independent state, resent such
                                accusations as offensive and as wholly unjustified.</p>
                            <p>In order to silence such mischievous reports, however, it is believed
                                by us that a public announcement once more of the desires and
                                intentions shared by our two Governments with regard to China is
                                advisable.</p>
                            <p>The Governments of the United States and Japan recognize that
                                territorial propinquity creates special relations between countries;
                                and consequently the United States Government recognizes that Japan
                                has a special interest in China, particularly in that part to which
                                her possessions are contiguous. The territorial sovereignty of
                                China, nevertheless, remains unimpaired and the Government of the
                                United States has every confidence in the repeated assurances of the
                                Imperial Japanese Government that, while geographical position gives
                                them such special interest they have no desire to discriminate
                                against the trade of other nations or to disregard the commercial
                                rights heretofore granted by China in treaties with other
                                Powers.</p>
                            <p>The Governments of the United States and Japan deny that they have
                                any purpose to infringe in any way the independence or territorial
                                integrity of China and they declare furthermore that they <pb
                                    n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0487"/>always adhere to the
                                principle of the so-called “Open Door”, or equal opportunity for
                                commerce and industry in China, and that they will not take
                                advantage of present conditions to seek special rights or privileges
                                in China which would abridge the rights of the citizens or subjects
                                of other friendly States. Moreover they mutually declare that they
                                are opposed to the acquisition by any other government of any
                                special rights or privileges that would affect the independence or
                                territorial integrity of China or that would deny to the subjects or
                                citizens of any country the full enjoyment of equal opportunity in
                                the commerce and industry of China.</p>
                            <p>They furthermore agree to bring this declaration to the attention of
                                other interested governments and invite those Governments to give
                                their adherence to these declarations.</p>
                            <p>I shall be glad to have Your Excellency confirm this understanding of
                                the agreement reached by us.</p>

                        <p>On the 8th Viscount Ishii left with me a draft of the proposed note from
                            this Government to Japan, showing in lead pencil the changes desired by
                            his Government in the note. (The document is hereto attached.)<note

                        <p>The Viscount called upon me this morning and asked if I had had an
                            opportunity to consider the changes proposed. I told him that I had and
                            that so far as striking out the second paragraph on the first page<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d267fn2">

                            making the insertion which he proposed it would be agreeable to this
                            Government.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>As to the next change, which appears on the third page of the document, I
                            said that while I admitted the phrase which his Government desired to
                            have eliminated<note n="9" xml:id="d267fn3">Beginning “and that they
                                will not take advantage,” <ref target="#pg_441">p. 441</ref>, 1.
                                2.</note> would not materially affect the document, it seemed to me
                            that both Governments were losing a very great opportunity of placing
                            themselves in a generous light before the Allied Powers.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount replied he realized that, but that there were political
                            reasons at home which he felt embarrassed his Government in accepting
                            the phrase as it stood, especially as the preceding declarations cover
                            the entire ground.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that while I felt that was so, the direct declaration that
                            neither of the Governments would seek advantage during the war would
                            receive the greatest applause in the Allied countries; that those
                            countries were in difficult financial situations; that they were almost
                            on the verge of bankruptcy; that Japan and the United States were the
                            only countries who could use their resources in the development of
                            China; and that it would be a noble and generous act to say to these
                            countries—“You have been fighting our battles and we will not take
                            advantage of your condition but will hold your rights sacred and give
                            you every opportunity to recover from this war along commercial and
                            industrial lines in the Far East.”</p>
                        <p>The Viscount replied to this that he was in full accord with me, but in
                            view of his Government’s desires he could not commit them to an
                            acceptance of the phrase; but that he would immediately telegraph and
                            explain the advantage of retaining it.</p>
                        <p>I said to him that of course it might be found politically impossible to
                            concede this request, although it affected both nations equally; that I
                            only saw one other way of making the document complete in case that
                            phrase was rejected and that was to strike out the word <hi
                                rend="underline">“other”</hi> in the 4th line from the bottom of
                                <ref target="#pg_3">page 3</ref>;<note n="10" xml:id="d267fn4">

                                6.</note> and that while I hoped his Government would not feel
                            compelled to reject the clause proposed, especially as it only applied
                            to the present time, it might not be inadvisable to consider the
                            alternative proposal of striking out the word “other”.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount said he would bear this in mind and also communicate with
                            his Government.</p>
                        <p>We then discussed the matter of better telegraphic communication between
                            Japan and the United States, and I made the suggestion to him that it
                            might be advisable to appoint a joint commission of four to consider the
                            subject, in order that they might work out a general plan of wireless
                            and cable communication which would materially <pb n="443"
                                xml:id="pg_443" facs="0489"/>reduce the present rates and expedite
                            the transmission of information.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount said he would communicate this to his Government at once and
                            that it met with his approval.</p>
                        <p>I asked him if there had ever been any communication with any of the
                            Allied Powers in regard to the military participation of Japan in the
                            war. He said that almost three years ago the matter had been broached by
                            Great Britain informally but that his Government had pointed out at that
                            time the impossibility of maintaining a force at any considerable
                            distance from Japan. I asked him if there had been any later
                            communications and he said not to his knowledge. I therefore let the
                            matter drop.</p>
                        <p>He left with the understanding that as soon as he had received a reply
                            from his Government he would see me again.</p>

                        <p>Viscount Ishii called at the Department by appointment this morning.</p>
                        <p>He first said that I probably knew that the Japanese Naval Commissioner
                            had arranged with our naval authorities to take over certain patrol duty
                            in the Pacific now being performed by the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Saratoga</hi> in order that the latter might be released for
                            service in the Atlantic, but that his Government desired the arrangement
                            be confirmed formally through the Department of State. I told him I
                            would communicate at once with the Navy Department and take the
                            necessary steps.</p>
                        <p>He then said that he had received a communication from his Government and
                            that, rather than vary the language of the Root–Takahira agreement<note

                            “other” in the fourth line from the bottom.<note n="15" xml:id="d268fn5"

                        <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0490"/>
                        <p>I told him that I was of course disappointed at the omission of so
                            important a declaration at this time, as I knew the President would be,
                            but that the retention of the clause relating to “sovereignty” and the
                            elimination of the word “other” indicated to me that his Government were
                            desirous of reaching an agreement.</p>
                        <p>He said that I must know how sincerely he was in favor of the declaration
                            and how he had urged his Government to retain it, but that they seemed
                            to fear domestic criticism, although he seemed to be very vague as to
                            what the criticism would be.</p>
                        <p>I said that, if the declaration had not been in the draft, it would
                            matter very little, but having been submitted to Japan and rejected it
                            might convey a very wrong impression, that the President felt this very
                            strongly and I hoped they would exchange confidential notes on the
                            subject as I had suggested.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount replied that he had already presented the suggestion to his
                            Government and that they did not deem it wise to do so. He then produced
                            the paper which is annexed<note n="16" xml:id="d268fn6">Not
                                printed.</note> and read to me the argument presented against an
                            exchange of confidential notes. He handed me the paper and I read it
                            again.</p>
                        <p>When I had finished I told him that I did not consider the arguments very
                            substantial, but that I would like to consider the matter further, and
                            after doing so, I would consult with the President, who I knew would be
                            disappointed that his Government were unwilling to take a course which
                            would remove all possibility of future misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had hoped to persuade his Government to take one of the
                            two courses which I had suggested, but that he had been unable to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>I told him I appreciated the efforts which he had made, that I thought
                            the amendments which he had obtained from his Government had brought the
                            negotiation to an almost successful conclusion, and that I was still
                            hopeful of finding a way which would be satisfactory to both
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>I said that I would ask another conference as soon as I could explain the
                            situation to the President.</p>

                                Republic of China, which are of mutual interest to Japan and the
                                United States and which, on September 26, 1917, was submitted by the
                                Government of the United States to the Government of Japan for their
                                consideration, there appeared, following the declaration by the two
                                Governments of their adherence to the so-called “Open Door” policy,
                                a further declaration “that they will not take advantage of present
                                conditions to seek special rights and privileges in China which
                                would abridge the rights of the citizens or subjects of other
                                friendly states.”</p>
                            <p>For certain reasons of expediency, which have been orally explained
                                to the Government of the United States, the Government of Japan
                                considered it to be unwise to include the above-quoted declaration
                                in the proposed note, and it was, therefore, stricken out by mutual
                                consent.</p>
                            <p>In order, however, to avoid misconstruction being placed upon this
                                amendment of the note, the Government of Japan desire to affirm that
                                by doing so there was no purpose on their part to assert a contrary
                                principle or policy, and that the elimination of the declaration has
                                no significance whatsoever in determining the terms of the note as
                                finally agreed upon by the two Governments.</p>

                        <p>The Viscount called at the Department by request and I told him that the
                            note as finally agreed upon on the 20th was acceptable in <pb n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446" facs="0492"/>itself, but that the President was
                            seriously concerned over the elimination of the declaration following
                            the one referring to the “Open Door” policy unless some statement was
                            made in regard to it. I said that, as I understood that his Government
                            were opposed to an exchange of confidential notes on the subject, I
                            would suggest that there should accompany the Japanese reply a
                            memorandum, which I could retain in my confidential files. I then
                            produced a draft of memorandum such as I had in mind and read it to him.
                            (A copy of the paper is annexed.)<note n="18" xml:id="d270fn1">

                        </p>
                        <p>The Viscount, to whom I handed a copy, read it through very carefully and
                            said that he would submit it to his Government.</p>
                        <p>I then handed him the redraft of the note which I had made on the 20th
                            (of which a copy is annexed).</p>
                        <p>He spoke of the elimination of the word “other” and asked if I did not
                            think it well to retain it. I told him “No”, and he dropped the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>He asked if the ending of the note would be the same as the Root-Takahira
                            agreement and I told him that I had not thought about the matter, but
                            would let him know the next time we met.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to
                                communicate herein my understanding of the agreement reached by us
                                in our recent conversations touching the questions of mutual
                                interest to our Governments relating to the Republic of China.</p>
                            <p>In order to silence the mischievous reports that have from time to
                                time been circulated, it is believed by us that a public
                                announcement once more of the desires and intentions shared by our
                                two Governments with regard to China is advisable.</p>
                            <p>The Governments of the United States and Japan recognize that
                                territorial propinquity creates special relations between countries,
                                and, consequently, the Government of the United States recognizes
                                that Japan has special interests in China, particularly in the part
                                to which her possessions are contiguous.</p>
                            <p>The territorial sovereignty of China, nevertheless, remains
                                unimpaired and the Government of the United States has every
                                confidence in the repeated assurances of the Imperial Japanese
                                Government that while geographical position gives Japan such special
                                interests they have no desire to discriminate against the trade of
                                    <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0493"/>other nations or to
                                disregard the commercial rights heretofore granted by China in
                                treaties with other powers.</p>
                            <p>The Governments of the United States and Japan deny that they have
                                any purpose to infringe in any way the independence or territorial
                                integrity of China and they declare, furthermore, that they always
                                adhere to the principle of the so-called “Open Door” or equal
                                opportunity for commerce and industry in China.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, they mutually declare that they are opposed to the
                                acquisition by any Government of any special rights or privileges
                                that would affect the independence or territorial integrity of China
                                or that would deny to the subjects or citizens of any country a<note

                        <p>The Viscount called this morning by appointment and said that he had
                            heard from his Government as to the proposed memorandum submitted on the
                            24th [<hi rend="italic">22d</hi>] by me, that he wished to repeat that
                            the only thing his Government sought to avoid was the impression that we
                            suspected Japan of improper motives, and that his Government were afraid
                            that the memorandum might some day become public and people would
                            believe that we did not trust Japan. He was, therefore, instructed to
                            propose a protocol, which would be in the nature of a joint memorandum
                            signed by both of us.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount then handed me the draft of a protocol (which is
                                annexed)<note n="21" xml:id="d271fn1">Not printed; for text of the

                            further than the memorandum.</p>

                        <p>He also spoke about the communication which was to be made by the

                            another interview with Viscount Ishii. As you know I submitted to him
                            last Monday a memorandum relative to the important clause which had been
                            stricken out of the note to be sent him. He submitted the matter to his
                            Government and has received a proposed protocol instead of the
                            memorandum suggested by me. I enclose a copy for your
                                consideration.<note n="22" xml:id="d272fn1">Not printed.</note> It
                            is my view that this practically covers the ground and of course avoids
                            the idea of suspicion as to Japan’s purpose which might have been drawn
                            from the memorandum submitted by us.</p>
                        <p>This protocol would be signed by the Viscount and myself and retained
                            confidentially, but he informs me that his Government does not feel it
                            would have to be kept as secret as a memorandum such as we proposed.</p>
                        <p>I would be obliged if you could indicate your wishes as soon as possible
                            as Viscount Ishii is very anxious to set out on his homeward
                            journey.</p>

                        <p>At my request the Viscount called this afternoon and I informed him that
                            I had given careful consideration to the proposed protocol which he had
                            handed me on the 27th<note n="23" xml:id="d273fn1">See footnote 21, <ref
                                    target="#pg_447">p. 447</ref>.</note> and that I had also
                            discussed the matter with the President, who agreed with my conclusions.
                            I said to him that I should like to have changed the last paragraph so
                            that it would read:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“It was, however, well understood that the principle enunciated in
                                the clause which was thus suppressed was in perfect accord with the
                                    <hi rend="underline">declared</hi> policy <hi rend="underline"
                                    >of</hi> the two Governments <hi rend="underline">in regard
                                    to</hi> China.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>I said to him that the objections to the clause as originally drawn were
                            First, that it did not apply to the future and might be open to serious
                            criticism; and, Second, that the words “actually pursued” would
                            undoubtedly be discussed and very probably criticized both in Japan and
                            in the United States, as some Japanese might question what <pb n="449"
                                xml:id="pg_449" facs="0495"/>policy was actually being pursued by
                            the Government of the United States, and, on the other hand some
                            Americans might criticize the policy Japan was actually pursuing.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount said he understood thoroughly the objections and that he
                            would immediately cable his Government and present our views as to the

                        <p>The Viscount came to the Department this afternoon by appointment and
                            said that he was happy to state the suggested amendments in the
                            confidential protocol were entirely acceptable to his Government, and he
                            therefore concluded that the negotiation was ended successfully.</p>
                        <p>We then read over the note as drafted, after he had pointed out the
                            change of the word “a” to “the” in the last paragraph, and the making of
                            the word “agreements” to singular (agreement).<note n="24"

                            read over the protocol and agreed as to its form. He asked me as to the
                            ending of our note to him, and I replied it would be the usual form
                            which appeared in the Root note to Takahira.<note n="25"

                        <p>We also discussed the time of publication and he repeated to me that it
                            would be necessary for his Government to submit the document to Great
                            Britain on account of the treaty of alliance but that it would be a pure
                            formality. As to the protocol he thought it needless to submit it to
                            Great Britain as it was only to be used in case certain events arose and
                            would be treated as confidential by the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>We further agreed to the exchange of notes on Friday, November 2d and
                            that it would be possibly four or five days before the notes could be

                        <p>I then asked him about the publication of the notes and he said he had
                            advices from his Government saying that they would publish on the
                            morning of the 7th and that we should publish on the afternoon of the
                            6th, which would make the time the same. I told the Ambassador that I
                            should make a statement to accompany the publication and I hoped he
                            would be gratified with it.</p>
                        <p>He then read me a telegram which he had just received from Baron

                        <p>The Viscount then handed me a statement<note n="28" xml:id="d275fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> which he said would be made public in Japan at the
                            same time as the notes, in relation to naval cooperation in the Pacific.
                            The statement had been agreed upon by the Naval authorities of the two
                            Governments. I said we would follow that course also.</p>
                        <p>The Viscount then spoke of the still pending negotiation between
                            Ambassador Sato and the War Trade Board relative to the exportation of
                            steel in exchange for tonnage. I told him I would see Mr. Jones on the
                            subject and do what I could to bring the negotiation to a satisfactory
                            conclusion.</p>

                        <p>In the course of the conversations between the Japanese Special
                            Ambassador and the Secretary of State of the United States which have
                            led to the exchange of notes between them dated this day, declaring the
                            policy of the two Governments with regard to China, the question of
                            embodying the following clause in such declaration came up for
                            discussion: “they (the Governments of Japan and the United States) will
                            not take advantage of the present conditions to seek special rights or
                            privileges in China which would abridge the rights of the subjects or
                            citizens of other friendly states.”</p>
                        <p>Upon careful examination of the question, it was agreed that the clause
                            above quoted being superfluous in the relations of the two Governments
                            and liable to create erroneous impression in the minds of the public,
                            should be eliminated from the declaration.</p>

                        <p>It was, however, well understood that the principle enunciated in the
                            clause which was thus suppressed was in perfect accord with the declared
                            policy of the two Governments in regard to China.</p>

                            regard to the notes exchanged with the Special Japanese Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>After reading the memorandum I said to the Minister that I fully
                            understood the reason for his Government’s delivery of the memorandum,
                            though as a matter of fact it was unnecessary since there was no thought
                            by either Viscount Ishii or me to bind China in any way for we did not
                            possess the power or have the intention to do so. I explained to him
                            that, in order to avoid any question of China giving assent to the
                            understanding reached in the notes, I had abstained mentioning the
                            negotiations to him during their progress or advising his Government in
                            any way of the subjects being discussed. I said that I did not want
                            anyone to say that China had relinquished any right by not objecting to
                            the understanding before its conclusion although cognizant of its
                            negotiation. That my silence had been deliberate and because I wished to
                            keep China from an embarrassing situation.</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>I further told him that our traditional friendship for China was
                            unchanged and that China’s interests had been in my mind throughout my
                            intercourse with Viscount Ishii; that, while this was so, he must
                            realize that the present war had entirely changed conditions; that in
                            financing it we had need of all our money at home; and that in view of
                            this drain upon our resources China did not today offer the same
                            attractiveness for investment to American capital as it had in the past.
                            I pointed out to him that Japan and the United States were the only two
                            countries which had surplus capital to invest at the present time, but
                            that we were not anxious to send our money abroad if we had to enter
                            into competition in placing it; that the time had passed when China
                            could play off the United States against Japan in the matter of
                            investments for we were no longer keen to encourage sending money into
                            other countries when we needed it so much for carrying on the war.</p>
                        <p>I said that if we dropped out the field would be left entirely in the
                            hands of Japanese, which I presumed China would not wish; that we were
                            anxious to prove our friendship for his country by aiding her
                            financially, but that the only way to do so in the present circumstances
                            was to come to some arrangement for cooperation with Japan, as
                            competition would probably defeat any loan in this country; and I
                            assumed that China would prefer to have us participate even under those
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Minister listened intently but made no comment. He then said that his
                            Government was particularly disturbed over the recognition of Japan’s
                            “special interests” in China, and asked what the phrase meant.</p>
                        <p>I replied that it was manifestly an axiom that geographical propinquity
                            necessarily gave nations special interests in their neighbors, and that
                            setting it forth was merely stating an axiom and nothing more.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that he could not see, if it was an axiom, why it was
                            stated; that it was the statement which disturbed his Government.</p>
                        <p>I replied to him that I thought he would agree with me that to concede a
                            truth, which could not be successfully denied, in exchange for a
                            declaration of a policy which restrained the other party was certainly a
                            very desirable thing to do.</p>
                        <p>He asked to what I referred, and I said to the last clause of the notes
                            in which the United States and Japan declared themselves opposed to “any
                            government” infringing China’s independence or territorial integrity, a
                            declaration which applied to the parties to the understanding as well as
                            to other governments. I told him that such a bargain seemed to me
                            decidedly in favor of China, and I <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453"
                                facs="0499"/>believed that upon consideration his Government would
                            come to the same opinion.</p>
                        <p>The Minister wished to know if the special interests applied to other
                            neighbors such as Russia on the north, France on the south, and Great
                            Britain on the west.</p>
                        <p>I told him that the axiom held good the world over, that we had
                            recognized it in our relations on this continent, and that China might
                            apply it with equal force to her neighbors.</p>
                        <p>I said that probably the Chinese Government had done wisely as a matter
                            of precaution in sending the memorandum, but that no reservation or
                            caveat could change the natural consequence of propinquity.</p>
                        <p>The Minister thanked me for my explanations but expressed no opinions of
                            his own.</p>

                        <p>It does not seem to me satisfactory in that no time of surrendering
                            sovereignty to China is indicated and the proposed negotiation for the
                            surrender is to be based apparently on the . . . treaty of May,
                                1915,<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">

                            are other features of the statement which I do not like.</p>
                        <p>The issuance of this statement, however, puts us in a decidedly
                            advantageous position. To remain silent in the face of the statement
                            would be an admission on your part that it set forth the agreement
                            reached at Paris. If it does not state the agreement fully or
                            accurately, you are, in justice to yourself, bound to make public the
                            terms on which you assented to the Shantung articles in the treaty.
                            While there might have been ground for complaint if you had made public
                            a statement as to Japan’s promises before the Japanese Government had
                            made one, there can certainly be none now, because to do so would be to
                            admit that their statement was either inaccurate or incomplete.</p>
                        <p>We hold the strategic position and, I feel, we should use it. I would
                            suggest, therefore, that you prepare a statement of your understanding
                            of their agreement which can be published on the heels of their
                            statement when it appears in our newspapers with the assertion that you
                            find it necessary to do this in order to avoid the charge of having
                            given your assent to the treaty provisions on the basis of the
                            statements of the Japanese Government issued at Tokio.</p>
                        <p>For your information I am enclosing a copy of a draft of a declaration to
                            be made by the Japanese regarding the Shantung question <pb n="455"

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I am submitting to you
                            a memorandum upon the “Present Nature and Extent of the Monroe Doctrine
                            and Its Need of Restatement,” since the questions, with which it deals,
                            appear to me to require consideration and decision at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In all frankness I should say that my personal inclination has been
                            against expanding our traditional policy in dealing with Latin America,
                            and that I have been concerned over certain actions of this Government
                            which seemed to be beyond the purposes of that policy. I approached the
                            subject with this prejudice against any radical departure from
                            established policy, but after taking into consideration the scope of the
                            Monroe Doctrine, the present problems in Latin America, and the motives
                            which to-day inspire our conduct in the international affairs of this
                            hemisphere, I have been compelled to change my views.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the logic of the situation is irresistible, and that
                            we must modify our present declared policy.</p>
                        <p>Whether this is to be done by a wider application of the Monroe Doctrine
                            so as to include new methods of obtaining political control by European
                            powers; or whether it is to be done by announcing a new doctrine, which
                            will include the present standard of international duty, are questions
                            which I am not prepared to answer without a more careful study of the
                            subject. But that something should be done I am convinced, if this
                            Government is to avoid the charge of insincerity and inconsistency in
                            its relations with Latin America, <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460"
                                facs="0506"/>of which suggestions are already too frequent and not
                            without apparent justification.</p>
                        <p>When you have had opportunity to examine the annexed memorandum I would
                            like very much to discuss the subject with you.</p>
                        <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                                    Doctrine, and Its Need of Restatement</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The Monroe Doctrine is in substance that the United States considers
                                an extension of political control by a European power over any
                                territory in this hemisphere, not already occupied by it, to be a
                                menace to the national safety of the United States.</p>
                            <p>In 1828, when the doctrine was enunciated, the dangers of the
                                extension of European political power on this continent lay in the
                                possible occupation of unsettled regions and in the conquest of the
                                territory of an independent American state.</p>
                            <p>Later, during the Polk Administration, another danger was recognized
                                in the possibility of a voluntary cession of territory by an
                                American state to a European power, and the Monroe Doctrine was
                                shown to be broad enough to include this means of acquiring
                                political dominion.</p>
                            <p>While the primary idea of the Monroe Doctrine is opposition by the
                                United States to any extension of European control over American
                                territory or institutions, the idea is subject to the modification
                                that the control must possess the element of <hi rend="underline"
                                    >permanency</hi>.</p>
                            <p>When the hostile occupation of the territory of an American state or
                                the coercion by force of its government by a European power is
                                intended to be temporary, and is employed solely as a means to
                                compel the government of the state to meet a particular
                                international obligation, which it has wilfully neglected or refused
                                to perform, the territorial occupation or coercion would not appear
                                to be in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Nevertheless the
                                intention of temporary control must be beyond question, and any
                                indication of converting temporary control for a particular purpose
                                into permanent control for general purposes would bring the case
                                within the scope of the Doctrine and <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461"
                                    facs="0507"/>create a situation, in which the United States
                                might be compelled to intervene.</p>
                            <p>Just how far a European government should be permitted to exercise
                                control over American territory or over an American government as a
                                means of obtaining redress for an international wrong is a question
                                which must be decided in each case upon the facts. If it may be
                                reasonably presumed from the circumstances surrounding the
                                assumption of control or from the length of time it continues that
                                the intention is to make it permanent, denial of such intention by
                                the controlling power should in no way interfere with the assertion
                                by the United States of its established policy or with its
                                insistence that the European aggressor immediately withdraw from the
                                territory or surrender its control.</p>
                            <p>In dealing with the cases as they arise the two essential elements of
                                the Monroe Doctrine must be constantly borne in mind; first, that
                                the doctrine is exclusively a <hi rend="underline">national</hi>
                                policy of the United States and relates to its national safety and
                                vital interests; and second, that the European control, against
                                which it is directed, must possess the element of <hi
                                    rend="underline">permanency</hi>, or a reasonable possibility of
                                permanency.</p>
                            <p>While occupation and conquest, as means of obtaining political
                                control over American territory by a European power, are acts of
                                that power alone, voluntary cession, as a means, is the mutual act
                                of the two governments which are parties to the transfer. As a
                                consequence the inclusion of voluntary cession among the acts of
                                acquisition, against which the Monroe Doctrine is directed,
                                introduces the necessary corollary that it may be invoked against an
                                American government as well as against a European government. It is
                                manifest from this that the Monroe Doctrine is, as has been said, a
                                national policy of the United States and also that it is not a
                                Pan-American policy. The opposition to European control over
                                American territory is not primarily to preserve the integrity of any
                                American state—that may be a result but not a purpose of the
                                Doctrine. The essential idea is to prevent a condition which would
                                menace the national interests of the United States.</p>
                            <p>In case it should become necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine
                                against another American republic, which has ceded or apparently
                                intends to cede any of its territorial rights to a European power,
                                the preventive action of the United States would appear to be a
                                direct interference with the sovereign authority of the American
                                republic over its own territory. Logically such action, in case a
                                cession is made or intended, amounts to an assertion of the primacy
                                of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The primacy of one
                                nation, though possessing the superior physical might to maintain
                                it, is out of harmony with the principle of the equality of <pb
                                    n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0508"/>nations which underlies
                                Pan-Americanism, however just or altruistic the primate may be.</p>
                            <p>While, therefore, the Monroe Doctrine and Pan-Americanism may come
                                into conflict, the Monroe Doctrine will in case of conflict prevail
                                so long as the United States maintains the Doctrine and is the
                                dominant power among the American nations. The equality of American
                                republics and, in a measure, their independence are legal rather
                                than actual, but it is necessary to acknowledge their legal
                                existence, if the theory of Pan-Americanism is accepted. The Monroe
                                Doctrine, on the contrary, is founded upon no assumptions of this
                                character but upon a fact, namely, the superior power of the United
                                States to compel submission to its will whenever a condition arises
                                involving European control over American territory, which, because
                                of the permanent nature of the control, is considered to be a menace
                                to the national safety of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The Monroe Doctrine, therefore, should not be confused with
                                Pan-Americanism. It is purely a national policy of the United
                                States, while Pan-Americanism is the joint policy of the American
                                group of nations. The Pan-American policy may support and may
                                probably be considered as invariably supporting the idea of the
                                Monroe Doctrine in opposing the extension of European political
                                control over any portion of this continent. The reason, however, for
                                such support will not be the national safety of the United States,
                                but the mutual protection of American nations from European attempts
                                upon their independence. In its advocacy of the Monroe Doctrine the
                                United States considers its own interests. The integrity of other
                                American nations is an incident, not an end. While this may seem
                                based on selfishness alone, the author of the Doctrine had no higher
                                or more generous motive in its declaration. To assert for it a
                                nobler purpose is to proclaim a new doctrine.</p>
                            <p>As stated, this traditional policy, as originally declared and
                                subsequently defined, relates to European acquisition of political
                                power in America by means of occupation, conquest or cession of
                                territory. There is, nevertheless, another method by which such
                                power may be acquired, a method, which to-day can be more easily and
                                more successfully employed than those to which the Monroe Doctrine
                                has been in the past applied. It is a mode of extending political
                                power, which, in my opinion, has caused much of the confusion and
                                uncertainty as to the scope of the Monroe Doctrine because of its
                                gradual development and the failure to recognize it as in practical
                                conflict with that policy.</p>
                            <p>Within the past quarter of a century the rapid increase of wealth in
                                the United States and the great nations of Europe has caused their
                                people, in constantly increasing numbers, to seek investments in <pb
                                    n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0509"/>foreign lands. No richer
                                field has been presented than the vast undeveloped resources of the
                                republics south of the United States. Hundreds of millions of
                                dollars have been expended in these lands by the capitalists of this
                                country, Great Britain, France, Germany, and other European nations
                                in the construction of railways, the establishment of steamship
                                lines, the development of mines, the cultivation of cotton, fruits,
                                and other agricultural products, and the operation of various
                                industrial enterprises.</p>
                            <p>In the opening up of these countries and the development of their
                                resources their governments require financial aid, or seize the
                                opportunity to replenish their treasuries. Eager investors,
                                appreciating the natural riches of these regions and the
                                possibilities of reward to those who obtain the right to exploit
                                them, lend their money readily in exchange for special privileges,
                                concessions and large rates of interest.</p>
                            <p>The governments of many of these republics, impoverished and
                                improvident and frequently in the hands of unscrupulous and greedy
                                men, careless of the future and heedless of their country’s welfare,
                                borrow beyond the limit of their capacity to repay, hypothecating
                                every possible source of national revenue for years to come. As a
                                result some of the smaller American republics, ruled by military
                                dictators or oligarchies, who have enriched themselves at the
                                expense of their countries, have become hopelessly bankrupt. In some
                                cases the United States, in others a European power, is the chief
                                creditor, to whose favor the insolvent nation must look for the
                                means to continue its political existence.</p>
                            <p>With the present industrial activity, the scramble for markets, and
                                the incessant search for new opportunities to produce wealth,
                                commercial expansion and success are closely interwoven with
                                political domination over the territory which is being
                                exploited.</p>
                            <p>The European power, whose subjects supply the capital to install and
                                operate the principal industries of a small American republic and
                                furnish the funds upon which its government is dependent, may, if it
                                so wishes, dominate the political action of the American government.
                                To state it in another way, a European power whose subjects own the
                                public debt of an American state and have invested there large
                                amounts of capital, may control the government of the state as
                                completely as if it had acquired sovereign rights over the territory
                                through occupation, conquest or cession.</p>
                            <p>The question, which is unavoidable, but which can only be answered
                                after mature thought for it is pregnant with difficulties and with
                                seeming departures from the time-honored policy of the United
                                States, is this—</p>
                            <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0510"/>
                            <p>When by reason of commercial and financial domination a European
                                power becomes undoubted master of the political conduct of an
                                American republic, is a condition presented which may justify the
                                United States in applying to it the Monroe Doctrine with the same
                                vigor, with which it would have applied the Doctrine if the European
                                power had by force or treaty established a protectorate over the
                                American republic?</p>
                            <p>If the conditions are compared, it is evident that in both cases a
                                European nation has extended political control over American
                                territory; and in both cases the element of permanency is present.
                                They are to all intents identical in their results, though they
                                differ in the means by which the results were obtained.</p>
                            <p>The United States would certainly oppose the surrender by an American
                                republic of all or a portion of its sovereignty to one of the great
                                powers of Europe. It would be a voluntary and peaceable act of the
                                republic, but it would be manifestly contrary to the Monroe
                                Doctrine. If voluntarily and peaceably an American republic becomes
                                so financially dependent upon a European power that the latter
                                controls the government of the former, is not that also contrary to
                                the Monroe Doctrine? Is not one case as great a menace to the
                                national safety of the United States as the other? If there is a
                                practical distinction between the two cases, what is that
                                distinction? If there is no practical distinction, why should the
                                Monroe Doctrine not be applied to both?</p>
                            <p>These questions suggest the following:</p>
                            <p>Has the time arrived, as a result of modern economic conditions in
                                Central and South America, when the Monroe Doctrine, if it is to
                                continue effective, should be restated so as to include European
                                acquisition of political control through the agency of financial
                                supremacy over an American republic?</p>
                            <p>If a more radical change of policy than the one suggested by the
                                foregoing query seems necessary and advisable under present
                                conditions the question to be answered may be stated thus:</p>
                            <p>Should a new doctrine be formulated declaring that the United States
                                is opposed to the extension of European control over American
                                territory and institutions through financial as well as other means,
                                and having for its object, not only the national safety and
                                interests of this country, but also the establishment and
                                maintenance of republican constitutional government in all American
                                states, the free exercise by their people of their public and
                                private rights, the administration of impartial justice, and the
                                prevention of political authority from becoming the tool of personal
                                ambition and greed, the chief enemies of liberal institutions, of
                                economic development, and of domestic peace?</p>
                            <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0511"/>
                            <p>Stated in a more general way the question is this:</p>
                            <p>Do not the modern ideals and aims of government in the United States
                                require us to abandon the purely selfish principle, which has so
                                long controlled our policies in dealing with other American nations,
                                and to adopt more altruistic and humanitarian principles, which will
                                be in harmony with the sense of fraternal responsibility, which is
                                increasingly dominant in all our international relations?</p>
                            <p>In the presentation of these questions there is no intention to
                                advocate a particular policy in dealing with the international
                                affairs of the Western Hemisphere. They are submitted solely for the
                                purpose of suggesting possible changes in the Monroe Doctrine,
                                either conservative or radical, which will be more in accord with
                                modern ideals and conditions. It appears to me to be necessary, in
                                order to avoid confusion and contradiction in the future conduct of
                                affairs of the Department, to determine definitely whether the
                                Monroe Doctrine should remain unchanged, should be restated, or
                                should be superseded. Uncertainty as to the policy, which this
                                Government intends to pursue, will undoubtedly cause embarrassment
                                when special cases are presented for action. The subject, in my
                                judgment, should receive prompt and careful consideration.</p>

                        <p>Since receiving the communication I have talked with him and explained to
                            him that it is impossible to grant the first request for a partnership

                            Doctrine and would open the door to all sorts of requests.</p>
                        <p>I told him that the Germans had already expressed a desire for a similar
                            arrangement on the ground of their preponderating influence in business

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I enclose a memorandum
                            covering the subject of the Monroe Doctrine, its application, and the
                            possible extension of the principle in a way to constitute a policy
                            which may be termed a “Carribean Policy”, since it is limited in
                            application to the territory in and about the Carribean Sea.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, the memorandum is this:</p>
                        <p>The Monroe Doctrine is based on the theory that any extension by a
                            European power of political control, beyond that which exists over any
                            territory in this hemisphere, is a menace to the national safety of the
                            United States. The means of extending political control, thus far
                            recognized, has been by occupation of unattached territory, by conquest
                            and by cession.</p>
                        <p>Recently the financing of revolutions and corruption of governments of
                            the smaller republics by European capitalists have frequently thrown the
                            control of these governments into the hands of a European power.</p>
                        <p>To avoid this danger of European political control by this means which
                            may be as great a menace to the national safety of this country <pb
                                n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0513"/>as occupation or cession, the
                            only method seems to be to establish a stable and honest government and
                            to prevent the revenues of the republic from becoming the prize of
                            revolution and of the foreigners who finance it.</p>
                        <p>Stability and honesty of government depend on sufficient force to resist
                            revolutions and on sufficient control over the revenues and over the
                            development of the resources to prevent official graft and dishonest
                            grants of privileges.</p>
                        <p>The possession of the Panama Canal and its defense have in a measure
                            given to the territories in and about the Carribean Sea a new importance
                            from the standpoint of our national safety. It is vital to the interests
                            of this country that European political domination should in no way be
                            extended over these regions. As it happens within this area lie the
                            small republics of America which have been and to an extent still are
                            the prey of revolutionists, of corrupt governments, and of predatory
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Because of this state of affairs our national safety, in my opinion,
                            requires that the United States should intervene and aid in the
                            establishment and maintenance of a stable and honest government, if no
                            other way seems possible to attain that end.</p>
                        <p>I make no argument on the ground of the benefit which would result to the
                            peoples of these republics by the adoption of this policy. That they
                            would be the chief beneficiaries in that their public and private rights
                            would be respected, and their prosperity and intellectual development
                            insured, is manifest. Nevertheless the argument based on humanitarian
                            purpose does not appeal to me, even though it might be justly urged,
                            because too many international crimes have been committed in the name of
                            Humanity.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the ground of national safety, the conservation of
                            national interests, is the one which should be advanced in support of
                            this policy. It is reasonable, practical, and in full accord with the
                            principle of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>In considering this policy it should be borne in mind what has been done
                            already in Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Haiti,
                            and what may have to be done in the small neighboring republics. The
                            Danish West Indies and the colonial possessions of other European
                            nations in the Carribean should not be forgotten in considering this
                            policy as through a change of their sovereignty they might become a
                            serious menace to the interests of the United States.</p>

                            <p>This is not perhaps attempted openly at first but the result is the
                                same though more subtly attained. In a large proportion of the
                                instances to which the United States has felt called upon to apply
                                the Monroe Doctrine the acts complained of have been direct
                                political acts of a European Government, as, for example, the
                                invasion of Mexico by France during the Civil War; British
                                interposition in the boundary question of Venezuela; the offer of
                                Italy to purchase the Island of St. Bartholomew in 1870; the
                                attempts of Spain to reannex Santo Domingo and other former Spanish
                                possessions in America. There have however been some instances of
                                interference for the purpose of satisfying claims of foreign
                                subjects, as, for example, the French claims based on Mexican bonds;
                                and Spanish claims against Mexico of various sorts; and the French,
                                German, British and Italian claims, including claims based on war
                                damage and on Government contracts, but it does not appear that the
                                United States protested against drastic action by these Governments
                                on the ground of the Monroe doctrine, but, on the contrary, used its
                                good offices to effect an amicable settlement. As a protest against
                                the forcible collection of contract debts, Drago advanced the
                                doctrine bearing his name. Now it is to political action growing out
                                of investments in the Carribean countries that I make particular
                                reference. The purchase of Government securities upon which payments
                                of interest and sinking funds are defaulted, and the development of
                                a concession, perhaps obtained in return for financing a revolution,
                                which is infringed or annulled, open the offending Government to
                                claims to the foreign bond holders or concessionaires who enlist the
                                aid of their Governments.</p>
                            <p>Thus the European power, whose subjects supply the capital to install
                                and operate the principal industries of a small American republic
                                and furnish the funds upon which its government is dependent, may,
                                if it finds it expedient to do so, dominate the political action of
                                the weak and bankrupt government. To state it in another way, a
                                European power whose subjects own the public debt of an American
                                state and have invested large amounts of capital, would be able to
                                control the government of the state almost as completely as if it
                                had acquired sovereign rights over the territory through occupation,
                                conquest or cession.</p>
                            <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0515"/>
                            <p>The method of obtaining political mastery by means of financial
                                control has been an increasing menace to the independence of the
                                republics situated in or about the Carribean Sea. Revolutions have
                                been frequent, due in the majority of cases to the desire of a
                                factional leader by becoming master of the nation’s revenues to
                                amass wealth for himself and his immediate friends. A revolutionary
                                chief finds little difficulty in financing his venture among foreign
                                speculators in exchange for concessions or other privileges and the
                                chance of large profits which will be theirs if the revolution is
                                successful. As a result the people of these countries are the
                                victims of constant strife between rival leaders, and their
                                condition is little improved by the governments, which exist only a
                                short time and which are used to enrich their rulers and those who
                                have financed them.</p>
                            <p>The corrupt character of the rulers, and the powerful influence of
                                foreign financiers who have aided the rulers in obtaining and will
                                aid them in maintaining control, tends toward instability of
                                Government in these same republics and not only threaten their
                                national independence but prevents the people from developing
                                intellectually or from attaining any degree of prosperity.</p>
                            <p>The United States in any circumstances would be desirous as a friend
                                of an American republic, which is suffering from this state of
                                affairs, to aid it in removing the cause. But in the case of the
                                Carribean republics self-interest as well as friendship appeals.
                                Since the construction of the Panama Canal it is essential for its
                                safety that the neighboring nations should not come under the
                                political domination of any European power either directly by force
                                or by cession or indirectly through the agency of financial control
                                by its subjects. While force and cession are not impossible means if
                                the government of a republic is corrupt or weak, the greater danger
                                lies in the subtlety of financial control.</p>
                            <p>To meet this danger the surest if not the only means, is the
                                establishment of a stable and honest government which will devote
                                the revenues of the state to defraying its just obligations, to
                                developing its resources, and to educating its people, and which
                                will protect individuals in their rights of life, liberty and
                                property, and in the enjoyment of their political rights.</p>
                            <p>In order to accomplish this the first thing to be done is to remove
                                the prize of revolution, namely, the control of the public revenues.
                                If this can be done there will be few revolutions about the
                                Carribean. In the second place the government must not be dependent
                                on foreign financiers for its continuance in power. In the third
                                place it must <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0516"/>possess a
                                reliable and efficient military force sufficient to suppress
                                insurrection against the established authority.</p>
                            <p>If there could arise in all the Carribean republics men of strong
                                character, patriotic and honest, as there have in some, who are able
                                to carry out such a policy, it would be well for all concerned.
                                Unfortunately this is not the case, and the United States is of
                                necessity forced to choose between permitting these republics to
                                continue to be the prey of unscrupulous adventurers native and
                                foreign, or to undertake the task of aiding in the establishment of
                                a stable and honest government, upon principles which will insure
                                political independence and prevent any possibility of European
                                control.</p>
                            <p>It would seem, therefore, that in the case of the republics about the
                                Carribean Sea the United States should expand the application of the
                                Monroe Doctrine, and declare as a definite Carribean policy that,
                                while it does not seek dominion over the territory of any of these
                                republics, it is necessary for the national safety of the United
                                States, and particularly in view of its interests on the Isthmus of
                                Panama, that it aid the people of those republics in establishing
                                and maintaining responsible and honest governments to such extent as
                                may be necessary in each particular case, and that it will not
                                tolerate control over or interference with the political or
                                financial affairs of these republics by any European power or its
                                nationals or permit the occupation, even temporarily, by a European
                                power, of any territory of such republics.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Brazilian
                            Government has reported in favor of your proposition excepting the
                            matter of arbitration upon which it is still deliberating.</p>
                        <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0520"/>
                        <p>Argentine has reported enthusiastically in favor of all the
                            propositions.</p>
                        <p>We have not yet heard from Chile. You remember it was the Chilean
                            Ambassador who expressed the most objection both to the arbitration
                            feature—that is compelling the arbitration of differences within a
                            certain time—also to the guarantee of republican form of Government and
                            the guarantee of integrity.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador is quite anxious that we shall proceed with the
                            treaty among the republics of the western hemisphere in order to produce
                            an effect upon the European belligerents.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Brazilian Ambassador today to request the Chilean Ambassador
                            to urge his Government to give us its opinion with a view of proceeding
                            as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador thought it might be well to have the plan
                            presented to the other representatives soon so that they could consult
                            their Governments. My own opinion is that the small countries will be
                            very glad to approve and accept the plan <hi rend="italic">in
                            toto</hi>.</p>
                        <p>There are two questions:<list>
                                <item>First: How long should we wait on Chile?</item>
                                <item>Second: What we shall do if Chile postpones answer or answers
                                    unfavorably to some of the important parts of the plan.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Would the objection of one of the larger countries compel an abandonment
                            of the plan, or would you want it presented to the others?</p>
                        <p>I think the treaty should be so drawn that those that do not sign now
                            would be permitted to sign at any future time. If some of the countries
                            are willing to accept the main propositions but are not willing to
                            accept one or more of the minor provisions would it be best to so frame
                            the treaty that each would bind itself to the others to such an extent
                            as it is willing? I think this would be better than allowing the
                            opposition of a few on some details [to] prevent the securing of such
                            advantages as might come from agreement of all the nations on some of
                            the provisions and of some of the nations on all the provisions.</p>
                        <p>I have referred to a number of questions which have arisen in the
                            discussion of the subject with the three Ambassadors, but the most
                            important thing to find out is whether we should wait on Chile before
                            submitting the plan to the other countries. In submitting it we need not
                            say that any of the nations have been consulted but send identical notes
                            to all of them at the same time, submitting the plan as you have
                            prepared it.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: This is very good news
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>I think that we need not wait for Chile’s reply after we have got the
                            full assent of Brazil and Argentina; but I think we should have the
                            cordial support of those two governments before laying the plan before
                            the other governments. I am assuming that Brazil already knows that we
                            are quite willing to entertain and discuss any modification of the
                            arbitration clause that she may wish to suggest, provided we can be
                            assured of the acceptance of the principle.</p>
                        <p>So soon as that is accomplished it is my idea that we should lay the plan
                            before all the other governments (except, of course, Mexico) at one and
                            the same time in identical notes, and that it would be well at that time
                            to state to their representatives, unofficially and confidentially, that
                            Brazil and Argentina had assented (and Chile, if by that time she had),
                            for that would constitute a most influential argument for its universal
                            acceptance.</p>
                        <p>I agree with you that it would be wise to draw and conclude the treaty in
                            such a way that those not accepting it now would have an opportunity to
                            accept and ratify it at any future time. But it is my present judgment
                            that it would not be wise to let some enter upon other terms than the
                            rest. I think the understanding should be the same for all who come in,
                            otherwise some very confused responsibilities might arise. With several
                            of the big States in and a number of the smaller ones, we could await
                            the outcome with confidence.</p>
                        <p>With very happy expectations in this great matter,</p>

                            a despatch just received from Santiago.<note n="4" xml:id="d291fn1">Not

                            afternoon that he had received an answer from his Government which he
                            would be able to submit Monday. He said that it was in the nature of a
                                <hi rend="underline">counter proposition</hi> and I think eliminates
                                <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0522"/>the guaranty of territorial
                            integrity and the guaranty of republican government.</p>
                        <p>He also said that he understood from Mr. House that <hi rend="underline"
                                >the plan would not be presented to the other countries unless it
                                had the approval of the three large countries</hi>—Brazil, Argentine
                            and Chile to whom Mr. House confided the plan. The Chilean Ambassador
                            also gathered the idea that the chief purpose was to have the South
                            American countries join in the Monroe Doctrine and he did not seem
                            favorably inclined to the idea of protecting each South American country
                            against other South American countries.</p>
                        <p>The flimsy presents Chile’s proposals in regard to the settlement of
                            disputes between Chile and Peru. I wonder if it would not be well to
                            take up this subject with Peru and see if any progress can be made
                            toward settlement.</p>

                        <p>Will you not be kind enough to have a talk with Ambassador Naón and
                            ascertain whether he got the impression from House that the Chilean
                            Ambassador seems to have got, that we would not propose our treaty to
                            the other countries of South and Central America unless all three of the
                            A. B. C. approved. I remember nothing of the kind, and think Mr. Suárez

                        <p>I think it would be wise, as you suggest, to approach the Peruvian

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am sending you copy
                            of the communication which we have received from the Chilean
                                Ambassador;<note n="6" xml:id="d293fn1">Not printed.</note> and I
                            will call your attention to it proposition by proposition.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0523"/>
                        <p>In the first place—you will notice that in the paragraph marked “1” he
                            does not expect the matter to be proposed to the other governments
                            unless it is approved by the three to whom it was first
                            submitted—Brazil, Argentina and Chile.</p>
                        <p>I think it would be well for us to correct this impression and say to him
                            that while we feel that it was wise to submit it to the three larger
                            countries before submitting it to the others, we would not feel
                            justified in refusing to enter into an agreement with such nations as
                            would desire to become parties to such an agreement, merely because one
                            or more of the nations did not see fit to join, and that we feel sure
                            that no nation which for any reason feels that it cannot come in would
                            desire to deny to the other nations such benefits as might result from
                            the negotiation of such a treaty.</p>
                        <p>Second: You will notice that he objects—(and his Government supports his
                            objection)—to a guarantee of a republican form of government.</p>
                        <p>There is force in the objection which he makes—namely, that the form of
                            Government is a matter for the people of the country and not a matter in
                            which outside countries should interfere. At the same time, as all these
                            governments are republican in form and as none of them have any
                            intention of returning to any other form I do not believe that the
                            objection which he makes would be entertained by other countries and it
                            would be a great advantage to have this endorsement given to the
                            republican idea of government; and, moreover, we might have difficulty
                            in securing the ratification of a treaty which pledged us to assist in
                            maintaining the independence of a monarchy.</p>
                        <p>We might meet his objection, it occurs to me, by saying that the treaty
                            will doubtless provide for its denunciation by any of the contracting
                            parties upon notice—which is generally one year—so that any country
                            desiring to change its form of government can give notice of its desire
                            and withdraw, and when released from the treaty can then make such
                            change in its form of government as it desires.</p>
                        <p>Third: The question which he raises about the guarantee of territorial
                            integrity is more difficult to deal with, and yet I think it is even
                            more important than the guarantee of a republican form of
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the treaty is to insure peace in the western hemisphere
                            and nothing will go further in this direction than a guarantee of
                            territorial integrity. While we are confident as to our own intentions,
                            it will be a very acceptable thing to Latin-America to have us agree
                            that we will respect the territorial integrity of all the other nations,
                            and it will be a great protection to the little countries to have their
                            territorial integrity guaranteed.</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0524"/>
                        <p>The thing that troubles Chile, of course, is the controversy between
                            Chile and Peru and I suggest that we might meet this proposition as
                            follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Let those nations sign which will agree to sign and let the guarantee
                                cover all questions that may arise <hi rend="underline">after</hi>
                                the settlement of existing disputes or disagreements, each nation to
                                set forth specifically the excepted dispute.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>This will enable Chile to sign and in doing so make an exception of the
                            dispute with Peru. Peru may or may not desire to make an exception of
                            the dispute with Chile. If we make a guarantee covering all future
                            disputes I do not think it will be necessary to go further than have the
                            nations agree to use their best endeavors to reach a settlement of any
                            disputes which may exist, without fixing a time limit on those
                            disputes.</p>
                        <p>If Peru is guaranteed against any further invasion of its territory I
                            believe it will be possible for the Peruvian government to accept the
                            settlement offered by Chile, which is that the control of the disputed
                            territory be submitted to an election within a year, no one being
                            permitted to vote who is not a resident at the time the agreement is
                            made; the nation securing the disputed territory to pay a fixed sum to
                            the nation losing. The sum of ten millions is proposed, but Chile has
                            indicated a willingness to go beyond that. If Peru can be assured of
                            territorial integrity after the settlement of this dispute it is more
                            than likely that a settlement can be soon effected.</p>
                        <p>While it would be desirable to have a time limit fixed for the settlement
                            of existing disputes that is not so essential as the agreement that when
                            the disputes are settled there shall be no more forcible taking of
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>I believe that nearly all the countries would enter into such a treaty
                            and it should be left open for others to sign afterwards.</p>
                        <p>You will notice that the Chilean Ambassador makes a distinction between
                            original boundaries and disputes of territory arising from other
                            sources. I see no insuperable objection to that distinction, but believe
                            it would be better to let it rest with an agreement on the part of the
                            nations to try and adjust their disputes. Possibly we might make the
                            provision for arbitration as to original boundaries, and then add the
                            promise as to other boundary disputes.</p>
                        <p>Fourth: You will notice that the objection he makes in regard to the
                            provision of monopoly of arms. I do not think his objection is sound but
                            as the purpose of this paragraph is to prevent the shipping of arms from
                            one American country into another it might be sufficient if the
                            agreement provided for legislation which would enable each country to so
                            control the export of arms as not to permit export of arms to be used by
                            one of the contracting parties as against another. <pb n="479"
                                xml:id="pg_479" facs="0525"/>The Chilean Ambassador is afraid that
                            we might have difficulty in securing the ratification of the treaty if
                            it provided for a radical change in this respect, and he does not want
                            to have the treaty fail on account of a provision which would incite
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>I might add, in closing, that the Argentine Ambassador is in favor of the

                            desirous of that form, with the exception of the question of arbitration
                            of differences, and upon this they have not yet given their final

                        <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs has made confidential inquiry of me as to
                            what would be the attitude of the United States towards Uruguay’s
                            associating herself with the A. B. C. combination. Uruguayan Government
                            while assuming that the A. B. C. in its present form is countenanced and
                            inspired by the United States desires to act in harmony with the wishes
                            of the United States in this matter. If A. B. C. is inspired in desire
                            to work with United States in development of common Pan-American policy
                            Uruguay believes such policy should be directed on the basis of equality
                            of American states <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0526"/>fitted to
                            participate and would wish to enter. If A. B. C. contemplates acting as
                            counterpoise to influence of the United States or has in view only the
                            immediate interests of the constituent powers Uruguay would continue to
                            pursue its entirely independent policy in cooperation with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In view of the forthcoming visit of Brazilian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs here and his meeting with Argentine and Chile Foreign Ministers
                            at Buenos Aires next month Uruguayan Government considers its situation
                            somewhat difficult. I am reliably informed that Argentine Minister here
                            has informally sounded Minister for Foreign Affairs as to whether he
                            would desire to go to Buenos Aires for the meeting. If the United States
                            approves Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs would probably attend
                            meeting and give his Government’s adherence to A. B. C. Expression of
                            our attitude is desired in order to enable Uruguayan Government more
                            intelligently to shape its policy before the beginning of May.</p>
                        <p>Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs will be met at the frontier by the
                            President of Uruguay and Minister for Foreign Affairs about May 7th. He
                            will remain in Uruguay until May 18th and go from here to Buenos Aires
                            and Santiago returning to Buenos Aires with Chilean Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs for meeting of the three Ministers. Original occasion of visit
                            of Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Uruguayan boundary is
                            celebration of completed delimitation of the line and out of this grew
                            extension of itinerary.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> and I suggest the substance of
                            an answer as follows:</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that we cannot undertake to decide even by suggestion who
                            are to be included in the agreement proposed between the A. B. C.
                            countries, although I see no objection to our confidentially calling
                            Naón’s attention to the fact that this inquiry was made.</p>
                        <p>We could answer Uruguay first, that we have no objection whatever to the
                            agreement including as many countries as desire to enter into it and
                            that, if invited to join, Uruguay need not hesitate out of any fear that
                            the proposed agreement is in any way hostile or unfriendly to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Our understanding of the proposition is that these countries are to adopt
                            among themselves the same form of treaty that we have <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0527"/>adopted as between this nation and some
                            thirty others. This will leave the A. B. C. powers to decide whether
                            they desire to include any others and will leave Uruguay free to accept
                            if invited.</p>
                        <p>I might unofficially call the Uruguay Minister’s attention to the fact
                            that if there is any objection at all to the inclusion of Uruguay it
                            will probably be on the ground of setting a precedent—that is, if
                            Uruguay is included because that country joins Argentina and Brazil, the
                            same argument would include Bolivia, which joins Chile as well as
                            Argentina and Brazil; and Paraguay, which joins the same countries that
                            Uruguay does.</p>
                        <p>In all of this there is gratifying evidence of the success of the plan
                            which you have in mind—of bringing all of the countries together in some
                            satisfactory agreement.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I have laid before the
                            President your counter-proposition and at his request present the
                            situation as he views it.</p>
                        <p>First: He has communicated with Mr. House and finds that Mr. House did
                            not intend to convey the impression that the presentation of this plan
                            to the republics of Latin-America would depend upon its acceptance by
                            any one or more countries. The misunderstanding on this subject probably
                            arose from the suggestion made by him to the effect that, if approved by
                            the three countries to which he presented it, these three countries
                            might assist in presenting it to the other countries.</p>
                        <p>The President would not feel justified in making the negotiation of a
                            treaty so important to all the countries dependent upon the action of
                            any one country—action that might be controlled entirely by
                            circumstances which, while they might justify the decision of that
                            country not to enter into the agreement, might not affect other
                            countries. And, besides, it would be unfair to any country to assume
                            that it would be willing to stand in the way of the negotiation of such
                            a treaty merely because it, for any reason, was not able to join in the
                            convention.</p>
                        <p>Second: The President feels that the agreement will be greatly
                            strengthened by the guarantee of a republican form of government and he
                            doubts whether it would be possible to secure the ratification of the
                            treaty by the Senate if this guarantee were omitted.</p>
                        <p>While it is true, as you suggest, that the form of government is, in the
                            first instance, a matter to be decided by the people of the country,
                            still, in view of the fact that all of these countries have adopted the
                            republican form of government, and in view of the further fact that the
                            trend of the world is toward the idea of popular government, it would
                            seem that the right of return to monarchy is one that need not be
                            considered. It is not likely that officials of any government would be
                            willing to create uneasiness in the minds of the people of that country
                            by any action which would even suggest the possibility of an abandonment
                            of the government’s representative character.</p>
                        <p>Third: The President feels that the guaranty of territorial integrity is
                            an essential part of the plan and that it would be unwise to eliminate
                            it.</p>
                        <p>History has shown that nearly all wars have resulted in changing the
                            territorial boundaries of the nations engaged—in fact, many <pb n="483"
                                xml:id="pg_483" facs="0529"/>wars have had such changes as their
                            object. Nothing would go further to insure peace among the nations of
                            the western hemisphere than an understanding that force would not be
                            recognized as a legitimate means of acquiring territory.</p>
                        <p>The United States is not only willing to give assurances of its purpose
                            in this respect, but is willing, if desired, to join with the
                            Latin-American republics in giving specific and definite assurances that
                            no contracting state will be forced to part with any of its
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>Fourth: It is necessary, of course, to recognize the fact that there are
                            existing disputes in regard to territory and boundaries which have to be
                            taken into consideration, and the plan you propose of distinguishing
                            between disputes over original boundaries and boundary disputes arising
                            from other sources may point to a solution. The guaranty of territorial
                            integrity might, for instance, read something like this:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote"><p>“One: All territorial boundaries now agreed upon
                                shall remain unchanged, and their establishment shall be guaranteed
                                by the contracting parties.</p>
                            <p>“Two: All disputes as to <hi rend="underline">original</hi>
                                boundaries shall be determined in accordance with the plan set forth
                                in the proposition submitted by the President, such disputed
                                boundaries to be set forth specifically by the nations
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>“Three: Territorial disputes which have arisen from <hi
                                    rend="underline">any other cause</hi> than disputes over
                                original boundaries shall be specifically stated by the parties
                                interested, and shall be adjusted as soon as circumstances will
                                permit; the parties to the dispute pledging them-selves to put forth
                                their best efforts to secure an early adjustment of these disputes,
                                all boundaries, when finally determined, to be accepted in like
                                manner as those already established, and to be for the future
                                guaranteed.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>You will notice that the plan above outlined guarantees the permanence of
                            the boundaries <hi rend="underline">now agreed upon,</hi> provides for
                            an early settlement of disputes over <hi rend="underline">original</hi>
                            boundaries and relieves from, embarrassment those nations which have
                            territorial disputes that raise from other causes.</p>
                        <p>The provisions relating to existing disputes have not been submitted to
                            Brazil or Argentina but are suggested to you tentatively by way of
                            indicating what we would be quite willing to discuss if, in that form,
                            they commend themselves to your Government.</p>
                        <p>As to the matter of arms we do not anticipate any difficulty in securing
                            the ratification of a treaty pledging the contracting governments to an
                            endeavor to secure legislation which will enable each government to
                            prevent the export of arms intended for use by one of the contracting
                            parties against another of the contracting parties. <pb n="484"
                                xml:id="pg_484" facs="0530"/>Your government has, within the last
                            few months, given evidence of its adherence to this policy.</p>
                        <p>The provision above referred to, guaranteeing territorial integrity and
                            national independence would, of course, be a protection to the
                            contracting parties against foreign powers, as well as against each
                            other.</p>
                        <p>While the United States has, for a century, borne alone the
                            responsibility involved in preventing aggression from countries in the
                            eastern hemisphere, and while the purpose of this Government in
                            proposing this treaty is not to secure relief from these
                            responsibilities, still it will be gratifying to this country to have
                            the republics of Latin-America join in the upholding of what is known as
                            the Monroe Doctrine, because such a recognition of the doctrine by them
                            would prevent for the future any misunderstanding of its purpose and any
                            underestimating of its value.</p>
                        <p>I have not mentioned the provision for embodying in the proposed treaty
                            the principles of the treaties already negotiated, providing for
                            investigation of all disputes. This we regard as of great value. The
                            three countries so far interviewed agree to this and we have no doubt
                            that all the rest will accept it.</p>
                        <p>The President hopes that your Government will, upon full consideration of
                            the subject, find it possible to join in this treaty at this time. It
                            will be a matter of sincere regret if existing conditions should compel
                            your Government to postpone cooperation, but if, unhappily, such a
                            course should be deemed advisable, the friendly relations existing
                            between the United States and Chile, so firmly established and so
                            frequently manifested, will prevent misinterpretation. Provision can be
                            made in the treaty for the subsequent signing by such governments as do
                            not become parties to the convention now.</p>

                            made to the <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0531"/>Monroe Doctrine.
                            The second paragraph, while not very clear, indicates that they do not
                            think it wise to have a time set for the arbitration of existing
                            disputes. In view of Chile’s objection to this and Brazil’s attitude on
                            the subject, why would it not be well to modify the arbitration section
                            to read something as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“All boundaries now agreed upon are guaranteed for the future; all
                                differences now existing as to boundaries will be specifically set
                                forth in the treaty according to the views of the parties interested
                                and the boundaries, when fixed, will be thereafter guaranteed. The
                                parties will endeavor, according to their several interests, to
                                reach an early settlement of existing disputes; all disputes arising
                                in the future to be submitted to arbitration, provided those
                                disputes do not affect the constitutions of the respective
                                countries.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Do you think that some such wording would answer for the statement of the
                            proposition? As this treaty is to be agreed to by the nations entering
                            into it, it is entirely possible that in the exchange of views it may be
                            necessary to accept some change in the wording.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum does not mention the guaranty of republican form of
                            government. I have asked Ambassador da Gama to say to his Government
                            that the guaranty of a republican form of government having been
                            formerly endorsed by Brazil, and not being mentioned in this memorandum,
                            we assume that the former endorsement still stands.</p>
                        <p>Now that we have Brazil’s answer do you not think it would be wise to
                            communicate this plan confidentially to the representatives of the other
                            Latin-American countries so that they can be securing the opinions of
                            their respective governments? The sooner we can get this before the
                            public the better, for the influence it may have across the Atlantic. I
                            am not sure but it might be well to give it to the public at the time we
                            present it, as was done when we announced the peace plan which provides
                            for investigation in all cases. I shall be pleased to have your
                            instructions in this matter.</p>

                                the President’s plan. Minister for Foreign Affairs is ready to open
                                negotiations with me with that end in view. I have read the
                                telegrams exchanged between the Foreign Office and Suárez on the
                                subject and the Minister has offered to place all the papers in my
                                hands. Would the President and the Department like to have me
                                proceed with the negotiations here?</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Sometime early in January
                            of this year the President requested me to see the Ambassadors of the A.
                            B. C. Powers and ascertain from them whether or not they would be
                            willing to join the United States in a convention which would guarantee
                            the political and territorial integrity of the North, Central and South
                            American Republics under republican forms of government.</p>
                        <p>Also if they would be willing to agree that all manufacture of munitions
                            of war should be owned by the governments of the respective
                            countries.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0533"/>
                        <p>The President wrote these two articles himself and I took them first to
                            the Argentine Ambassador whom we thought would perhaps be most
                            sympathetic. The Ambassador received the proposal cordially, after I had
                            outlined to him just what the President had in mind. I called his
                            attention to the fact that there was a military party in the United
                            States just as there was in other countries, and after President Wilson
                            relinquished office, there was a possibility of a military policy being
                            adopted. I said if this happened it was quite probable that instead of
                            following the path laid down by President Wilson there might be a
                            sentiment for expansion. I told him there was sure to be a large part of
                            the people who would want to try out the military and naval machine. If
                            this should happen, no one could tell the final outcome.</p>
                        <p>I told him, too, that the President thought the time had come when this
                            nation should cease to assume a guardianship over its sister republics
                            and to ask them to come into partnership. I explained it was the
                            President’s intention to approach the A. B. C. Powers first and later to
                            approach the smaller republics, either directly or through the A. B.
                            C.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was very much in favor of permitting the A. B. C. Powers
                            [to] deal with the smaller republics, and it was tacitly agreed that
                            this should be done. He spoke of writing to his government in regard to
                            the proposal, to which I objected and asked him to cable it so we might
                            hear in a few days.</p>
                        <p>He was filled with enthusiasm and declared that the proposal was almost
                            epoch making, and that he was sure it would be cordially received by his
                            people. He doubted, however, whether Chile would be agreeable because of
                            her territorial aspirations. . . .</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador begged me to give him the original draft which the
                            President had written, saying he believed it would be an historic
                            document of enormous interest. I gave it to him and he wrote with his
                            own hand a copy for me to use with the other Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>I had a similar reception by the Brazilian Ambassador, and I gave him
                            practically the same argument. The discussion followed largely along the
                            lines I have mentioned with Naón.</p>
                        <p>The Chilian Ambassador was somewhat less receptive and showed a
                            disposition to delay. He brought up at once the question of their
                            boundary conflict with Peru—a subject about which I had informed myself
                            in advance so as to be able to discuss the matter with intelligence.</p>
                        <p>I told him the President had in mind that there should be an article in
                            the convention which would permit a reasonable time for the settlement
                            of such disputes and a mode of procedure. This seemed to satisfy
                            him.</p>
                        <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>All three ambassadors promised an answer within a few days. The one came
                            first from Argentine and was entirely favorable. Then Brazil was heard
                            from to the same effect. Chile, later gave an equivocal consent. This
                            was a few days before my departure for Europe, and the President
                            requested me to acquaint Mr. Bryan with what had been done and ask him
                            to carry it to a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bryan was receptive, but suggested that his peace treaties should be
                            also concluded between them. He wanted to know if there was any
                            objection to this. The President said there was not.</p>
                        <p>I heard nothing from the matter while abroad until sometime in April when
                            the President cabled me that the Chilian Ambassador had said he was
                            under the impression that I had agreed in my conversation with him that
                            the covenant should not be binding unless all of the A. B. C. Powers
                            concurred. I cabled the President that there was no such understanding,
                            and that probably the Ambassador had in mind the tacit consent that the
                            smaller republics should be approached by the A. B. C. powers rather
                            than by us directly.</p>
                        <p>This, Mr. Secretary, is a record of what occurred through me. I do not
                            know what Mr. Bryan did.</p>
                        <p>Of course you understand that the President’s purpose is to broaden the
                            Monroe Doctrine so that it may be upheld by all the American Republics
                            instead of by the United States alone as now.</p>

                            yesterday I took up the matter of the general Pan-American treaty with
                            the Argentine Ambassador on the 20th, handing him the revised form which
                            we had agreed upon—a copy of which I enclose.<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d304fn1">Not printed.</note> At the time he said that there
                            would be, he feared, considerable objection to the arbitration provision
                            in the second article in that it placed a time limit upon the settlement
                            of disputed territorial claims.</p>
                        <p>The following day he sent me a counter-draft which I enclose for your
                                consideration.<note n="13" xml:id="d304fn2">Not printed.</note> I do
                            not think that the terms of article two meet the essential feature of
                            amicable settlement of disputes which the original draft covers by
                            providing arbitral proceedings. I do think, however, that there is
                            something to be said as to the removal <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489"
                                facs="0535"/>of the time limit since it might prevent objection
                            particularly from Chile.</p>
                        <p>I shall endeavor to see the Chilean Ambassador today or tomorrow in
                            regard to this matter and would like your comments on the Argentine
                            Ambassador’s counter-draft as soon as you can conveniently give them to

                            judgment about this. I think the only concession we can afford to make,
                            if these articles are indeed to serve as any sort of a model for the
                            action of other nations at any time, is to remove the definite time
                            limit in Article Two; and that Article Three should stand as in our
                            original. The new Article Three proposed by the Argentine Ambassador
                            seems to me distinctly inferior to the original. It does not include the
                            necessary reservation of questions of national honour, etc., upon which
                            our Senate would certainly insist, and it seems to end nowhere, but to
                            leave the whole thing vague. Do you not think so?</p>
                        <p>Article Two should, I think, provide that disputed questions of territory
                            should be settled as promptly as possible, i. e., diligently pushed to a
                            settlement.</p>

                            of a memorandum which was agreed upon in our conversation the other day

                            Ambassador who doubted the advisability of having a fixed time set for
                            the settlement of boundary disputes. With him I am more or less in
                            agreement but I do not approve of his counter-draft of which a copy is

                        <p>I finally saw the Chilean Ambassador yesterday in regard to the matter
                            and he is agreeable to have the matter taken up directly with his
                            Government through our Ambassador, which I believe will <pb n="490"
                                xml:id="pg_490" facs="0536"/>be the better way. I think I overcame
                            his objection to the guarantee of political independence but I think
                            there will be opposition to the submission to arbitration of disputed
                            territory between Chile and Peru on account of the importance of the
                            territory to Chile in its relation to the nitrate deposits. He asked me
                            to delay two or three days before taking the matter up with his
                            Government, in order that he could communicate with them in regard to
                            it. I of course had no option but to agree to this.</p>
                        <p>I wrote the President the other day in regard to the Argentine
                            Ambassador’s conversation with me and his objection to a time limit in
                            the matter of the settlement of boundary disputes, and he is agreeable
                            to leaving it indefinite, with the understanding that they shall be
                            settled as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>I hope that I can push matters more rapidly now. The difficulty has been
                            to get in touch with the Chilean Ambassador.</p>

                            with the Argentine Ambassador as to the inadvisability of having a fixed

                            we can cling to that in its entirety, the President will have succeeded
                            in his purpose.</p>
                        <p>My going to Washington is uncertain, but I hope to be there week after
                            next.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Chilean Ambassador
                            called to see me yesterday and informed me that he had communicated with
                            his Government and that the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs had said
                            something to Mr. Fletcher about the proposed propositions for a
                            Pan-American treaty, but had not intended to indicate to him that <pb
                                n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0537"/>the Government desired to
                            transfer the negotiations to Santiago. I explained to the Ambassador
                            that Mr. Fletcher had merely drawn that conclusion from having been
                            approached on the subject and that of course it was in no way desired to
                            have the negotiations conducted other than here in Washington if it was
                            agreeable to his Government. . . .</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Chilean Ambassador toward me in this matter is one of
                            the greatest friendliness and from a conversation I had with him a short
                            time ago I believe that he can be persuaded to advise his Government in
                            favor of the propositions as drafted. He told me that the first
                            proposition, granting territorial and political integrity, had been
                            presented to him by Mr. Bryan with practically no explanation as to the
                            meaning. After talking it over with him he felt that it was far less
                            objectionable than he had supposed and he believed that his Government
                            would not seriously object to it. Of course it is the first proposition
                            which is the essence of the compact and if we can secure his adhesion to
                            that we can, in all probability, remove anything objectionable in the
                            other propositions.</p>
                        <p>I will at once redraft the propositions eliminating the matter of time in
                            the settlement of boundary disputes, and submit to you.</p>

                                Convention.<note n="17" xml:id="d309fn1">Not enclosed with file copy
                                of this letter; for a later draft of the articles for the proposed
                                treaty, see <ref target="#pg_495">p. 495</ref>.</note> I have
                            drafted these after consultation with Ambassador Naón who is heartily in
                            favor of the plan as you know, and who understands the objections which
                            have been raised by the Chilean Ambassador in particular to the original
                            form.</p>
                        <p>Article II, you will see, I have greatly abbreviated because if the time
                            for settlement is eliminated it would be better for the negotiations in
                            my opinion to take this shorter form and not enter into such details as
                            the constitution of the arbitral tribunal which is to settle the
                            disputes.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that I have added a new article (Article IV) in place of
                            the one which covered the control of the manufacture and sale of arms
                            and ammunition. In order to prevent hostile action between neighbors it
                            is necessary, I think, to bind the parties not <pb n="492"
                                xml:id="pg_492" facs="0538"/>to assist insurgents or revolutionists
                            in the country. Such aid is a source of constant irritation in Central
                            American countries and as you know it is one of the causes of disorder
                            in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. I think, too, it is not unusual in
                            South America. I believe that the article would be received with general
                            approval and I cannot conceive of any serious objection to it.</p>
                        <p>If these articles, as revised, meet with your approval I will at once
                            take the matter up with Ambassador Suárez with the hope that I can
                            secure his adhesion and willingness to make a favorable report to his
                                Government.<note n="18" xml:id="d309fn2">President Wilson replied on

                            American Treaty—I have seen, in addition to the Ambassadors, nine of the
                            ministers, and given them copies of the four articles. They all express
                            personal delight at the Treaty and feel sure that their governments will
                            be glad to enter into such a convention. I have still the
                            representatives of three other countries to see, and hope to do so
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>The number of persons who know of this plan makes the possibility of
                            secrecy very difficult, in fact, some of the papers have already got
                            hold of the fact that there is some plan on foot for a Pan American
                            Agreement, or conference in line with the address which I made on
                            Monday. I have, since being questioned by one of the reporters on the
                            subject, notified all the Ambassadors and Ministers to be kind enough to
                            keep the matter secret. I had already told them that the matter was
                            confidential when I gave them the memorandum, but I am afraid that they
                            have showed it to some of their fellow-countrymen who are here attending
                            the Scientific Congress and so a considerable number are undoubtedly in
                            possession of the fact that we are attempting to unite the Americas in
                            an agreement of some sort. I thought I would tell you this so that you
                            will understand if you see anything in the papers on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday Ambassador Suárez said to me that he was in hopes of receiving
                            from his Government an acceptance of the plan and that he was most
                            desirous to obtain it and felt sure if a little time was given he could
                            do so. His change of attitude is certainly interesting.</p>

                                before the Second Pan American Scientific Congress.</note> that the
                            plan does not contemplate a guaranty of republican forms of government,
                            but removes from the benefit of the guaranty of territory and
                            independence a nation which abandons the republican form. The guaranty
                            of a republican form would, of course, be a direct interference with the
                            internal affairs of a country and entirely contrary to the views which
                            we have expressed and the course which we have followed in regard to the
                            sovereign right of a people to decide their domestic questions without
                            outside interference.</p>
                        <p>I make this suggestion in view of the opposition which may be aroused,
                            not only in this country, but in other American republics, if it is
                            thought that there is any plan to coerce the people of a sovereign state
                            in the conduct of their internal affairs.</p>

                            are at work to defeat the purposes of the treaty. Da Gama assured me
                            over two months ago, that there was no doubt but that his Government
                            would endorse the principle of the treaty, as he had been assured by it

                            Ambassador called here on Wednesday, the 15th, and I took up with him
                            the subject of the treaties with the Central and South American
                            Republics along the line you indicated in our talk on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>He quite agreed with you that it would be well to go ahead without Chile
                            . . . He suggested that as a possible compromise, the provision in
                            regard to the guaranteeing territorial integrity could be drawn to
                            provide for arbitration in case of disputes arising in the future, and
                            that a clause should be added providing that in cases of existing
                            disputes, these should be settled within a limited period through
                            diplomatic channels. After these disputes were settled, then the treaty
                            should apply to the disputed territory.</p>
                        <p>He has asked for an interview with you and will probably discuss this
                            matter at that interview. In the meantime it would be worth while
                            considering whether the compromise he suggests has any merit. <pb

                            merit, negotiations could be begun for concluding the treaties of the
                            countries that have accepted the original terms.</p>

                            Fletcher has arrived to make ready to go to Mexico. It occurs to me that
                            he will know more familiarly than any of the rest of us do the exact
                            sentiment of the Government of Chile with regard to the Pan-American
                            agreement. It occurs to me that he ought to learn from House all that
                            House originally ascertained when he began the negotiations about this
                            agreement at my request, while Mr. Bryan was Secretary. I would
                            appreciate it very much if you would write Mr. House a letter asking him
                            to work with Fletcher and give him what knowledge he has concerning the
                            matter. It is probable that Fletcher may be of real service to us in
                            this matter of dealing with the Latin-American countries because of his
                            long familiarity with the political atmosphere of the southern
                            continent. Perhaps it would be well, also, to send for Fletcher and have
                            him down here as soon as he has seen House.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Lansing</hi>: No progress has been made
                            in the negotiation of the Pan-American treaty during your absence. On
                            the 27th of June Naón informed me that he was not willing to proceed to
                            the signature of the treaty without consulting his Government, on
                            account of the tense United States-Mexican situation. He promised to let
                            me know as soon as he was in a position to proceed. He has not done so.
                            Lauro Müller<note n="22" xml:id="d317fn1">Brazilian Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> arrived in New York on the 18th. <pb n="497"

                                >J. B. Wright, Acting Chief of the Division of Latin American
                                Affairs, Department of State.</note> had two interviews with him,
                            but got nothing definite from him on the subject of the treaty.
                            Ambassador da Gama seems to think that it would be unfortunate to go
                            ahead with the treaty without Chile, and that we would lose all the
                            ground we have lately gained along the lines of true Pan-Americanism.
                            Mr. Lauro Müller is expected to return from French Lick in about a
                            week.</p>
                        <p>In view of the check put on the negotiation by Mr. Naón’s unwillingness
                            to agree to sign, I could not open out the treaty to the other
                            Republics. So the matter rests <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Chile is definitely and decidedly opposed to the treaty. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Mercurio</hi>—speaking for the
                            Government—characterizes it, in its 4th of July editorial, as a
                            “convention which involves vague and indeterminate powers of
                            intervention in the entire continent” and goes on to say that Chile does
                            not desire to remain isolated; that she understands her continental
                            duties and has lent her assistance or has taken important initiatives
                            tending to establish that policy. But Chile sustains that the
                            Pan-Americanism of concord and equality is a measure of union, but that
                            Pan-Americanism of predominance is a serious obstacle to guaranteeing
                            that cordiality which is indispensable in foreign affairs. A treaty
                            which would give <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> preponderance to one
                            part of the continent over the other would tend to destroy true
                            Pan-American confraternity. It is becoming generally known among the
                            diplomats in Washington that Chile objects to the treaty, and the
                            British Ambassador insinuated to me that the negotiations which Chile is
                            said to be carrying on now with representatives of the Deutsche Bank in
                            New York for a loan might be attributed to the lack of agreement between
                            Chile and the United States over this treaty. I do not believe this is
                            the case, but on the other hand I feel sure that if we go on without
                            Chile, that is, isolating her from the American concert, she will turn
                            naturally elsewhere in finance and trade, and that gradually a spirit of
                            hostility against the United States will be engendered.</p>
                        <p>My advices from Chile show that they believe we are going ahead with the
                            treaty, and they feel that we are placing them unnecessarily in a false
                            position. If, therefore, neither Argentina nor Brazil really means to go
                            ahead, I think we should know it and act accordingly; otherwise we are
                            uselessly and needlessly alienating the goodwill of Chile.</p>

                            consideration the report of a conversation which Mr. Polk had Saturday
                            with the Brazilian Ambassador in regard to the Pan-American Treaty.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>I assume from what Mr. Polk told me of his interview that Müller desired
                            speedy action, that is, a negotiation of the treaty prior to Brazil’s
                            entering the war. It is just possible that the Brazilian Government
                            would like to use the treaty as another excuse for declaring war against
                            Germany, a course of action which it seems certain will be pursued,
                            though I do not think so.</p>
                        <p>I am not prepared yet to give you my opinion as to the wisdom of signing
                            such a treaty at the present time. It might in certain circumstances
                            (for example, Argentina’s friendliness for Germany) cause much
                            embarrassment. It might of course draw some of the smaller American
                            Republics into the war, but I am not at all sure that would be a benefit
                            as we might have to aid them.</p>
                        <p>It requires, I think, very careful consideration before we decide.</p>

                            think the matter over carefully, and there are some difficulties which
                            seem involved if a general invitation is issued to all the countries to

                            ally of Germany against her European enemies (I am thinking particularly
                            of Mexico where the oil wells at Tampico may cause trouble). In that
                            event would we be bound under the Treaty to maintain the guarantee of
                            territorial integrity with force of arms? Or it might be that a
                            signatory might permit its territory to become the base of German
                            military or naval operations (as might be the case of Ecuador in regard
                            to the Galapagos Islands, or of Colombia in regard to her coasts). Could
                            we observe the territorial integrity of the nation permitting this? Or
                            could we do so if a Latin American <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499"
                                facs="0545"/>country permitted its territory to become a refuge for
                            Germans where they could conspire and carry on their propaganda in this
                            country and other countries?</p>
                        <p>Possibly this difficulty could be cured by limiting at present the
                            signatories to such governments as declare war against Germany, sever
                            relations with that Government, or declare a benevolent neutrality with
                            the assurance that they will only enter the war on our side or as our
                            ally.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore under the guarantee of territorial integrity and political
                            independence would the other signatories be bound to declare war against
                            Germany? If it could be so interpreted, what I have said above has no
                            weight. But could it be, unless our territory or waters were actually
                            invaded by the Germans?</p>
                        <p>These are the questions which have been running through my mind and I
                            would like your opinion upon them.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The answers to the
                            important questions you here raise are reasonably clear to me. (By the
                            way, I do not find among my papers here the Brazilian proposals you
                            spoke of the other day).</p>
                        <p>If any one of the signatories to our proposed Pan-American treaty should
                            become an ally of Germany against her European enemies, we would
                            undoubtedly be bound to protect her against any loss of territory or any
                            curtailment of her political independence that any of the Entente group
                            might attempt; but we would be obliged to do that in any case, under the
                            Monroe Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Should any one of the signatories permit its territory to be used as a
                            base of military or naval operations against us, it would manifestly be
                            acting in contravention of the patent meaning of the pact and we would
                            be free to act as if there were no pact.</p>
                        <p>As for “influences” and propaganda, we could not prevent them, any more
                            than Great Britain has been able to prevent them in the United States,
                            where they were very formidable, though they of course did not have the
                            countenance of the Government.</p>
                        <p>I do not see that the other signatories would in the present
                            circumstances be obligated to declare war on Germany. They would be
                            obligated to come to our assistance with arms only when our political
                            independence or territorial integrity were evidently and immediately
                            threatened.</p>
                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0546"/>
                        <p>These questions do not seem to me to constitute difficulties of practical
                            importance. If we can meet Brazil’s wishes sufficiently to get her
                            adherence to the pact, I shall feel warranted in pressing on. It seems
                            to me that this is the very time when such a league would make the
                            deepest impression and have the greatest moral effect on both sides of
                            the water.</p>

                        <p>The Danish Minister called this morning to say that he had received from
                            his Government another dispatch in regard to the suggested sale to the
                            United States of the Danish West Indies. He said that he was under a
                            considerable embarrassment about a question which his Government had
                            asked but which he had hesitated to present to me. It was this: Whether
                            he thought that in case the Danish <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502"
                                facs="0548"/>Government did not agree to a sale of the Islands
                            whether the United States would feel it necessary to take possession of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that while I had not had in mind such action at the
                            present time, as I had hoped that some form of negotiations would result
                            in the transfer of the sovereignty of the Islands to this Government,
                            that I could conceive of circumstances which would compel such an act on
                            our part. He asked me what those circumstances were, and I replied that
                            the possible consequence of absorption of Denmark by a great power would
                            create a situation which it would be difficult to meet other than by
                            occupation of the Islands, and such action would undoubtedly cause
                            serious consequences.</p>
                        <p>The other circumstance was that if Denmark voluntarily, or under
                            coercion, transferred title to the Danish West Indies to another
                            European power, which would seek to convert them into a naval base.</p>
                        <p>He said that he appreciated our position and would communicate with his
                            Government. I urged him to lay before his Government the possibility of
                            preserving by special privilege all the commercial opportunities which
                            the ownership of the Islands gave to Denmark, even if the sovereignty
                            was ceded to the United States and that I was convinced that such
                            transfer would be acceptable to this Government.</p>

                        <p>“As I have already advised you in an earlier cablegram, the cession of
                            the Danish West India Islands would in Denmark be felt as a great
                            national loss, and only under the pressure of necessity would our
                            country consider consenting to such a step.</p>
                        <p>When however the United States, in spite of their friendly feelings
                            towards us and notwithstanding their respect for our sovereign rights,
                            consider it possible that, in the situations which have been suggested,
                            circumstances could compel them to occupy the islands, and as Denmark
                            for this reason must count on being in the future so situated with
                            regard to the islands, that it, if it declines to enter into
                            negotiations, will constantly have to fear being drawn into an
                            international conflict in the situations which have been suggested, then
                            our country is placed in such a position that it will not be able to
                            refuse to consider a proposition from the United States, if such a
                            proposition should be made.”</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: You will recall that I
                            told you of the informal conversations I have had with the Danish
                            Minister in regard to the purchase by this Government of the Danish West
                            Indies. As doubtless the course of these negotiations have slipped your
                            memory I will repeat what took place.</p>
                        <p>In October I spoke to the Danish Minister of the desire of this
                            Government to consider the purchase of the Islands if agreeable to his
                            Government, and that I would be pleased if he would communicate with the
                            Danish Foreign Office in regard to this matter, keeping it of course
                            entirely informal at present. Some days later he replied to my inquiry
                            that his Government at the present time would not negotiate upon the
                            subject as they had very large commercial interests which were vastly
                            increased by the construction of the Panama Canal. I then suggested to
                            him that we might, in case his Government would consider the purchase,
                            incorporate certain commercial privileges in favor of Danish subjects,
                            as our interest in the Islands was largely naval.</p>
                        <p>About the first of November he communicated this second proposition to
                            his Government, adding what I had said in a general way that under
                            certain conditions the United States might find it necessary to occupy
                            the Islands in case Denmark should lose sovereignty over them.</p>
                        <p>On November 15th the Minister again called to see me about the matter and
                            said he was under considerable embarrassment about a question which his
                            Government had asked, but which he had hesitated to present to me. The
                            question was this: “Whether he thought in case the Danish Government did
                            not agree to a sale of the Islands the United States would feel it
                            necessary to take possession of them.”</p>
                        <p>In reply I told the Minister that while it had not been in my mind that
                            action of this sort would be necessary, as I had hoped some formal
                            negotiation would result in the transfer of the sovereignty, that I
                            could conceive of circumstances which would compel such an act on our
                            part. He asked me what these circumstances were and I replied that they
                            were the ones to which I had previously called his attention, namely,
                            the possible consequence of absorption of Denmark by one of the great
                            powers of Europe. Such a loss of sovereignty would create a situation
                            which it would be difficult to meet other than by occupation of the
                            Islands, in view of the fact that Danish possessions would come under a
                            different sovereignty in Europe and in case it did, the result might be
                            very serious.</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>The other circumstance was that if Denmark voluntarily, or under
                            coercion, transferred title to the Islands to another European power,
                            which would seek to convert them into a naval base.</p>
                        <p>The Minister called upon me on the first and left a paraphrase of a
                            cablegram received by him on the 25th ultimo from the Danish Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs of which I enclose you a copy.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d326fn1">

                        </p>
                        <p>I also enclose a telegram just received from our Minister at
                                Copenhagen,<note n="5" xml:id="d326fn2">Not printed.</note> which is
                            in line with the paraphrase.</p>
                        <p>I believe we are now in a position to enter into negotiations for the
                            purchase of the Islands. You will observe that the question of Greenland
                            is involved. I do not think it is of material importance, but propose to
                            ask to what extent possession is intended, because much of the Island is
                            still unexplored. I believe that Denmark will ask a very considerable
                            sum for the Islands but we will know more when we begin
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>If the reply to our inquiry in regard to Greenland is satisfactory I
                            will, with your consent, proceed to the direct negotiations of a treaty
                            of cession.</p>
                        <p>I think I should add that in my opinion the Danish Government very
                            possibly considers the Islands a menace to their sovereignty in Europe
                            in that if the Islands are coveted by another European power the easiest
                            method, and possibly the only method by which they could obtain legal
                            possession of the Islands, would be their absorption of the Danish
                            sovereignty.</p>

                            cession with that amount as a consideration. I will advise you in case I

                                    Interview With the Danish Minister</hi> (<hi rend="italic"

                            <p>The Danish Minister called on me this afternoon and stated that he
                                had received word from his Government that they had made an offer to
                                negotiate for the sale of the Danish West Indies on the basis of a
                                hundred million kroner which, the Minister said, equal $27,000,000.
                                I told Mr. Brun that this Government would consider such an amount
                                too great a consideration for the Islands—that we were not good
                                bargainers, and when I suggested that $20,000,000 might form a basis
                                for negotiation I had stated the maximum sum which this Government
                                was willing to consider—that he must understand, being here in
                                America, the difficulties at the present time which the Government
                                was having in raising sufficient funds for carrying out a policy of
                                preparedness and that he must know that any such sum as $27,000,000
                                would, in all probability, be disapproved by Congress; that I hoped,
                                therefore, he would explain this fully to his Government and I
                                thought when they understood the situation they would be willing to
                                modify their figures.</p>
                            <p>The Minister also spoke to me about the desire of his Government to
                                obtain from this Government an agreement by protocol that it would
                                not object to the extension of Danish occupation of Greenland. I
                                told him that the Danish West Indies and Greenland should be
                                combined in one negotiation; that Denmark had something which we
                                desired, and that evidently we had something which Denmark desired;
                                that it seemed to me it would be possibly the most advisable way to
                                incorporate the two subjects in one treaty rather than to <pb
                                    n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0552"/>have a treaty of cession of
                                the Danish West Indies and a protocol relating to Greenland. The
                                Minister said he had no objection to adopting this course.</p>
                            <p>He also left with me a memorandum relative to Greenland<note n="7"
                                    xml:id="d328fn1">Not printed.</note> which embodied instructions
                                which he had received from his Government.</p>
                            <p>The Minister left with the understanding that he would communicate
                                fully to his Government the views which had been expressed by
                                me.</p>

                            left with me this noon a paraphrase of a cablegram which he had received
                            yesterday from his Government—a copy of which is herewith enclosed.<note

                        </p>
                        <p>You will perceive that the Danish Government continues to insist upon
                            their previously stated consideration for the Danish West Indies,
                            namely, 100,000,000 kroner, which is equivalent to $27,000,000. I would
                            like your views in regard to the matter. I confess that the amount seems
                            to me large. At the same time I believe the purchase of the Islands
                            would meet with general approval in view of the public opinion of the
                            country in regard to national defense. I should dislike very much to see
                            the negotiations fail, or the treaty if negotiated, fail on account of
                            the amount agreed upon as the purchase price.</p>
                        <p>Do you think it would be well for you to take the matter up with Senator
                            Stone, or any other Senators, in order to find out their opinion as to
                            what the temper of the Senate would be in case we made a treaty on the
                            basis of $27,000,000?</p>

                            with our conversation on January 19th I at once cabled to the Danish
                            Government suggesting that they should agree to a sum of 25 (twenty
                            five) Million Dollars being named as a base for the negotiation and
                            consideration of a treaty for the transfer of the Danish West India
                            Islands to the sovereignty of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am today in receipt of a cablegram from the Danish Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs authorizing me to agree to the said proposition.</p>
                        <p>The Minister adds that he will now expect to receive a draft of the
                            treaty to be negotiated between you and myself, and he also submits to
                            you that for reasons which I believe are obvious it is desirable that
                            the matter should be proceeded with as speedily as possible.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Senator Stone</hi>: With respect to the
                            proposed treaty with Denmark ceding the Danish West Indies to the United
                            States, which is now before your Committee, perhaps I may be allowed to
                            say that it is, to my mind, of the greatest importance that the treaty
                            should be reported out of the Committee as soon as possible, so that the
                            treaty can be considered by the Senate before adjournment. I have
                            already stated to the Committee orally that while one of the prior
                            treaties for the transfer of the Islands was based on strategic grounds,
                            and the other on political grounds, the present treaty is based on both
                            grounds. The particulars as to both of these grounds I need not mention,
                            as Senators who have followed the progress of the international
                            relations of the United States and the expansion of American interests
                            in Central America will readily perceive the force of these grounds upon
                            which I hesitate to write in detail.</p>
                        <p>As to immediate ratification of the treaty by the United States, I may
                            add that when the treaty was signed it was agreed that it should be
                            submitted at once to the Senate, and the Danish Parliament, and prompt
                            action by them urged, in order to avoid a delay which might develop
                            unforeseen difficulties in the consummation of the treaty. As I have
                            told you, ratification of the treaty by Denmark has been deferred by the
                            Danish Parliament until a new election can be held in October and
                            November. This, however, should not, I think, cause the United States to
                            delay its action on the treaty, for to do so would not only be contrary
                            to the arrangement made with the Danish Government at the time of
                            signature, but such action, as I understand the situation, could not be
                            supported by any good reason. Certainly it could not, I think, be looked
                            upon by Denmark, in view of the arrangement at the time of signature, as
                            in any way bringing pressure to bear upon her to ratify the treaty. In
                            fact, to defer the ratification here might give the opposition in
                            Denmark some capital for arguing that the transfer could be deferred <pb
                                n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0555"/>until the close of the present
                            war, on account of the little interest shown in the matter by the United
                            States. If it is the opinion of your Committee that the treaty should be
                            favorably reported by it and passed upon by the Senate before
                            adjournment, it seems to me wise that this action should be taken
                            immediately, as otherwise opponents to the consummation of the treaty,
                            if there are any—I know of none—will have opportunity to endeavor to
                            show reasons why the treaty should not be ratified. What these grounds
                            might be, I do not know, but it is conceivable that the terms of the
                            treaty might become known through some source or other, and that as a
                            result certain business interests in the Islands might feel dissatisfied
                            with its provisions and might cause pressure to be brought to prevent
                            the ratification of the treaty. You will doubtless be able to conceive
                            of other conditions which might arise inimicable to the Convention.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, therefore, I am strongly of the opinion that your Committee
                            and the Senate should act on this treaty at the earliest moment, as I
                            can see no reasonable ground why such action should be postponed, while
                            every reason persuades me that it should be immediate.</p>

                            your attention to the enclosed telegram sent over from the Navy
                                Department<note n="11" xml:id="d335fn1">Not printed; outlined plans
                                of naval representatives in the West Indies for the formal transfer

                            present time that our naval officers are being so active in connection
                            with the Danish West Indies, as it is almost certain to become public
                            and if so may arouse considerable resentment in Congress and impair the
                            course of the necessary legislation for acquiring the Islands. It seems
                            to me that this matter of taking possession of the Islands rests
                            primarily with you and before anything is done I would like to talk with
                            you on the subject.</p>

                            from acting without authority in these matters.</p>

                            you have a talk with the Secretary of the Navy about this, telling him
                            with entire frankness what you think the dangers and prudences of the
                            situation are. He will see at once what is involved, and will wish, I am
                            sure, to cooperate with you in every way.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that all that his officers are doing now is to keep an eye on
                            what is happening in and about the islands and to get as much useful
                            information as possible,—both very wise things to do, if wisely done. We

                            twenty-five million dollars and take possession of the Danish West
                            Indies before April 17th. That leaves us less than a month to make the
                            arrangements for the formal delivery of the islands and payment of the
                            money, which in view of the necessary communications with Copenhagen is
                            a very short time. We ought to start without delay.</p>
                        <p>You have not indicated to me whether you have decided to have the War or
                            Navy Department take control of the provisional government. That is of
                            course the first question to be determined, because we must consult with
                            the officials of the Department selected as to the formalities and the
                            officers to administer the affairs of the islands. After this is decided
                            I will name an official of the State Department to consult with an
                            official of the other Department and also with the Danish Minister as to
                            the procedure to be followed.</p>
                        <p>On account of the naval importance of the new acquisition as well as the
                            marked efficiency shown by the naval officers in the conduct of affairs
                            in Haiti and the Dominican Republic I personally favor the assignment of
                            the duty of Government for the present to the Navy Department, although
                            I realize that the War Department is especially equipped for
                            administration of insular possessions. In voicing this opinion I do not
                            intend to criticize in any way the War <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511"
                                facs="0557"/>Department, which would undoubtedly do well in the
                            administration of the civil government of the islands. My opinion is
                            based on the fact that from the viewpoint of national defense the
                            problems are essentially naval and that the administration of affairs
                            and control of the public properties and improvements should be
                            subordinated to the plans and purposes of the General Board of the Navy.
                            I fear that with the War Department in control there might be failure to
                            carry out these plans and purposes properly and there is always the
                            possibility of friction as to the policies to be adopted.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you will be able to give me very promptly a decision in this
                            matter as I feel that there is no time to lose in arranging for the
                            formal delivery of the islands.</p>

                            since Mr. Bryan handled the matter without discussing it with me. As a
                            result I know very little of the objections raised by the Senate.
                            Whatever they were they seem to have been effective thus far in
                            preventing consent.</p>
                        <p>As I recall the press reports, one of the objections, of which much was
                            made, was the so-called “apology” (expression of regret) by this
                            Government; and another was that the amount to be paid to Colombia was
                            considered excessive.</p>
                        <p>The first objection might possibly be removed by an expression of <hi
                                rend="underline">mutual</hi> regret instead of one by our Government
                            alone. Perhaps it will not be thought politic to do this, but I am so
                            anxious to see the treaty accepted by the Senate that any suggestion
                            which would remove objections seems to me worthy of consideration. I
                            append a tentative redraft of Article I in line with this
                                suggestion.<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">Not printed.</note>

                            to Colombia might not the consent of that government be obtained to
                            reduce it? Would it be worth while to attempt to have that government
                            agree to such reduction? I believe that in view of the present financial
                            situation of this Government as a result of the European War, the
                            objection as to amount will be stronger than before. I would suggest,
                            therefore, that whatever the total sum may be, this objection would be
                            weakened by amending the terms of payment in some manner such as the following:<list>

                            Government is, of course, very sensitive about this matter and we, on
                            our part, are, I think, pledged to the utmost to stand by the terms of
                            the treaty as drawn. I think, moreover, that it is likely that the views
                            of some Senators will prove to have been a good deal modified since the
                            last session by a fuller knowledge of all that is involved.</p>

                        <p>I think, however, that it would not be wise to act in this matter as you
                            suggest until you can have an interview with Senator Stone and find out
                            exactly what the obstacles in the Senate were, and how they are likely
                            to be most successfully dealt with. It would hardly do to act on the
                            newspaper versions of what they were.</p>
                        <p>I wonder if you could obtain such an interview in time, or whether,
                            lacking that, you could get from Senator Stone a letter giving the whole
                            case as it stands in his view?</p>

                            German Legation, here, speaking of the enterprise of the
                            Hamburg-Colombian Banana Company in the Gulf of Darien, said that “the
                            real reason . . . is . . .<note n="5" xml:id="d344fn2">Omissions
                                indicated in original despatch.</note> our desire to possess a
                            coaling station of our own in the Carribean.” I desire <pb n="515"
                                xml:id="pg_515" facs="0561"/>also to call your special attention to
                            a letter of November 29, 1912, addressed to the President of the United
                            States by my predecessor, Mr. Du Bois, on file in the Department of
                                State.<note n="6" xml:id="d344fn3">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> Referring to the concession granted by the Colombian
                            Government to this banana company of ten thousand acres, he says: “It is
                            within easy access to coal deposits. The concession includes the widest
                            privileges, railroads, telegraph, pier and wharf construction,—a very
                            liberal banana concession,” and he suggests that “Only the future will
                            disclose what there is in this concession and the disclosure may come at
                            a time least expected and least desired”. Events since the beginning of
                            the European war have emphasized the apprehension of Mr. Du Bois
                            expressed nearly two years before that conflagration broke out.</p>
                        <p>On the directorate of the Banana Company appear the names of Herr Ballin,
                            director of the Hamburg American Line, and of Herr Thomann, one of the
                            largest stockholders of that line. Mr. Du Bois says that “during the
                            first three months of 1912 the German Minister near the Colombian
                            Government made an inspection along the Atlantic and Pacific Coast lines
                            of Colombia, visiting every port and possible port; made a prolonged
                            stay in the Gulf of Urabá; and secured statistics and photographs of the
                            improvements being made at Puerto Cesar”.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The German activities in the Caribbean, it would seem, should be
                            sufficient to emphasize the necessity for having the friendship
                            especially of Colombia and Costa Rica to strengthen our national
                            defenses. I am also reporting by this mail that the attorney who secured
                            a concession for a coaling station in Cartagena Bay (not yet approved by
                            Congress) is also acting as attorney for the German Legation here; and
                            it appears to me certain that the Germans have been making preparations
                            in this country to test the strength of our support of the Monroe
                            Doctrine and extremely probable, in such an event, that if our Senate
                            rejects the Treaty, Colombia will not oppose, if indeed it does not
                            assist, the landing of German troops on its soil for an attack on the
                            Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>Without taking into consideration the commercial advantages to be derived
                            from the settlement of a question that has caused so much friction
                            between the two Republics, it occurs to me that the friends of the
                            Treaty might gain a few votes by pressing this argument at the present
                            time when the Nation is aroused to the necessity for preparedness. Most
                            of our national legislators are in total ignorance of what has been
                            transpiring on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0562"/>
                        <p>One point in the Treaty which seems to meet with some opposition is the
                            expression of regret by the United States; if it should appear that this
                            endangered the entire Treaty, I would suggest that the Senate amend it
                            so as to make the expression of regret mutual on the part of Colombia
                            and the United States. The present Minister for Foreign Affairs informed
                            me confidentially last year that he desired this from the beginning but
                            that the other members of the Commission on Foreign Affairs refused it
                            positively when the negotiations were in progress. I believe that an
                            amendment making the expression of regret mutual would now be accepted
                            by the Colombian Congress.</p>

                            be of capital importance, especially in view of what Mr. Thomson tells
                            us of the activity of German influences in Colombia and the movement of

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: After consultations
                            with Senators Swanson, Knox and Lodge I am convinced that the present
                            Colombian <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0563"/>Treaty could only
                            obtain senatorial consent by the acceptance of several amendments, which
                            would require the assent of Colombia, and would leave the finished
                            treaty to my mind in a very confused and, if I may use the
                            term—inartistic form. Such amendments I feel would also be viewed as
                            criticisms of the Administration.</p>
                        <p>A careful canvass of the situation seems to assure thirty-seven votes in
                            opposition to the treaty even as amended by the Committee.</p>
                        <p>My suggestion is that, since in any event the treaty will require further
                            action by Colombia, the simplest and most expedient method is to
                            negotiate a new treaty. With that idea in mind I send you a proposed
                                draft.<note n="9" xml:id="d346fn2">Not printed.</note> This treaty I
                            can guarantee will be accepted by the Senate but of course I cannot
                            speak for Colombia, though that Government will be very anxious to get
                            the twenty-five millions.</p>
                        <p>The most radical change is the omission of Article I of the present
                            treaty. I feel that in view of the proviso added by the Senate Committee
                            as to denial of criticism of any Administration Article I means nothing.
                            I understand that that proviso was a concession to Senator Knox. Its
                            effect, however, neutralizes every expression of regret in Article
                            I.</p>
                        <p>I enclose also a memorandum<note n="9" xml:id="d346fn3">Not

                            of these additions and changes.</p>

                            morning with the deposed President of Costa Rica<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d348fn1">Señor Alfredo González Flores.</note> who was
                            introduced by his Minister. He made upon me a most favorable impression
                            as a man of high motives and real patriotism.</p>
                        <p>The causes of the rebellion appear to be chiefly two, the avarice of
                            Tinoco and his family and the opposition of certain interests to the
                            numerous reforms in taxation and fiscal matters which the President
                            supported and carried through. He appears to have been a real
                            progressive in his ideas and sought to give the poorer classes a <pb
                                n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0565"/>better chance than they have
                            had before. He told me that the hostility of the privileged rich and the
                            ignorance of the poor were the immediate cause of his overthrow together
                            with the great confidence which he had placed in the loyalty of
                            Tinoco.</p>
                        <p>I told him that we would not recognize Tinoco or any government growing
                            out of the revolution and that privileges or concessions granted by such
                            government would not be supported by this Government. He seemed very
                            much pleased by this statement, and said that he was very grateful as a
                            Costa Rican but he was strongly opposed to any intervention on our part.
                            He did not seek to be reseated as President; all he wished was the
                            restoration of constitutional government. If that could be done without
                            him he was entirely satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Following your expressed willingness to see the President I asked Mr.
                            Phillips to arrange a time when he could call upon you. I will be
                            interested to know if he makes upon you the same favorable impression
                            which he made upon me.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: As you know the
                            situation in Costa Rica has been an increasing cause of concern and the
                            course of action to be adopted more and more perplexing.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>We are in this peculiar predicament. The policy of recognizing a
                            government founded on unprincipled revolution is essentially bad and
                            induces the hope of revolutionists in other small republics.</p>
                        <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0566"/>
                        <p>There is no doubt but that in this case Tinoco took advantage for his own
                            benefit of the unpopularity of Gonzales and without a shadow of legality
                            usurped the executive power. There is nothing to be said in his
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the people of Costa Rica in general appear to have
                            peaceably acquiesced in the change of government although the failure of
                            Tinoco to rectify immediately the economic situation seems to promise
                            further political disturbances unless his Government is stabilized by
                            recognition by this Government.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, there is no doubt from the evidence in hand but that the
                            Gonzales faction is friendly to the Germans, while Tinoco is wholly
                            friendly to the Allies. It seems to be almost certain that the German
                            element in Costa Rica is stirring up feeling against Tinoco and is
                            financing a revolutionary movement, of which Castro Quesada (the
                            Minister here), now in Nicaragua, would be the leader and probably the
                            president if the revolution succeeded. . . .</p>
                        <p>Viewed solely from the standpoint of expediency, it would seem as if the
                            recognition of Tinoco was, under present conditions, probably the better
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>When we gave strong assurances to Gonzales not to recognize Tinoco we
                            were not at war with Germany, and we were not acquainted with the
                            relations of the influential German colony to the rival factions in
                            Costa Rica. We know now that Tinoco has been all along staunchly opposed
                            to the Germans, and that Gonzales and especially Quesada have been most
                            friendly with them.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances it would seem to be unwise to aid by action or
                            inaction the restoration of a pro-German government even if it is
                            morally and legally entitled to be restored. As to the danger which
                            might result from following a policy now we are at war, which policy
                            would have doubtless been the better in time of peace, I call your
                            attention to the enclosed telegram of yesterday from General
                                Plummer,<note n="4" xml:id="d350fn1">Not enclosed with file copy of
                                this letter.</note> who recommends the immediate recognition of
                            Tinoco on military grounds.</p>
                        <p>Both the British and French have unofficially indicated their desire that
                            we recognize the present government for reasons which I assume to be
                            known—friendliness of Tinoco and hostility of Gonzalez.</p>
                        <p>I make no reference to the fact that the recognition of Tinoco would
                            undoubtedly benefit the Costa Ricans by preventing another revolution
                            which would not be bloodless, as I think that at the present time the
                            greater issues must alone be considered.</p>
                        <p>Things are moving very rapidly in Costa Rica. The situation may change
                            any day. A decision should be reached very promptly and action follow
                            immediately.</p>
                        <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>I regret to have to ask you to go through so many papers but in this case
                            I think that it is necessary as the state of affairs is very
                            critical.</p>

                            encouragement to armed revolution and to prevent the censor from sending
                            the filed cablegram to Castro Quesada, who is the moving spirit in this
                            affair.</p>
                        <p>This I did in accordance with our policy not to countenance the use of
                            force in gaining control of the government, a policy, which you may
                            remember, I declared to Gonzales and Quesada when they called upon me
                            several months ago. It seemed to me that we could not do less than
                            pursue this policy in the case of the present movement.</p>
                        <p>We are in a peculiarly embarrassing situation in regard to Costa Rica,
                            since our settled policy as to nonrecognition of Tinoco, which I feel we
                            ought to continue, runs directly contrary to our interests in
                            prosecuting the war. There seems little doubt (although I hope to be
                            absolutely certain in a short time) that Castro Quesada and his party
                            are pro-German and receiving financial support from the Germans in their
                            revolutionary activities. Tinoco, on the other hand, <pb n="522"
                                xml:id="pg_522" facs="0568"/>by inclination or for politic reasons,
                            is pro-Ally. Gonzales, the deposed President, counts little, Quesada
                            being the strong man. . . .</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances I do not feel that we should give encouragement to
                            Quesada or, on the other hand, protect Tinoco. I, therefore, adopted the
                            course which I have stated and which is consistent with our announced
                            policy. I think until we are fully satisfied about Quesada and the
                            Germans we should maintain this attitude.</p>

                            Admiral Benson, who is acting Secretary of the Navy, he has submitted to
                            me a memorandum embodying instructions to be sent to Admiral Caperton at
                            Port au Prince. If you approve the instructions will you wire him to
                            that effect as soon as possible?</p>
                        <p>I had a lengthy interview this morning with the Haitian Minister
                            regarding affairs of that Republic. He tells me that the people there
                            are doubtful as to our motives, although he personally realizes that we
                            are acting in perfect good faith and are only attempting to assist
                            Haiti. I assured him of our entirely unselfish motives and that in
                            landing marines in Haiti we had acted on account of two reasons: first,
                            that it was in the interest of humanity and, second, that in case we had
                            not taken the step, in all probability some other nation would have felt
                            called upon to do so. I further said to him that the intelligent
                            Haitians should feel gratified that it was the United States rather than
                            some other power whose motives might not be as unselfish as ours.</p>

                            to the Secretary of the Navy, <ref target="frus1915#pg_478">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1915, page 478</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>Admiral Benson informed me that he did not think we needed to occupy Mole
                            St. Nicholas. I asked him to submit the matter to the General Board of
                            the Navy Department which was then in session. He did so and brought
                            back a report that “The General Board sees no necessity for naval
                            purposes to have a station at St. Nicholas Mole.” The report goes on to
                            state the reasons for their decision which is substantially the same one
                            which they reached on October 17 last year.</p>
                        <p>In view of the telegram from Admiral Caperton above repeated, and the
                            report of the Board, it is proposed to send the following telegram to
                            Admiral Caperton if it meets with your approval:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Allow election of President to take place whenever Haitians wish.
                                United States prefers election of Dartiguenave.</p>
                            <p>United States appreciates generous disposition of Haitian people
                                regarding cession of St. Nicholas Mole, but wishes to assure them
                                United States desire no Haitian territory and has no other motive
                                than the establishing of a firm and lasting government by the
                                Haitian people, and to assist them now and at all times in the
                                future to maintain their political independence and territorial
                                integrity unimpaired.</p>
                            <p>The United States will insist that the Haitian government will grant
                                no territorial concession to any foreign governments.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>I believe that the declaration in regard to Mole St. Nicholas and also
                            our willingness to have the election of President proceed will have a
                            very salutary effect upon public opinion in Haiti. I do not see why it
                            would not be as easy to control a government with a president as it is
                            to control the Haitian Congress and administrative officers. I would
                            advise, therefore, sending the proposed telegram.</p>
                        <p>If possible it is advisable that an answer should be received by wire
                            from you today in order that Admiral Caperton receive his instructions
                            promptly.</p>

                            <p>Whenever the Haitians wish you may permit the election of a President
                                to take place. The election of Dartiguenave is preferred by United
                                States. You will assure the Haitians that the United States has no
                                other motive than the establishing of a firm and lasting government
                                by the Haitian people and wishes to assist them now and at all times
                                in the future to maintain both their political independence and
                                territorial integrity unimpaired. That the Haitian Government will
                                grant no territorial concessions to any foreign governments will be
                                insisted upon by the United States. The question of the session of
                                Mole St. Nicholas will be taken up later by the government of the
                                United States along with the other questions to be submitted to the
                                reorganized government with regard to its relations to the United

                        </p>
                        <p>I believe that I informed you yesterday in our interview that the Haytien
                            Congress adjourns next Tuesday and, therefore, if we intend to sign a
                            treaty and have it ratified by that congress, which is so friendly to
                            our Government, before our own Congress assembles in December, there is
                            no time for delay. If it is to be done at all, it will have to be done
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>I confess that this method of negotiation, with our marines policing the
                            Haytien Capital, is high handed. It does not meet my sense of a nation’s
                            sovereign rights and is more or less an exercise of force and an
                            invasion of Haytien independence. From a practical standpoint, however,
                            I cannot but feel that it is the only thing to do if we intend to cure
                            the anarchy and disorder which prevails in that Republic. I believe it
                            will be welcomed by the better element of the Haytien people, who now do
                            not dare to take part in public affairs on account of the danger of
                            assassination and massacre. It does not seem to me that the so-called
                            Haytien revolutions are revolutions in fact, but, in reality, represent
                            the struggle of bandits for control of the machinery of government which
                            they utilize solely for the purpose of plunder. None of these so-called
                            “generals” represent a principle or represent in any way the people of
                            Haiti. The only possible way, it seems to me, of restoring to the
                            Haytiens their political and personal rights and protecting them from
                            the terrorism of unscrupulous military leaders is to obtain control, for
                            a time at least, of the prize which these chieftains seek, namely, the
                            public revenues of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>I have not been unmindful of the possible criticism which may be aroused
                            in the Senate in case this treaty should be signed and submitted to them
                            for action. As I said, it seems a high handed procedure, but I do not
                            see how else we can obtain the desirable end of <pb n="527"

                            Haiti and maintaining domestic peace there.</p>
                        <p>I have seen the French Ambassador this morning in regard to the
                            contractual obligations of the Haytien Government to the Bank of Haiti,
                            which is a French corporation. In that connection I enclose, for your
                            information, a memorandum of the provisions of the contract, which was
                            submitted to the Department yesterday by Mr. Casenave, the President of
                            the Bank.<note n="6" xml:id="d358fn3">Memorandum not enclosed with file
                                copy of this letter.</note> In case this treaty should become
                            operative there would have to be an exchange of notes between the French
                            Ambassador and this Department, in which we would state that the bank
                            would continue to be the depository of the public funds of Haiti. While
                            I did not disclose to the French Ambassador the text of the treaty, I
                            suggested to him that we might feel compelled, in the interest of the
                            Haytien people, to take charge of their finances and support the
                            established government. With this he was heartily in accord, provided
                            that we would protect the Bank of Haiti in its rights. The Ambassador
                            evidenced a sentimental interest in the Republic and expressed the hope
                            that we would not endeavor to change its language from French to
                            English. As to that I gave him assurance that we had no such
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>This newly proposed treaty I prepared as soon as possible. I regret that
                            I have not been able to send it to you sooner or to talk over the
                            details of the plan, because I realize it is establishing a policy
                            considerably in advance of our Dominican policy. The necessity of speedy
                            action is my excuse for, if anything is to be done, a decision must be
                            reached without delay in order that action may be taken before the
                            adjournment of the Haytien Congress.<note n="7" xml:id="d358fn4">The
                                President replied in an undated memorandum: “This is, I think,
                                necessary and has my approval. Do you think it will affect Latin

                            The last one is dated yesterday at six p. m.</p>
                        <p>Obregon, whether he intends it or not, is using language to arouse
                            opposition to foreigners, and it is impossible, of course, for anyone to
                            guess what may be the result. We are unfortunate in not having any
                            Special Representative in Mexico City. We have a man, and I believe an
                            excellent one, recommended by Senator Mark Smith, but he took sick on
                            reaching Washington and is now in the hospital. He is the one who was
                            intended for Mexico City and adjoining country.</p>
                        <p>I am wondering whether it may not be necessary to speak more emphatically
                            than we have done. I have used all the adjectives that properly go with
                            persuasion but things seem to grow worse instead of better and the
                            representatives of other nations are very much concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lansing has suggested it might be worth while to notify Carranza and
                            Obregon that in view of the language which is being employed by Obregon
                            to excite hatred of foreigners, thus greatly increasing the risks, and
                            in view of the interruption of traffic and communication by Carranza,
                            thus further increasing the risks, that we would hold Carranza and
                            Obregon personally responsible for injury that resulted from the methods
                            which they are employing.</p>
                        <p>We have no soldiers nearer than Texas and are not in a position to
                            protect Americans and other foreigners from riot, in case Obregon should
                            succeed in stirring up riot—which he promises in advance not to
                            resist—and I am not sure but we may be justified in bringing this
                            pressure to bear upon Carranza.</p>
                        <p>They are proposing to evacuate, but before doing so they may create a
                            condition there which will result in violence. The fact that the people
                            of Mexico City are ready to welcome Zapata, whom they formerly so
                            greatly feared, or Villa, who was also a terror to them, <pb n="529"
                                xml:id="pg_529" facs="0575"/>as a substitute for Carranza and his
                            best general, Obregon—for Obregon seemed to stand highest among those
                            supporting Carranza—this fact contrasts strangely with the predictions
                            and fears expressed by the people of Mexico City before Huerta left.</p>

                            to restore order and stable government in the Republic, and that they

                            the cabinet this morning of the situation at Progreso I have been giving
                            a great deal of serious thought to the questions then raised and have
                            come to this conclusion:</p>
                        <p>I think that we are justified, in all the circumstances, in saying to
                            Carranza that we cannot recognize his right to blockade the port to the
                            exclusion of our commerce; that we just [<hi rend="italic">must?</hi>]
                            beg him to recall his orders to that effect; and that we shall feel
                            constrained, in case he feels he cannot do so, to instruct our naval
                            officers there to prevent any interference with our commerce to and from
                            the port. He should be told, at the same time, that we are doing this in
                            the interest of peace and amity between the two countries and with no
                            wish or intention to interfere with her internal affairs, from which we
                            shall carefully keep our hands off. I hope that your thinking has led
                            you to a similar conclusion.</p>

                            positive action, but I believe it as real a kindness to Carranza as it
                            was to Huerta and I think the Huerta incident furnishes a very strong
                            precedent. While Carranza <hi rend="underline">may</hi> take offense at
                            it, the chances are he will not, and we can assure Villa and Zapata of
                            our purposes, and in case we came in conflict with Carranza we are in a
                            position to restrain the employment of force within the smallest
                            possible limit just as we did at Vera Cruz. At Progreso there would be
                            no reason for landing a force or taking charge of the port. The people
                            of Progreso are against Carranza, while at Vera Cruz Huerta was in
                            possession.</p>

                            Tumulty know by telephone so that he may release it for the afternoon

                        <p>And will you not see that correct copies are sent (they can be sent plain

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am just in receipt of
                            your Mexican statement which you were kind enough to send over. I think
                            the amendments you have made improved it, although, as you remember, it
                            was quite satisfactory to me yesterday with the exception of one
                            word.</p>
                        <p>However, as you ask for suggestions, permit me to inquire whether, on the
                            first page, about one-third of the way down, it would not be wise to
                            substitute the words “its authority denied” instead of “robbed of
                            authority.” This is merely a suggestion intended to avoid use of the
                            word “rob.” It is not, however, a material change.</p>
                        <p>The last sentence I notice you have substituted the words “for other
                            means” for the word “elsewhere” which was under discussion. My object in
                            calling attention to the word “elsewhere” yesterday was that it did not
                            express what I understood to be your intention, namely, to leave
                            yourself free to know what to do. The change which you have made removes
                            the suggestion that you would necessarily turn to other persons than the
                            present leaders in Mexico and to that extent corrects the commitment
                            which might have been understood from the use of the word “elsewhere.”
                            The phrase “look for other means” does not quite express your thought as
                            I understood it although it comes nearer to it than the word
                            “elsewhere,” if I understand your point in view.</p>
                        <p>What I fear is that the papers will attempt to put a construction upon it
                            which will exclude the possibility of recognizing either one of the
                            factions if, upon investigation, you should find it better to recognize
                            one of those factions than to invite the organization of a new faction.
                            It is possible that by the time you are ready to act Carranza might
                            exert an influence that would justify his recognition. It is possible
                            that it might be wise to encourage Angeles if he should show sufficient
                            support.</p>
                        <p>I think the words “to decide what means should be employed” would leave
                            us more latitude than the words “look for other means.” However, this is
                            merely a suggestion as you know your own wishes in the matter. It is
                            merely submitted out of a desire to render you any assistance that I
                            can.</p>
                        <p>I shall ask to have this note sent you at once and you can advise Mr.
                            Tumulty as to the release of the statement. If he will then advise me
                            when it is released, as it is, or with such changes as you may desire, I
                            will have it sent to Mexico City, to Carothers and to Silliman.</p>

                            when you are ready to recognize anyone he thinks it would be wise for
                            the ABC countries to recognize at the same time. In fact, he reminds me
                            that this was contemplated in the agreement at Nicaragua and he has
                            brought it to my attention since. I told him that I thought it would be
                            very nice to have the ABC countries to recognize at the same time, and
                            that it might be advisable also to notify all the other Latin-American
                            countries having representatives in Mexico so that all could act
                            simultaneously, and I know of no reason why the European countries might
                            not be notified also, because the more complete the recognition the
                            stronger the moral force of the government recognized.</p>

                            changes this morning. I showed him the statement and he read it through,
                            stopping on the last sentence to suggest the very change which I had a
                            few moments before mentioned in my letter. He even used exactly the same
                            words, namely, “what means should be employed.” I thought you might be
                            interested to know that his judgment supports the change.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have been feeling,
                            the past twenty-four hours or so, that it was possible we were not using
                            all the influences we might use in Mexico to guide what is taking place
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Would it be possible to find some direct but unofficial channel through
                            which we could convey to General Carranza this impression:</p>
                        <p>That it was within the possibilities that we might recognize him, as
                            things are now apparently shaping themselves,—at any rate that that
                            possibility was not excluded by anything we had yet determined upon,—but
                            that he need not expect us to consider that course seriously unless he
                            went the full length of conciliation and conference with all factions
                            with a view to the accommodation upon which the opinion of the whole
                            world now insists. He cannot in our view afford to insist upon
                            establishing his own dominion unless he first makes a genuine effort to
                            unite all groups and parties.</p>

                            have the foundations laid at once for the course with regard to Mexico
                            which we outlined, or, rather, indicated, very briefly in conversation
                            the other day. Do you not think it would be well to see the A. B. C. men
                            now to ascertain whether they would be willing (that is, whether their
                            governments would be willing) to cooperate with us in advice and
                            political action (recognition and the like) in bringing order out of
                            chaos there?</p>
                        <p>I do not feel particularly cordial to the Chilean administration just now
                            because they have been making . . . difficulties about the general
                            political understandings we have been trying for some months to
                            establish in formal fashion between ourselves and Latin America; but of
                            course it would be a mistake to leave them out in this Mexican
                            business.</p>
                        <p>Our idea was, you remember, to include in the coöperative conference also
                            the three ranking ministers next after them in the Latin American group;
                            but it would be well to sound out the beginning of the alphabet

                            note to me of the 22nd, relative to approaching certain of the
                            representatives of other American States in regard to cooperating with
                            us in advice and political action as to Mexico, I enclose a
                                memorandum,<note n="10" xml:id="d373fn1">Not printed.</note> showing
                            the three Ambassadors and their present addresses and also the three
                            ranking Ministers from other countries (the rank, of course, depends
                            upon the dates of their assuming their posts in Washington).</p>
                        <p>My own impression is that the three Ministers are probably as available
                            as any who could be selected. With Calderon<note n="11" xml:id="d373fn2"

                                >Uruguayan Minister.</note> I have exceptionally intimate relations.
                            Of course, this gives Central America but one representative.<note

                                Minister.</note> I do not know as this is an objection, but if it
                            is, I think that the excuse that length of service in Washington has
                            governed their selection would overcome any objection which might be
                            made, and prevent the criticism of favoritism.</p>
                        <p>It would seem to me that Dr. Naón and Mr. da Gama should be first
                            approached. As you know, I am going to be in New York the night of
                            Monday, the 28th, and I thought I might be able to arrange a meeting
                            with Mr. da Gama there, if it met with your approval. If it does, will
                            you please telegraph me to that effect, in order that I can arrange with
                            the Ambassador to come to New York?</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Mexican situation has
                            been much in my mind and I have been seeking to map out a course of
                            action which will lead to definite results.</p>
                        <p>The condition precedent to any plan is, of course, that the old
                            aristocratic party must not be recognized in a settlement of the present
                            situation and that the restoration of responsible government must come
                            through the revolutionary element now composed of hostile factions.</p>
                        <p>The problem is, therefore, the harmonizing of the factions representing
                            the Revolution.</p>
                        <p>The present activities in this country of the reactionary Mexican
                            element, manifested by the intrigues along the border, have and will
                            have, I believe, a decided influence on the tendency of the
                            revolutionists to unite and will induce them to listen more favorably to
                            a plan of compromise, and this influence will be stronger if the
                            reactionaries obtain a foothold in Mexico. However this influence will
                            be more potent in the North than in the South which is not immediately
                            affected by the reactionary movement. This difficulty is further
                            increased by the character of General Carranza and the present successes
                            of his military forces.</p>
                        <p>As you know the suggestion has undoubtedly by this time been made to
                            Carranza that he invite the various revolutionary factions to meet in
                            conference, discuss their differences and seek to compose them, each
                            faction in such conference to be represented by only <hi
                                rend="underline">one</hi> conferee. The idea of the conference is to
                            be consultative and in no sense conventional, thus eliminating any
                            question of majority rule.</p>
                        <p>If Carranza adopts this suggestion and invites the other factions to
                            confer, an armistice might be proposed during the progress of the
                            conference, for I am convinced that the factions will accept the
                            invitation.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of the conditions prevailing in the South and the
                            probable success of the Carranzista arms, together with the stubbornness
                            of Carranza himself, I have little hope that he will adopt the
                            suggestion for a conference or agree to an armistice. I think,
                            therefore, we should plan to act on the supposition that a conference of
                            the revolutionary factions will not take place.</p>
                        <p>On this supposition I would suggest that the attitude of this Government
                            be embodied in the following propositions: <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539"

                                    accomplished through them to restore peace and stable

                                    bulk of the revolutionary element, this Government and the other
                                    governments cooperating with it, will recognize it and renew
                                    diplomatic relations with Mexico.</item>

                                    may properly employ to insure the stability and permanency of
                                    such government until constitutional government can be

                            representatives of the several factions so far as they are represented
                            in this country, establish confidential relations with them, if

                        <p>The suggestion as to engaging a person to keep in touch with
                            representatives of Mexican factions here seems to me very wise and Mr.
                            Fuller to be the best fitted. I will, if you desire, ask him to come and
                            see me, although I think a communication from you would be more
                            effective in view of the fact that he would be your personal agent in
                            the matter. I assume from your note of the 7th that you had not then
                            received my letter suggesting a course of action in Mexico. I have seen
                            the six diplomats who are communicating with their governments in regard
                            to informal conversations. They all seemed to be personally gratified at
                            the proposed identical action and believed that their governments would
                            readily authorize them to confer.</p>

                            us admirably in the way I indicated, not only, but also in preparing the
                            way, cautiously and tactfully, for what we intend to do. I would be very
                            much obliged if you would ask him if he can do us this great additional
                            service, saying that you do so at my request and advice, as well as on
                            your own judgment.</p>
                        <p>The suggestions contained in your letter of the fifth furnish an
                            excellent foundation, it seems to me, for planning something definite
                            and final in the Mexican matter, and run very nearly along the lines of
                            my own thought. I would like you to consider the following:</p>
                        <p>What did Angeles and Bonilla have in mind? I suppose they are still in
                            Washington, or near at hand; and it seems to me that, directly or
                            indirectly, we ought to know everything that is in their mind,
                            especially now that the Huerta cloud has again appeared on the
                            horizon.</p>
                        <p>Do you know whether Iturbide really represents anything substantial? Is
                            it possible that he is in any way in cooperation with the scoundrel,
                            Huerta?</p>
                        <p>Is there not reason to fear that without the present factional leaders,
                            who seem to represent the strongest that has been thrown to the surface,
                            we would be in a wallow of weaknesses and jealousies down <pb n="541"
                                xml:id="pg_541" facs="0587"/>there, unless some man (perhaps
                            Angeles) could be commended by our confidence to the trust of the
                            rest?</p>
                        <p>Should not the conference proposed in case Carranza does not act (as
                            seems to me certain) be proposed by the A. B. C. group and their
                            associates, and should not they and their associates in some way preside
                            and direct at that conference?</p>
                        <p>We must be careful not to act in a way which will wound sensibilities.
                            Villa has again and again offered to eliminate himself, and if it should
                            come to our requesting all the present leaders to withdraw in order to
                            effect a satisfactory settlement, these repeated offers should be made
                            the most of and the leaders of the other factions challenged to follow
                            his example. We must play these men as they are.</p>
                        <p>After the six diplomats we have sounded hear from their governments
                            (assuming, as I think we may, that they will hear favourably) I think
                            their advice will probably be of a good deal of service to us in
                            determining just how to approach the men we shall have to deal with in
                            the way that will be most likely to appeal to them . . .</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to have the benefit of memoranda on all or any of these
                            matters, and thank you sincerely for the thought you are giving this
                            perplexing matter.</p>

                            other than the action already taken. It is very possible when it becomes

                            regard to Mexico that the Mexican authorities will make a more earnest

                            to Mexico. There was manifested unanimous feeling of gratification that
                            this informal conference had been called, as indicating the attitude of
                            the Government toward Pan-Americanism. We <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543"

                            that a definite and practical plan will result. Of course I shall agree

                            preliminary discussion, I can see no reason for your immediate return to
                            Washington. I will telegraph you if I should think it necessary or
                            essential that you should be here.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I did not write you of
                            the conference yesterday on Mexico as the session today was in
                            continuance. Yesterday’s session lasted two hours; today’s three
                            hours.</p>
                        <p>All the conferees were enthusiastic over the meeting, primarily on
                            account of the evidence of the Administration’s friendliness to the
                            Pan-American idea. Should it fail in every other way, it has already
                            done much to draw Latin-America near to us.</p>
                        <p>I explained fully at the opening of the first session that the conference
                            was informal and advisory and that there was no purpose of joint action,
                            but that it might result in identical action which would, however, be
                            independent. I said that this Government had no intention to invade the
                            sovereignty of Mexico but merely to aid the Mexican people in the
                            present distressing condition by seeking to recognize a government which
                            would restore peace, secure individual rights, and perform its
                            international obligations; that we recognized the right of revolution
                            against injustice and tyranny; that we recognized that the principle of
                            the revolution, the restoration of constitutional government, had
                            triumphed a year ago; that the factions of the revolutionists, which
                            were now quarreling, were joint possessors of the sovereignty; that
                            personal ambition and personal greed were the causes of the factions;
                            that no one faction represented the revolution, but that all of them
                            combined did represent it; and that, therefore, we must seek for a new
                            government among the factions and see if their differences could not be
                            adjusted at least sufficiently to have the greater part unite on a
                            provisional government strong enough and honest enough to command
                            respect at home and abroad and to obtain recognition.</p>
                        <p>To the foregoing statement all the conferees gave assent, and we
                            proceeded to discuss the means to accomplish the end sought.</p>
                        <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0590"/>
                        <p>. . . the first session decided upon two definite steps: First, to send a
                            communication to the factions inviting them to an immediate conference,
                            the communication to be signed by all the conferees independently and
                            severally, not jointly: Second, to work out at once a plan of selecting
                            a government to be recognized by the countries represented in case the
                            first step failed.</p>
                        <p>At the session today Mr. Suárez submitted a draft communication in
                            Spanish to be sent to the factions, which he prepared at my request.
                            After some correction and considerable discussion it was approved by
                            all. I stated to the conference that before I could act, the plan and
                            communication must be submitted to you. I, therefore, enclose a
                            translation for your consideration.<note n="13" xml:id="d384fn1">For the
                                communication as sent, see <ref target="frus1915#pg_735">

                        </p>
                        <p>After a general expression of views, which again wandered into the field
                            of abstraction, I suggested that a committee of three, Mr. Naón, Mr.
                            Calderón, and Mr. Fuller, prepare the details of the course to be taken
                            in case the first step failed. This seemed the only way of practical
                            suggestion. I enclose a written declaration prepared by Mr. Naón which
                            was approved by all. The report will be supplemental to the latter part
                            of this declaration.</p>
                        <p>I believe the committee are to work upon it tonight and it will be
                            presented to the conference, which is to meet in New York on Tuesday or
                            Wednesday. The change of the place of meeting was at the request of the
                            conferees and was due to the heat here.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In the discussions I found that there was unanimous agreement that
                            Carranza was impossible, that even if he triumphed it would mean
                            continued disorder. The disposition was to eliminate from consideration
                            as the head of a government to be recognized all the present heads of
                            factions and to seek a man who would draw the secondary chiefs to him.
                            It was felt too that the man to establish the government must be named
                            to us by Mexicans and, if possible, should be one with a measure of
                            constitutional right. All were impressed with the necessity of haste on
                            account of the distress in Mexico. . . .</p>
                        <p>I would be gratified if you would telegraph your approval of the Suárez
                            communication to the factions, if you do approve, so I can notify the
                            conferees and also call the meeting in New York to consider the
                            committee’s report on the second step.</p>
                        <p>I forgot to say that it is intended to send the communication not only to
                            the heads of the factions but to the principal military and political
                            chiefs as well.</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0591"/>
                        <p>Secretary McAdoo telegraphed me asking me to meet him in New York on
                            Sunday, the 8th, as you desired us to confer. I shall, therefore, be at
                            The Biltmore Sunday morning.</p>

                                chaotic conditions in Mexico. The acquiescence on your part to this
                                plan enabling the operation of the Juarez Packing Plant, even though
                                it be but a temporary arrangement, will remove the greatest obstacle
                                confronting the Department of State in reaching the results so much
                                desired by the President. The military decree mentioned is the only
                                form of law existing in Mexico today, and is identical to the
                                decrees issued in the Philippines, Porto Rico, and Cuba, during the
                                military occupations of those countries, and which were recognized
                                by this Government.”</p>

                        <p>The situation in northern Mexico caused by the desperation of Villa to
                            maintain himself financially has resulted in arbitrary demands by him,
                            and the solution offered in the message above quoted will give Villa
                            legal means to dispose of cattle he has in the vicinity of Juarez, and
                            will offer immediate relief to his strained financial condition. Would
                            it not be well for you to communicate with Secretary Houston?</p>

                            a little. Do you think it wise to put Villa in the way of getting money
                            just at the moment when he is apparently weakest and on the verge of
                            collapse? What will be gained by that, if, should he be left alone, he
                            may be eliminated by the force of events?</p>
                        <p>Reading some of the flimsy that came to-day leads me to ask, also, Are
                            you sure that he has in fact been doing all the lawless things he is
                            accused of having done? Does he not seem to have paid for what he
                            seized?</p>

                            telegram of the 6th in regard to the effect of Villa’s arbitrary actions
                            upon the work of the conference. The importance of it seems to be that
                            as the preliminary <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0593"/>step was to
                            secure a compromise between factions, it would very much embarrass that
                            plan if Villa should prove himself to be unworthy of consideration by
                            his continued acts of aggression against foreigners.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, however, the situation is much clearer this morning. A
                            despatch from Carothers<note n="14" xml:id="d388fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            states that Villa will remain at El Paso until he has had an interview
                            with General Scott and that the meeting of miners, which he had summoned
                            at Chihuahua, would be postponed until after such interview. Secretary
                            Houston has also consented to the establishment under military decree of
                            cattle inspection upon the border. This will relieve, to a considerable
                            measure, I believe, Villa’s desperate financial situation which has
                            induced his arbitrary conduct.</p>

                            this point be dwelt upon: the first and most essential step in settling
                            affairs of Mexico is not to call general elections. It seems to me
                            necessary that a provisional government essentially revolutionary in
                            character should take action to institute reforms by decree before the
                            full forms of the constitution are resumed. This was the original
                            program of the revolution and seems to me probably an essential part of
                            it.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I received your letter
                            commenting upon the telegram which I sent you on August 6th in regard to
                            the exportation of cattle from northern Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0594"/>
                        <p>The reason for furnishing Villa with an opportunity to obtain funds is
                            this: We do not wish the Carranza faction to be the only one to deal
                            with in Mexico. Carranza seems so impossible that an appearance, at
                            least, of opposition to him will give us an opportunity to invite a
                            compromise of factions. I think, therefore, it is politic, for the time,
                            to allow Villa to obtain sufficient financial resources to allow his
                            faction to remain in arms until a compromise can be effected.</p>
                        <p>Much of our information in regard to the conduct of Villa comes from
                            reliable and more or less friendly sources. I believe he is desperate on
                            account of lack of money, but we will know much more about that after
                            General Scott has had his interview with him today. So far as payments
                            made by him for seized property are concerned, it must be borne in mind
                            that these payments are in Villista money, which is worth, I am
                            informed, about two cents Mexican for a peso, which is, by decree,
                            declared to be worth sixty cents Mexican—that is, while Villa makes a
                            pretense of paying, he is doing so in currency which is practically
                            worthless.</p>

                            reached.</p>
                        <p>Necessarily the report is more or less fragmentary on account of the
                            informal nature of the conference; separate conversations going on at
                            the same time, and some of them in Spanish, prevented a full and
                            accurate report.</p>
                        <p>I endeavored, at the outset, to clear away as far as possible the
                            discussion of principles and abstractions, in order that we could get
                            down to the practical points to be discussed.</p>
                        <p>I also enclose a printed copy of the communication to be sent to the
                            chiefs of the factions.<note n="17" xml:id="d391fn2">For the

                        <p>I think it would be unwise for the conference to take for granted or
                            insist upon the elimination of Carranza. It would be to ignore some very
                            big facts. It seems to me very important that the plan now formed should
                            leave the way of action open in any direction and not assume a beginning
                            over again with a clean sheet of paper to write on. Carranza will
                            somehow have to be digested into the scheme and, above all, the object
                            of the revolution will have to be in any event conserved.</p>

                            dated yesterday, from Mr. Canova,<note n="19" xml:id="d393fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> in response to an oral request for information in
                            regard to the shipment of arms and ammunition to Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I think you will find the facts of extreme interest. I, myself, had no
                            idea that any such quantity of war munitions was going to the different
                            Mexican factions.</p>
                        <p>It has suggested itself to me that it might be good policy at the present
                            time to place a general embargo on arms and ammunition exported to
                            Mexico, on the theory that after the sending of the appeal to the
                            leaders, which was adopted in the recent conference, and until this
                            peaceful method of settling their differences had been tried, an
                            armistice between the warring factions could be enforced by such an
                            embargo. I am not at all convinced that this would be a wise course, but
                            I think it worthy of consideration. If the situation on the border
                            becomes more critical it would be very unfortunate to allow arms and
                            ammunition to go to any of the factions in control of the border towns,
                            because they would be used against our own forces in case of a
                            clash.</p>

                            to be unwise since he fails to seize an opportunity which would give him
                            exceptional advantage, and especially so in view of the desperate
                            situation of the Villistas, who seem to be entirely disorganized and
                            incapable of offering united resistance to the advancing Carranzista
                            army.</p>
                        <p>Of course his invitation to meet in conference on the border to discuss
                            Mexican affairs from the international standpoint with the sole object
                            of determining whether the government, of which he is the head, is
                            entitled to recognition as a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> government
                            cannot be accepted. The place of a meeting for such purpose could not in
                            any event be Mexican territory. If Carranza had named Washington it
                            might be at least worthy of consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0597"/>
                        <p>The proposal, however, shows a better disposition, it seems to me, than
                            any previous action by Carranza. He says that he is willing to discuss
                            the facts on which must be determined whether or not his government
                            should be recognized. That necessarily involves the questions of its
                            ability to restore peace, its stability, and its international
                            responsibility. As a result such a conference would in fact review the
                            entire domestic state of Mexico including the power of the factions and
                            their complaints against one another.</p>
                        <p>The Carranzistas are undoubtedly stronger and more cohesive than they
                            have ever been. In fact I have almost reached the conclusion that they
                            are so dominant that they are entitled to recognition. If they are not
                            recognized, I cannot see what will be gained by recognizing any other
                            government, since the present war would continue and be prolonged by
                            strengthening the opposition to Carranza, who, I feel certain, would win
                            in the end.</p>
                        <p>The situation has changed materially since the communication was sent to
                            the Mexican chiefs. Villa’s power has rapidly waned, his forces have
                            disintegrated, and many of his ablest lieutenants have abandoned him or
                            are quarreling with him. As long as the Villista faction was capable of
                            offering stubborn resistance to the Constitutionalists the desirable
                            thing was to stay the strife by harmonizing the factional differences.
                            That was the purpose of the proposed conference of leaders. Now, it
                            seems to me, the problem is whether or not peace in Mexico will not be
                            more quickly restored by giving moral support to the triumphing faction
                            of Carranza.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty we are in is that we proposed a conference of Mexicans to
                            determine a course of action. The weaker factions other than the
                            Carranzistas have accepted the invitation. Can we consistently or
                            honorably refuse to call such a conference? If we do call it, what will
                            be the practical value of its deliberations? With the utter
                            demoralization of the enemies of Carranza it would be absurd to assert
                            that any government, which they could set up, represented the
                            sovereignty of the Mexican people.</p>
                        <p>The conference might meet, however, to formulate the grievances, which
                            the participants have against Carranza and which could be laid before
                            him. Of course such a course would entirely change the purpose of the
                            conference, but then conditions have materially changed in favor of
                            Carranza.</p>
                        <p>I think, in any event, it is necessary to call the Ambassadors and
                            Ministers together and lay before them the replies of the Mexican chiefs
                            and also the present state of affairs in Mexico and the continuing
                            successes of the Carranzista arms. But before doing this I would like to
                            be prepared to present a course of action for consideration which would
                            be practical and expedient in the circumstances.</p>
                        <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0598"/>
                        <p>As this involves the whole general Mexican policy I think that I should
                            be advised as to your wishes in the matter.</p>

                            over this matter orally; but perhaps it is best for me to put down what
                            I understand our course of action is to be:</p>
                        <p>We are to call our Latin American colleagues together and suggest to them
                            a conference with representatives of Carranza at Washington, on
                            substantially the basis he proposes, to discuss the advisability of
                            recognizing him as the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> head of the
                            Republic; having it clearly understood that we think the acceptance of
                            the Revolution absolutely necessary.</p>
                        <p>We are also to keep faith with the leaders of the other factions, who
                            have accepted our proposal for a conference on Mexican affairs, and are
                            to call such a conference of their representatives to be convened and
                            held in Mexico; with the understanding that we wish from them any
                            proposals they may wish to make, but with the intimation conveyed to
                            them in some proper way that the best and most helpful thing for them to
                            do is to let us know confidentially the terms upon which they will
                            submit to Carranza in view of the probable necessity we shall be under,
                            because of the utter alteration of conditions since our suggestion of a
                            conference was conveyed to them, of recognizing him as the head of the
                            Republic.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: We have just finished
                            the Mexican Conference, and I am sorry to say that we failed to carry
                            out in full the program embodied in the Argentine Ambassador’s
                            Resolution which I sent to you.<note n="23" xml:id="d398fn1">See extract
                                from the proceedings of the conference of diplomatic
                                representatives, <ref target="#pg_545">p. 545</ref>.</note> The
                            failure was due to the Brazilian Ambassador who is apparently opposed to
                            all the revolutionary factions in Mexico <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553"
                                facs="0599"/>to the extent that he is unwilling to be in any way
                            responsible for the recognition of any of them. I believe, however, that
                            in case this Government determines to recognize a <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> government in Mexico he will advise his Government to
                            follow our course.</p>
                        <p>The split came over notifying the representatives of the factions to meet
                            us separately in conference. The Argentine Ambassador and the Ministers
                            from Bolivia and Uruguay supported strongly the proposal. The Chilean
                            Ambassador was not in entire accord but I believe would have submitted
                            if da Gama had agreed. The Guatemalan, though he said nothing, was
                            evidently favorable.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence, we got no further than to agree to recommend to our
                            respective Governments the recognition of a <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> Government in Mexico as soon as possible. I enclose for
                            your information, copy of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>It was further understood that independently we should collect all the
                            evidence we could as to the facts showing which Government in Mexico, on
                            account of stability, was able to give adequate guarantees to perform
                            its international obligations. It was recognized there were various
                            sources of information as to these facts. I expressed the view that I
                            thought the two principal factions should have the opportunity to
                            present by personal representatives the reasons why one should be
                            recognized over the other, and that I thought it might be well for me to
                            invite the Chiefs of these factions to send such representatives to
                            Washington, before our next conference in order that I might have an
                            interview with them and with any other members of the Conference who
                            desired to participate.</p>
                        <p>Since the Conference adjourned I have been thinking it might possibly be
                            better to orally communicate with the representatives of the two
                            factions already in this country, and ask them for an interview of this
                            sort. In this way we would not get into difficulties which might arise
                            if we formally addressed either Carranza or Villa. I told the Conference
                            that I should have to submit the question of such interviews to you for
                            your approval before I took such a step. If you approve the latter of
                            these plans of obtaining the facts as to the situation in Mexico, I
                            would suggest that Mr. Polk ask Arredondo and Llorente to come and see
                            him, and to tell them that I desire to see them in about two weeks, in
                            order that they could present their case for recognition to me orally
                            and in writing. In case the more formal method is adopted, I think
                            telegrams should be sent to the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Carranza and Villa, asking them to send
                            delegates to meet me at the time I suggest. Meanwhile, I think we should
                            telegraph our various Consuls in Mexico as to the exact situation in
                            their localities.</p>
                        <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0600"/>
                        <p>I am disappointed, naturally, that the plan that we had agreed upon was
                            not carried through, but as it has failed, to an extent, I think we
                            should follow out some such scheme as the one above proposed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Arredondo called to ask in regard to the reports of the attack upon
                            Columbus, New Mexico by Villista troops. I read to him the despatches
                            from Cobb and Carothers, sent today.<note n="24" xml:id="d399fn1">

                                For correspondence previously printed concerning the attack on
                                Columbus, N. Mex., see <ref target="frus1916#pg_480">

                            thought the attack was made in accordance with a definite plan on the
                            part of Villa to compel this Government to invade Mexico, and that I
                            sincerely hoped he would advise his Government to raise no objection to
                            the pursuit by American troops into Mexico of the attacking forces; that
                            it was beyond human endurance to be attacked in the way the American
                            troops had been attacked and when they attempted to revenge the death of
                            their comrades to be stopped at the border; that I thought the case of
                            “hot pursuit” by a punitive expedition was a very different thing from
                            the deliberate invasion by an expeditionary force with intent to occupy
                            Mexican territory.</p>
                        <p>Arredondo replied that he considered this to be a just conclusion and
                            that he would at once advise General Carranza of this view and express
                            to him the hope that he would raise no objection in case it was proven
                            true that the American troops had entered Mexico.</p>
                        <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0601"/>
                        <p>I said to him that if there should be objection raised and serious
                            trouble should result, his Government would be playing directly into the
                            hands of Villa and would do the very thing that Villa wished them to do.
                            He replied—“I know that is so and I will do what I can to avoid any
                            trouble of this sort.”</p>
                        <p>I told Arredondo that we had already telegraphed to Mr. Silliman<note

                            facts but that I was not sure yet whether troops had actually crossed
                            the border, although I believed that they had done so; that we did not
                            seek the consent or cooperation of the Mexican Government as we felt it
                            would cause resentment against Carranza and make the political situation
                            most difficult.</p>

                        <p>After some hesitation he said these two recent communications covering
                            the proposed agreement was their reply.<note n="27" xml:id="d400fn2"

                            that this proposed agreement would cover future movements of troops and
                            as to the present expedition, we would do everything we could to conform
                            in general to the terms suggested by him. His reply was that the
                            proposed terms were meant to cover this particular expedition and his
                            suggestion was that the agreement should be made at once and that we
                            could then slowly withdraw our troops so as to meet all the terms,—that
                            is to say, that there should not be more than one thousand troops over
                            the border and that they should not go more than sixty kilometers from
                            the border into Mexico. I told him that this would be difficult, if not
                            impossible, for obvious reasons. His point is that the chances of
                            catching Villa are slight; that our troops may have to venture a great
                            distance into Mexico; that Villa will hide in the mountains, and it will
                            mean a campaign of months in the heart of Mexico. All this will be very
                            dangerous <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0602"/>to existing friendly
                            relations. He thought that our troops could not [<hi rend="italic"
                                >now?</hi>] be secretly withdrawn and the statement then made that
                            Villa had fled into the interior of Mexico. I told him he could tell
                            General Carranza that this Government was most anxious to meet his views
                            in every way possible; that the arrangement proposed would probably be
                            satisfactory to cover all future campaigns, but as to this particular
                            campaign I felt sure that you would wish to have reports showing the
                            progress of this campaign and the chances of success before you could
                            consider reducing the force in Mexico and withdrawing it to the limits
                            suggested. I told him that I would communicate with you and I knew that
                            you would give the matter very careful attention. He said that General
                            Carranza was very anxious for a prompt reply and I told him that we
                            would try to meet his wishes in this connection.</p>
                        <p>In leaving he again assured me that General Carranza was anxious to do
                            everything he could to maintain friendly relations. This is where the
                            matter now stands.</p>

                            received your approval as to substance. It was my idea after you had
                            made such changes as you desire to submit it to him for the purpose of
                            any corrections which might be necessary.</p>

                            an increasing probability that the Mexican situation may develop into a
                            state of war I desire to make a suggestion for your consideration.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that we should avoid the use of the word “Intervention”
                            and deny that any invasion of Mexico is for the sake of
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>There are several reasons why this appears to me expedient:<list>
                                <label>First.</label>
                                <item>We have all along denied any purpose to interfere in the
                                    internal affairs of Mexico and the St. Louis platform declares
                                    against it. Intervention conveys the idea of such
                                    interference.</item>
                                <label>Second.</label>
                                <item>Intervention would be humiliating to many Mexicans whose pride
                                    and sense of national honor would not resent severe terms of
                                    peace in case of being defeated in a war.</item>
                                <label>Third.</label>
                                <item>American intervention in Mexico is extremely distasteful to
                                    all Latin America and might have a very bad effect upon our
                                    Pan-American program.</item>
                                <label>Fourth.</label>
                                <item>Intervention, which suggests a definite purpose to “clean up”
                                    the country, would bind us to certain accomplishments which
                                    circumstances might make extremely difficult or inadvisable,
                                    and, on the other hand, it would impose conditions which might
                                    be found to be serious restraints upon us as the situation
                                    develops.</item>
                                <label>Fifth.</label>
                                <item>Intervention also implies that the war would be made primarily
                                    in the interest of the Mexican people, while the fact is it
                                    would <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0605"/>be a war forced
                                    on us by the Mexican Government, and, if we term it
                                    intervention, we will have considerable difficulty in explaining
                                    why we had not intervened before but waited until
                                    attacked.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the real attitude is that the <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> Government having attacked our forces engaged in a

                            to prevent future attacks by forcing the Mexican Government to perform
                            its obligations. That is, it is simply a state of international war
                            without purpose on our part other than to end the conditions which
                            menace our national peace and the safety of our citizens, and that it is
                                <hi rend="underline">not</hi> intervention with all that that word
                            implies.</p>
                        <p>I offer the foregoing suggestion, because I feel that we should have
                            constantly in view the attitude we intend to take if worse comes to
                            worse, so that we may regulate our present policy and future
                            correspondence with Mexico and other American Republics with that
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>In case this suggestion meets with your approval I further suggest that
                            we send to each diplomatic representative of a Latin American Republic
                            in Washington a communication stating briefly our attitude and denying
                            any intention to intervene. I enclose a draft of such a note.<note

                            is to be done at all, it seems to me that it should be done at once,
                            otherwise we will lose the chief benefit, namely, a right understanding
                            by Latin America at the very outset.</p>

                            I was myself about to say something to you to the same effect, though I
                            had not thought of making an occasion of the sending of copies of our
                            note to Mexico to the Latin American representatives, but had thought to
                            wait until hostilities were actually forced upon us. As I write this
                            “extras” of the evening paper are being cried on the Avenue which, if
                            true, mean that hostilities <hi rend="underline">have</hi> begun. At any
                            rate, my doubt upon that point (the time for the notification you
                            suggest) is so slight that I beg that you will carry out the plan you
                            suggest at once.</p>

                        <p>The announced policy of the United States in its relations with Mexico
                            has been and still is one of non-intervention. In using the words
                            “intervention” and “non-intervention” the meaning of intervention should
                            be clearly understood. To intervene in the affairs of a neighboring
                            independent state means to interfere with its domestic affairs and the
                            exercise of its sovereign rights by its people.</p>
                        <p>In June, 1915, when I became Secretary of State, I realized that the
                            continued conditions of lawlessness and violence in the northern states
                            of Mexico might at any time compel us to employ force to protect the
                            American border and American citizens against the bands of armed men who
                            were committing depredations in that region, and that, if we were
                            compelled to send troops into Mexico, it could only be construed as
                            intervention between the factions which were striving to obtain control
                            of the government. Without a recognized government we could not cause a
                            state of international war between the United States and Mexico.</p>
                        <p>In view of the policy of non-intervention and the satisfaction with which
                            it had been received by the Latin American Republics to be forced to
                            adopt a course of intervention although the actual purpose was
                            protection of American rights and territory would have placed the
                            Government in an awkward position. It would have been difficult to
                            persuade the Latin American governments that we could only intervene in
                            view of the fact that Mexico had no government which we could hold
                            responsible for the crimes perpetrated. Suspicion and doubt would have
                            been aroused as to our motives and we would have been charged with
                            insincerity in announcing that we had no intention to intervene. This
                            would have been very unfortunate for our efforts to secure a Pan
                            American treaty, and would have materially affected the policy of Pan
                            Americanism, which was being developed.</p>
                        <p>It was important, therefore, to recognize a government in Mexico as soon
                            as opportunity offered in order to avoid a condition which forced us
                            into the false position of intervention.</p>

                            this morning for a memorandum on the policy to be adopted in regard to

                            I think may be worked out in a new way.</p>
                        <p>The idea is simply the naming of a joint American-Mexican Commission of
                            four or six members to study the various questions relating to the
                            boundary troubles and the necessary means to prevent them in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>If the Carrizal incident was a clear case of Mexican aggression I doubt
                            if I would be favorable to this policy, but it appears to me that
                            Captain Boyd was possibly to blame.<note n="37" xml:id="d407fn1">For

                            action.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the creation and work of a joint commission I would offer

                            will be by the time the Commission completes its work.<note n="39"

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: Ambassador Naón called
                            to see me yesterday afternoon by appointment to discuss a plan which he
                            has to visit Mexico and explain personally to General Carranza his views
                            as to the friendly and unselfish attitude of this Government toward
                            Mexico. He thinks that he can remove the suspicions of our motives,
                            which he considers the stumbling block to a full and frank understanding
                            being reached between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>He would go to Mexico entirely on his own motion, carefully avoiding any
                            intimation that he had consulted me before leaving. He will be careful
                            to explain that he is in no sense acting as a mediator or intermediary
                            (the fact is he does not approve mediation), and has only made the
                            journey because of his sincere friendship for Mexico and his feeling
                            that the spirit and purposes of the United States are misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that I would talk the matter over with you and give
                            him a definite answer later, but that I could not see any objection to
                            his visiting Mexico as long as he did so without the sanction of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador came from New York on purpose to lay this matter before me
                            and returned yesterday afternoon. I shall be in <pb n="563"
                                xml:id="pg_563" facs="0609"/>New York on my way to Henderson Harbor
                            for several hours Friday evening and could arrange to see him then and
                            give him a definite answer.</p>
                        <p>In case we decide to adopt the plan of seeking the appointment of a Joint
                            Commission what would you think of the idea of explaining it to Naón and
                            having him, if opportunity offers, urge the acceptance of the plan by
                            Carranza in case he goes to Mexico?</p>

                            in the papers the progress which has been made in the American-Mexican
                            Joint Commission.<note n="40" xml:id="d409fn1">See report of the

                            intended to write you before about the matter but in view of the absence
                            of Polk and Phillips the routine work of the Department has occupied
                            much more of my time than has been customary.</p>
                        <p>At the luncheon which I gave to the Commissioners at the Biltmore
                            yesterday I was especially gratified at the tone of the remarks made by
                            Mr. Arredondo and Mr. Cabrera. They indicated very clearly the desire of
                            the Mexican Government to adjust not only the boundary difficulty but
                            all other controversies which have arisen between the United States and
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I might say to you, very confidentially, that Rodgers, who has been
                            representing us in Mexico City and who accompanied the Mexican
                            Commissioners when they came to this country and who is now with our
                            Commissioners at New London, informed me that Cabrera had told him that
                            they were willing to go into every question which the American
                            Commissioners thought important, provided publicity could be avoided, as
                            he was fearful that it would cause political trouble in Mexico. He also
                            said that General Carranza had indicated to him the same thing, and
                            looked forward with confidence that all matters could be successfully
                            adjusted.</p>
                        <p>Taking everything into consideration I think the prospects are bright for
                            a definite settlement of the Mexican situation although it will take
                            some time to work out the details. Of course from the very outset—that
                            is, from the time we recognized Carranza—peace, the restoration of
                            order, and the renewal of industrial activity in Mexico <pb n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564" facs="0610"/>has been practically a financial
                            problem. It is that, particularly, which I hope to see solved.</p>
                        <p>Now that the weather is becoming cooler I presume you are thinking of
                            returning to New York so that it will be possible for me to see you at
                            no distant date. I have many things I would like to talk with you about,
                            but at present cannot write them.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Rumors have reached
                                me from a number of different quarters that influences are at work
                                from this side of the border to bring about from the Mexican side
                                another raid into the territory of the United States by the
                                irregular Mexican forces. These rumors may be ill-founded, but they
                                are so persistent and definite that I do not feel it would be right
                                to ignore them.</p>
                            <p>I, therefore, write to request you to apprise General Funston of
                                these rumors and to instruct him to be unusually on the alert that
                                every source of information may be taken advantage of and every
                                precaution adopted that is possible in the circumstances, in order
                                that every vulnerable point of the border where American property or
                                lives are exposed may be safeguarded to the utmost.</p>

                            the 26th enclosing one to Secretary Baker, which I had already seen.</p>
                        <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon I received a telegram from Secretary Lane, a copy of
                            which I understand has been mailed to you.<note n="41" xml:id="d411fn1"
                                >Not printed.</note> I at once showed it to Baker and we agreed that
                            publicity would have the double effect of deterring the plotters from
                            pursuing their purpose and of preventing hostile sentiment to you
                            politically in case an attempt was made to carry out the plan. After
                            dictating a statement for the press Baker left for West Virginia. I
                            modified the statement to a certain extent and it was then given
                            out.</p>
                        <p>In the evening I found that the opposition papers were intending to
                            declare that the statement was made for political purposes and, in the
                            absence of Baker, I felt it necessary to give out the comment to the
                            Associated Press, which was printed this morning, (a copy is
                                enclosed<note n="41" xml:id="d411fn2">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>This morning Secretary Baker and I conferred on the subject and agreed to
                            emphasize the fact that it was Mexican refugees in this country whom we
                            suspected, that they were naturally hostile to the present
                            administration and desired your defeat and would go any length to
                            accomplish that end, and that it was unthinkable that any American could
                            be so unpatriotic and heartless as to participate in a plot for
                            political purposes, which if carried out would result in the loss of
                            American lives.</p>
                        <p>This in brief is the situation and I am thoroughly convinced that it was
                            the wise thing to do.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: On May 1st General
                            Carranza will be inaugurated as President of Mexico. The question arises
                            whether Fletcher’s presence at the ceremony will be a recognition of the
                                <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> character of the Government and an
                            acceptance of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a memorandum on the subject which recites in a general way
                            the salient features of the situation.<note n="42" xml:id="d412fn1"

                        </p>
                        <p>It would seem as if it were advisable as a matter of policy that Fletcher
                            should attend the inaugural ceremonies for we ought to do everything
                            possible to avoid any action which can be seized upon as a pretext by
                            the Mexicans for complaint.</p>

                                formal letter to the heads of nations (file No. 123 F
                                63/152).</note> a reply can be drafted making the proper
                            reservations as to American vested rights affected by the new
                            Constitution. I enclose a form of reservation which might be
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>As to whether Fletcher’s presence would be a formal recognition of the
                                <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> character of the Government, I think
                            that the words <hi rend="italic">“de facto”</hi> may be employed before
                            and after the inauguration in such a way as to indicate that we consider
                            the character of the Government has not changed by the ceremony of
                            inauguration but only the title of the head of the Government who will
                            be “the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> President” instead of “The Chief
                            of the Constitutionalist Army.”</p>
                        <p>Of course the advantage to be gained in preserving the <hi rend="italic"
                                >de facto</hi> status is that the obligation to obey any mandate
                            relating to neutrality issued by such a Government is far less than if
                            it is <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>. Against an obligation of that sort
                            we should endeavor to guard ourselves as far as possible. Furthermore it
                            would be consistent with the reservation of rights improperly impaired
                            by the new Constitution.</p>
                        <p>As the time is very short will you please give me your views on this
                            important matter as soon as possible so that I may telegraph
                            instructions to Fletcher?<note n="47" xml:id="d412fn3">For the

                            the inauguration of President-elect Carranza.</p>
                        <p>In felicitating General Carranza, you will be careful to say or do
                            nothing that would indicate a recognition of his government as <hi

                        <p>Everything should be done to hold the confidence and friendship of
                            Carranza at this time. Although it may be impossible to accept those
                            provisions of the new constitution which are in contravention of the
                            international obligations of Mexico, it is desired for reasons of high
                            policy not to force an issue on these questions. They will be met when
                            they arise.</p>
                        <p>The Department relies upon your every effort to prevent matters of vital
                            military importance coming to a head, in particular as regards the

                            that you are to see Senators Hitchcock and Fall this afternoon in regard
                            to the Mexican situation. I have not troubled you with the Jenkins case
                            which is of considerable complexity as to facts and as to law because
                            there was no possibility of that case developing a situation which could
                            possibly warrant intervention in Mexico.<note n="50" xml:id="d414fn1"

                            that the Foreign Relations Committee is in entire accord.</p>
                        <p>The real Mexican situation is the whole series of outrages and wrongs
                            which Americans in Mexico have suffered during the Carranza
                            administration. There is no doubt that the complaints are numerous and
                            justified and that the indictment which can be drawn against Carranza
                            will appeal very strongly to the people and arouse a very general
                            indignation. The danger is that Congress, in view of the facts which
                            will be reported undoubtedly by Senator Fall’s sub-Committee on Mexico,
                            will demand drastic action or put us in a position where it will be very
                            difficult to treat the matter with a proper deliberation.</p>

                        <p>I have seen this coming for some time, knowing the vast amount of
                            material collected by the Fall Committee and it was with that purpose
                            that I sought to divert attention to the Jenkins case which I knew could
                            not possibly result in a rupture between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>I thought before you saw these two Senators you should be advised as to
                            the real question which is, as I have said, Carranza’s past record of
                            hostility toward this Government and not the Jenkins case, which can be
                            handled by the Department without endangering our relations with
                            Mexico.</p>
