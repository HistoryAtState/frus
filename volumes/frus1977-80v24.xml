                <p>The Department of State released today a portion of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations of the United States</hi>, 1977–1980, Volume XXIV, South America;
                    Latin America Region. Two compilations in this volume, on Argentina and the
                    Latin America Region, were previously released in October 2017 as part of the
                    Argentina Declassification Project. Today’s publication completes the volume
                    with compilations on nine more South American countries.</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the foreign policy of the Carter
                    administration. The Carter administration’s human rights policy made both a
                    broad and unpredictable impact on U.S. relations with South American nations. In
                    Ecuador, the policy led the United States to press for the first free elections
                    in 6 years, which were held successfully. The same focus on Bolivia, however,
                    could not stave off a period of political instability that saw four coups in
                    just over two years, including the notorious “cocaine coup” in July 1980.
                    Administration perceptions of the different degrees to which countries’ were
                    willing to reform their human rights practices led to a cooling toward Paraguay
                    and a warming toward Uruguay. The ongoing investigation into the assassinations
                    of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and U.S. citizen Ronni
                    Moffitt in Washington in 1976 also led to a deep chill in U.S. relations with
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>Compilations regarding U.S. policy toward a number of other countries focus on
                    other issues. In Venezuela, the administration enjoyed a close working
                    relationship with President Carlos Andres Perez, encompassed by the ongoing
                    investigations into the Cubana Airlines bombing and Letelier assassination. Only
                    occasional high-level attention was paid to Colombia, most notably during a
                    hostage crisis involving U.S. Ambassador Diego Asencio. The compilation on Peru
                    focuses on U.S. relations with its leftist military junta, dealing with the
                    Peruvian economic crisis, and eventual elections. U.S. relations with Brazil
                    were generally cool during the Carter administration, with disputes over
                    non-proliferation, trade, and human rights at the forefront of bilateral
                    problems.</p>

                    volume and press release are available on the Office of the Historian website at
