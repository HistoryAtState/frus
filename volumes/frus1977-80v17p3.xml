                <p>This volume is part of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> subseries that
                    documents the foreign policy decisions of the administration of President Jimmy

                    peace and stability in the Maghreb through a variety of strategies that
                    addressed the many challenges in the region: “normalizing” relations with
                    Algeria and Libya; reassuring Morocco and Tunisia of the administration’s
                    continued support and consultation on the Middle East peace initiative; and
                    serving as an “honest broker” in the regional dispute over the Western
                    Sahara.</p>
                <p>This volume was compiled and edited by Myra F. Burton. The volume and this press

                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the U.S. Government. The Historian of the
                    Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the preparation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of the Office of
                    the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of the General
                    Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate <pb
                        n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>with the Department of State historians
                    by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II) in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977-1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> Presidential Library and other
                    agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been declassified,
                    some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The staff of the Carter
                    Library is processing and declassifying many of the documents used in this
                    volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time of
                    publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Carter Library
                    include some of the most significant foreign-affairs related documentation from
                    White House offices, the Department of State, and other federal agencies
                    including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                    Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments to a given document were in fact attached
                    to the paper copy of the document in the Carter Library file. In such cases,
                    some editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign <pb n="V" facs="0006"
                            xml:id="pg_V"/>Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by
                    stating that the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>Documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to time in
                    Washington, DC. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The original document is reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in the volume. Spelling,
                    capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original text,
                    except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes
                    and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
                    correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases
                    underlined in the original document are printed in italics. Abbreviations and
                    contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations and terms is included in the front matter of each volume. In
                    telegrams, the telegram number (including special designators such as Secto) is
                    printed at the start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld after
                    declassification review have been accounted for and are listed in their
                    chronological place with headings, source notes, and the number of pages not
                    declassified.</p>
                <p>All brackets that appear in the original document are so identified in the
                    footnotes. All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document and its
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related docu<pb n="VI" facs="0007"
                        xml:id="pg_VI"/>ments printed in other volumes, describe key events, and
                    provide summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and
                    elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other
                    first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate
                    the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under

                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the

                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory

                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2015 and was completed in
                    2017, resulted in the decision to withhold 1 document in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 8 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 18 documents. </p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of the <persName

                    Africa.</p>

                    administration’s efforts to promote stability in the Maghreb through a
                    multi-faceted approach that addressed the many challenges in the region:
                    “normalizing” relations with Algeria and Libya; reassuring Morocco and Tunisia
                    of the administration’s continued support and consulting them on the Middle East
                    peace initiative; and serving as an “honest broker” in the regional dispute over
                    the Western Sahara.</p>
                <p>The volume chronicles the Department of State’s efforts to normalize relations
                    with Algeria, largely through an increase in U.S. investment in the country and
                    a commitment to increased educational and cultural exchange. The greatest
                    tangible evidence of the normalization of relations is documented in multiple
                    discussions with Algerian officials on regional issues. Normalizing relations
                    with Libya remained elusive, despite the professed desire of both <persName

                        corresp="#p_QM_1">Muammar Qadhafi</persName> to do so. <persName
                        corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s support for international terrorists,
                    belligerent behavior toward Tunisia, Egypt, and Chad, and aggression toward the
                    United States and its representatives prompted multiple interagency policy
                    reviews and discussions, as well as numerous démarches, none of which proved
                    effective in dealing with the unpredictable <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"

                    abandoned the effort and suspended relations with Libya in May 1980 in the
                    aftermath of the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli in December 1979.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" facs="0009" xml:id="pg_VIII"/>
                <p>Morocco and Tunisia received significant attention from <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, the National Security Council, and the
                    Departments of State and Defense. Both countries were concerned about real and
                    perceived threats from their neighbors in the Maghreb and sought reassurance
                    that the United States would continue to provide security assistance.
                    Congressional concerns over Morocco’s use of U.S. arms in the Western Sahara
                    created tensions with the long-term ally, resulting in several inter-agency
                    reviews. Despite this tension, Morocco, like Tunisia, remained actively engaged
                    in the dialogue over regional problems and supported the administration’s policy
                    toward peace in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Administration concerns that the conflict in Western Sahara would destabilize the
                    region led the Department of State to hold numerous high-level meetings with
                    Moroccan, Algerian, and Mauritanian officials in an attempt to help resolve the
                    conflict. A lower level meeting was also held with a representative of the
                    Polisario. Several members of Congress expressed concern over the conflict and
                    traveled to the region to assess the situation. Despite these efforts, the
                    administration was unable to resolve the differences among the parties and
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> left office without a
                    settlement.</p>

                <p>The Carter Presidential Library is the best source of high-level decisionmaking
                    documentation on U.S. policy toward North Africa during the <persName

                    Affairs, Staff Material, Middle East Subject File is a particularly rich source
                    of documentation on the individual countries in the Maghreb and the
                    administration’s policy toward North Africa in general. The Staff Material,
                    Middle East Trips/Visits File provides documentation on congressional
                    involvement in the region. Comprehensive documentation of bilateral and regional
                    issues is also in the National Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, especially
                    the Country File, Country Chron File, President’s Correspondence with Foreign
                    Leaders File, and the Subject File, which contains memoranda of conversation and
                    the State Department Evening Reports. The National Security Council,
                    Institutional Files contain documents crucial to understanding the policy and
                    decisionmaking process with regard to Libya, Western Sahara and Morocco.</p>
                <p>The National Archives and Records Administration facility in College Park,
                    Maryland (Archives II), houses a variety of Department of State records. The
                    Central Foreign Policy File is an invaluable resource for cables, providing a
                    comprehensive record of day-to-day diplomatic activities and exchanges between
                    the Department of State and diplomatic posts. Additionally, summaries of visits
                    by congressional delegations, officials of other agencies and departments, as
                    well as private citizens can be found here. Department of State Lot Files,
                    particularly the records of <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus R.
                        Vance</persName>, are another rich source of documentation on the
                    development and implementation of Department policy.</p>
                <p>The volume includes several Central Intelligence Agency documents. Files in the
                    Office of Support Services, Directorate of Intelligence, Jobs 80T00071A,
                    82T00267R, 85T00287, and 82T00466R were useful.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on

                                >Farhat</persName> on January 11, shortly after his arrival in
                            Tunisia on official visit. Atmosphere was cordial and meeting served
                            useful purposes.</p>
                        <p>2. It was obvious throughout meeting that Libya still uppermost in minds
                            of Tunisian defense officials (Deputy Defense Minister Bennour,
                            Secretary General Alouini and Navy Chief of Staff Jedidi also present).
                                <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName> stated during meeting
                            that new source of concern was intelligence report received by <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> concerning secret meeting held by
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> on approximately
                            January 1 in which he allegedly outlined his plans for “uniting” with
                            Tunisia. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> supposedly told
                            meeting that while in Moscow he had obtained assurances that if he
                            decided to “take over” Tunisia, Moscow would maintain hands off policy
                            (i.e. would not object to Libyan use of Soviet arms for this purpose).
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> went on to say that
                            he had made definite decision to unify Libya and Tunisia by any means,
                            including force, and that he believed he could count on Algerian support
                            or neutrality in the event he attaked Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName> said he took reported
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> remarks seriously. He
                            believed that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had decided
                            that Egypt was more than he could chew and that he would now turn his
                            attention to Tunisia. <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName> said
                            he believed <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> counting on
                            Egyptian, Iraqi and Palestinian mercenaries, whom he now recruiting, to
                            make up for lack of trained <pb n="2" facs="0023" xml:id="pg_2"
                            />Libyans. <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName> added that in
                            event of hostilities he expected Egypt and Algeria would both remain
                            neutral.</p>
                        <p>4. Questioned further at dinner that evening about seriousness of
                            reported <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> threat, Bennour
                            said it “very disturbing” fresh intelligence acquired only “three or

                        <p>74. Subject: Egyptian Ambassador’s Comments on Egyptian/Libyan
                            Relations.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary. Egyptian Amb in Tripoli views future of relations with Libya
                            pessimistically and with some foreboding. Egypt plans to continue and
                            even step up pressure on <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>2. During meeting January 19 Egyptian Ambassador Tuhmai commented
                            extensively on what he described as bad and deteriorating relations
                            between his country and Libya. Ambassador reiterated that Egyptian
                            complaints against Libya included Libyan sponsorship of the
                                anti-<persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>/Nasserite
                            organization in Libya and Egypt, Libyan sponsored sabotage activities in
                            Egypt and the frozen Egyptian accounts in Libyan banks amounting to some
                            17 million [garble—dinars?]. The Ambassador observed that the Libyans
                            are reorganizing the Nasserite organization among Egyptians in Libya and
                            seeking to recruit young Egyptian students to expand it. Nasserites were
                            responsible for sabotage in Egypt and might be behind current
                            rioting.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador said he felt somewhat insecure in Tripoli though active
                            surveillance had decreased. He added, however, that the possibility of
                            Egyptian and/or Sudanese military intervention in Libya was still
                            possible provided there was a suitable internal situation to warrant it.
                            He felt that in such a case Egyptian Embassy would be subject to open
                            attack. Even under current circumstances the possibility of a <gloss
                                target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> inspired demonstration could not be
                            ruled out. Ambassador claimed his cypher communications system now
                            insecure because of <pb n="3" facs="0024" xml:id="pg_3"/>possible Libyan
                            penetration with Soviet aid. Accordingly, he was under instructions from
                            Cairo to use only couriers.</p>
                        <p>4. Tuhmai saw little possibility for mediation noting that Guinea’s Sekou
                            Toure’s attempt had failed because Libyans had refused to agree to
                            discussion of outstanding problems. Tito, currently in Tripoli, was
                            unlikely to try again this area having already failed once.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador views <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> as
                            feeling increasingly insecure. He tells visiting dignitaries that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> intends to kill him. He
                            has growing concern over what he sees as encirclement by Egypt, Sudan,
                            Chad and possibly Tunisia. Policy of the Egyptian Government, according
                            to Tuhami, will be to do whatever possible to increase this nervousness.
                            Accordingly, former RCC member Muyhayshi is to be unleashed again in the
                            near future over Egyptian radio which now reaches every home in Tripoli.
                            Also <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> himself will make
                            further public statements regarding <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s evil and irrational activities.</p>
                        <p>6. Though charitably suggesting <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> perhaps unaware of everything bad that happened
                            in Libya, Tuhmai doubted possibility of ever reaching a viable
                            understanding with him. He suggested <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            “should get rid of him.” I replied that <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> found <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            very difficult indeed but certainly would not rpt not interfere in
                            internal Libyan affairs.</p>
                        <p>7. In response to a query as to with whom among present Libyan leaders
                            Egypt might possibly work, Ambassador responded that his Embassy had
                            recently had vague and indirect approaches from Prime Minister Jallud
                            whom they regarded as tough and crude but reasonably open. At the same
                            time if separation between eastern and western Libya developed,
                            Egyptians thought that RCC member Kharoubi might well become the leader
                            of the eastern portion and was someone with whom they might also
                            work.</p>
                        <p>8. Tuhami spoke more than he listened but was interested in extent of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> support for C–130 maintenance. I
                            explained status of Lockheed technical group and basics of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/Libyan policy. We agreed to keep in
                            touch. He claimed to have discussed Libyan policy at length with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and <gloss

                            of his somewhat fearsome predictions for the future.</p>

                            point constituted flagrant violation of sovereign rights of Tunisia;

                            and categorically rejected Libyan note as null and void. Libyan

                            would infringe on Tunisian continental shelf. According to Ghezal,

                            requested Tunisian Coast Guard to verify coordinates. Coast Guard patrol
                            boat did so and reported approximately same coordinates as Libyan note

                        <p>6. Also on Feb 17 Italian Ambassador in Tunis informed Tunisian <gloss

                            Tripoli and informed him that if “Tunisian occupation” of drilling rig
                            did not cease, Libyan forces would “open fire”. Tunisia, of course, in

                        <p>9. Comment: Ghezal asked nothing from <gloss target="#t_USG_1"

                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> gained on <gloss

                        <p>1. Summary: Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>
                            reviewed with me at length today Tunisian version of its dispute with
                            Libya over delimitation of continental shelf. He charged Italians with
                            bad faith and recounted complete impasse encountered by Foreign Minister
                            Chatti in talk last week with Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>. He sought U.S. opinion as to wisdom of referral
                            of present dispute to Security Council. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Hedi Nouira</persName> took
                            most of one hundred minute meeting afternoon March 28 to review history
                            of Tunisian-Libyan confrontation over continental shelf and exposition
                            of Tunisian policy thereon. He explained that <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> has been trying since 1968 to obtain delimitation of
                            continental shelf precisely in order to avoid potential armed clash now
                            likely to arise due to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            intransigence.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s basic position, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> explained, has never changed. It
                            seeks pro forma delimitation of continental shelf according to accepted
                            principles of international law. Once defined <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss>’s original and standing offer to exploit oil resources
                            on the continental shelf jointly with Libya still stands. Tunisia today
                            takes the position that dispute should be referred to <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> which should state principles upon
                            which demarcation should be based. Once delimited, disputed area should
                            be exploited by Tunisia in common with Libya. This only just and
                            equitable, Prime Minister insists. Libyan position has constantly
                            shifted to point where Libya now even refused to apply the universally
                            accepted principles of Geneva Convention with regard to “median lines”

                        <p>4. Prime Minister reviewed history of current confrontation arising from
                            drilling by Scarabeo IV as outlined in note submitted March 19 to
                            Italians (Tunis 2049 and 2050) and emphasized Italians’ bad faith in
                            this incident. At this juncture I told Prime Minister of brief talk I
                            had had with Italian Ambassador Giuffrida March 25 who insisted that
                            Italian Foreign Ministry had been unaware of intentions of SAIPEM
                            (AGIP–ENI subsidiary) to drill on disputed site. Prime Minister replied
                            “that may or may not be true”. Involvement of Italians in this incident,
                            he said, was especially sad since Tunisia had “maintained only
                            friendliest of relations with Italy since last Punic War”.</p>

                            disliked going to <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>. He told me
                                <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> had had two hours
                            alone with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and used every
                            possible fraternal and moderate means to persuade <persName

                            peacefully. When <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> remained
                            adamant that he would not negotiate away a single meter of Libyan
                            territory, <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> stated that
                            Tunisia only wished to have Libya agree to execute the accord reached
                            last year to submit dispute to <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1"
                                >ICJ</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d4fn4">In August 1976, Tunisia and

                            <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> replied that Libya would
                            apply that accord when Tunisia agreed to apply the Djerba Accord of 1974
                            (merging the two countries). <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                >Chatty</persName> then made it clear that Libya leaves Tunisia no
                            alternative but to defend its rights by all means at its disposal.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> stated strongly (with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> then reading from
                                <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName>’s cable) that if
                            Tunisia resorts to military methods it would find Libya “stronger than
                            you”. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> also said that
                            Scarabeo IV would soon resume drilling and he hoped <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> would not be foolish enough to try to
                            prevent it. He repeated that “the military balance is not in favor of
                            Tunisia”. <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> replied with
                            regret that Tunisia could only rely upon <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s goodwill or resort to means of self-defense to
                            protect its territory, since Libya refused all offers of arbitration.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> reiterated his
                            refusal to accept any arbitration. Interview was terminated on this
                            unhappy note.</p>
                        <p>6. Prime Minister said he had taken pains to ensure that Tunisia’s
                            friends were aware of each new development in this unhappy story. He has
                            appreciated understanding attitude U.S. has displayed and <pb n="9"

                            expertise given by officers of Department to Tunisian representatives
                            who have visited Washington recently. He thought it was now important to
                            note that if Scarabeo IV resumes drilling <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss> may well be obliged to resort to force to prevent it.
                            He said he had begun to wonder whether the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Security Council could be invoked with a view to
                            settling a possible clash. I told him that, while I was far from expert
                            in Security Council procedures, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter created the Security Council to have jurisdiction in threats to
                            international peace and security and it seemed to me that this would
                            encompass potential threats as well as actual clashes. He asked me if I
                            would obtain the Department’s opinion regarding the likelihood of
                            Security Council acceptance of a Tunisian appeal to it for mediation of
                            this dispute. I promised to do so.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> stated that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s current attitude completely
                            denies <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> the resources of an appeal
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> and obliges it to appeal to
                            international opinion possibly through Security Council. He stated that
                            if Tunisia is proved wrong on subject of boundary it will accept this
                            fact. Tunisia would give up its claims; however, it feels that it should
                            have the right as a peaceful state to have its rights examined
                            peacefully.</p>
                        <p>8. Prime Minister soliloquized at considerable length over plight
                            peaceful, hard-working Tunisia finds itself in today at [garble]
                            troublesome neighbor, Libya. Tunisia has devoted all its efforts to
                            raising the standard of living of its people and promoting their social
                            development. No Arab nation is more Westernized nor more pro-West than
                            Tunisia. If <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> chose to roll
                            across the border with his hundred [garble] Soviet tanks and scores of
                            MiGs, Tunisia would be defenseless, having nothing but Korean War
                            vintage military equipment and a small army to defend itself. Currently,
                            the Prime Minister said, his government is deeply concerned with the
                            inexplicable Libyan prohibition of movements into and out of Libya by
                            all Arabs. “Why is he doing this?” asked <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName>. I told him I had only seen a report of this move
                            in past few hours and was unable to offer any valid explanation. I could
                            only express the hope that reason would prevail and that Tunisia’s
                            persistence in seeking a peaceful solution would prove successful.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: While <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> from time
                            to time referred to a map showing Tunisia’s boundary claim and of oil
                            concessions within it, he volunteered no reference to Tunisian intention
                            to commence drilling at site due north of present position of Scarabeo
                            IV. When I asked whether Tunisia planned any early drilling operations
                            in vicinity of Scarabeo IV (not citing my March 25 talk with Defense
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName>) he indicated

                            to capitals to see Fahmi and Fahd and Iraqi Representative, probably
                            Hammadi, returning to Tunis on March 31. Tunisians had repeatedly asked
                            Italians to comply with their earlier promises about withdrawal of
                            drilling rig, and had sought French support as well. <persName

                            intercede with France and Italy.</p>

                            assistance, including Redeye. <persName corresp="#p_AAL_1"
                                >Atherton</persName> replied that no assurances on increased
                            military assistance were possible at the moment. In any event, Tunisia
                            appeared more in need of diplomatic support from friends. In this
                            regard, he said we would exchange views with France and Italy.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> said this would be
                            helpful particularly in Rome, where Tunis by itself could scarcely
                            compete with Libya, given important Libyan-Italian economic links.
                            Speaking without instructions, he asked the U.S. to give consideration
                            to what further steps could be taken in the event that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> should continue to push
                            Tunisians toward the wall. He specifically recalled U.S.
                            political/military support in August 1976 (extended Sixth Fleet ship

                        <p>5. Comment: Neither <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> nor

                                to associate ourselves with Tunisia’s efforts to prevent the matter
                                from being settled by force. You should note that Tunisians have
                                been eager to drill an exploratory well in disputed zone for over a

                                Libyans. Libyans, in contrast, have exercised no such restraint.”

                        <p>1. When meeting with <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> today,
                            I alluded to current Egyptian-Libyan strains and asked for his latest
                            assessment of Libyan situation.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> claimed Egyptian burning
                            of Libyan Relations Office in Alexandria was in direct retaliation for
                            Libyan action against Egyptian Public Relations Office in Benghazi. He
                            also acknowledged that Libyan diplomatic officials had been forbidden to
                            leave Egypt until Egyptian officials in Libya were allowed to leave.
                            Judging from latest information available to <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss>, Libyans are now allowing Egyptian officials to leave.
                            However, relations between Egypt and Libya are tense and likely to
                            remain so. Border, while not formally closed, is tightly controlled.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GOE_1">GOE</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_FI_1"

                            and is moving to achieve this. Decision has been made to topple him “in
                            best interests of everyone.” <gloss target="#t_GOE_1">GOE</gloss> will
                            try to get rid of him in any way it can. Whether it is able to do so or
                            not, <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> observed, remains to
                            be seen.</p>
                        <p>3. Noting Cairo press reports that <gloss target="#t_GOE_1">GOE</gloss>
                            is submitting a letter to the Arab League about <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_FI_1"
                                >Fahmy</persName> stated that he had included in that letter a
                            statement charging <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> with
                            plotting terrorist activities against “certain Embassies in some Arab
                            countries” and that Egypt will at the appropriate time provide details.
                            In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> stated
                            that he may at some time leak the Libyan threat against me.<note n="3"

                        <p>4. I noted that there continues to be sensitivity in Washington about
                            disclosure and urged that he not do so without first consulting <gloss

                                >Fahmy</persName> responded that Egyptian security officials have
                            now obtained the whole story from the original source. He reiterated his
                            frequently expressed concern that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            is “soft” on <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and seems to
                            be trying to protect him. I told him that, as he should know from talks
                            in Washington, the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is fully alive
                            to the danger <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> represents
                            and is in no way seeking to protect him. As he also knew, we have been
                            skeptical of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s overtures
                            and have thus far refused Libya’s suggestions to exchange Ambassadors,
                            release C–130’s and take various other measures which Libya wants. Our
                            Egyptian friends must recognize, however, that we must handle our
                            relations with Libya in a manner which we consider will best serve
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests.</p>

                        <p>Chadian Ambassador Toura Gaba’s letter to you of May 16<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d8fn2">Not found.</note> emphasized two major concerns of
                            his government. He requested one or two aircraft and crew to distribute
                            donated foodstuffs to the drought areas of Chad before the rainy season.
                            He requested some form of security assistance to help Chad cope with
                            Libyan “expansionist designs.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Chadian Drought</hi></p>
                        <p>International donors have agreed to contribute 32,400 tons of food to
                            Chad because of this year’s recurrence of a severe drought in that
                            nation, over half of which comes from <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            sources. Of the total aid, less than 5,000 tons have arrived in Chad. A
                            small German airlift is already underway as an interim measure to supply
                            eastern Chad until food arrives by truck. The French are prepared to
                            mount a limited airlift to the northern area of Chad.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Chad has made several requests over the past six months
                            to us for a food relief airlift. Given the inordinately high cost of
                            previous food airlifts in 1973 and 1974, we have resisted the Chadian
                            approaches. We have told the Chadians that we would only consider an
                            airlift as a way to move food aid after all methods of moving food by
                            conventional transport had been exhausted, or were ineffective. Poor
                            planning by the Government of Chad and the fast approaching rainy season
                            may, however, force us to give serious consideration next month to an
                            airlift or to funding expanded airlifts by other donor nations. Chadian
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> recently told
                            our Ambassador he could not understand why “a great country like the
                            U.S.” could not meet his request for planes to distribute food relief.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> recalls that the
                            politics of famine played a role in the downfall of his predecessor,
                            Tombalbaye.</p>

                            activity in northern and eastern Chad. In the east, the Chadian army has
                            tried to confront the rebel forces led by Hissene Habre. The most recent
                            operation, in which the Chadians used for the first time Soviet
                            equipment acquired in the wake of our refusal to supply Chad with heavy
                            equipment in 1975 proved a dismal failure. <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName> is also very upset by the fact that Libya has
                            occupied a sizeable strip of territory in northern Chad, and has long
                            supported rebel forces against the Chadian Government. Our Ambassador
                            replied to President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> by
                            outlining the Administration’s new arms policy, and suggesting that
                            further discussion be deferred until after you had an opportunity to

                        <p>704. Subj: Continental Shelf Dispute: Libyan Demarche.</p>
                        <p>1. Libyan Under Sec. FonAffairs Atrash summoned me morning May 30 for
                            presentation Libyan position on continental shelf dispute and to charge
                            that presence U.S. naval unit in area dangerously complicates matter and
                            threatens great power confrontation.</p>
                        <p>2. Atrash opened by stating that Tunisians were creating a problem over
                            Libyan offshore exploration. The Tunisian media allegations were totally
                            untrue, said Atrash, since exploration had been underway for some time
                            in an area of the continental shelf which comes under Libyan sovereignty
                            according to accepted principles of international law. Tunisian decision
                            to make an issue of Libyan exploration in this area was probably due to
                            encouragement from “other sources”.</p>
                        <p>3. Libyan Government was very surprised to learn of presence U.S. naval
                            unit in Gabes. Presence this ship, Atrash charged, has encouraged
                            Tunisians to act aggressively towards Libya. U.S. involvement in this
                            way will further aggravate dispute. He asked that I inform <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> that Libyan Government takes U.S.
                            naval presence in disputed area very seriously and requests that U.S.
                            ship be withdrawn for “safety all parties concerned”. Atrash said that
                            if situation deteriorates further, and if Tunisians attack, Libya will
                            be forced to “fight back in self defense.” Should U.S. naval unit take
                            any action on behalf Tunisia, “it might be subject to our attack as
                            well.”</p>
                        <p>4. Atrash said dispute is between two neighboring Arab countries and
                            presence foreign naval units in disputed area dangerously complicates
                            situation. Libya for its part might be forced to invite naval unit from
                            a “friendly country” which would surely escalate the situation into a
                            “direct encounter in the disputed area.” (Comment: Atrash clearly means
                            that the Soviets might be invited, leading to a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Soviet confrontation).</p>
                        <p>5. Atrash said Libya wants to solve problem peacefully, and is willing to
                            hold discussions with Tunisia. Secretary Fon Affairs Turayki had hoped
                            to go to Tunis Saturday,<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">June 4.</note> but
                            “Tunisians had made it impos<pb n="18" facs="0039" xml:id="pg_18"/>sible
                            for him to leave Tripoli.” Libya hopes wisdom will prevail, but Tunisian
                            propaganda and “unfriendly attitude” makes negotiated solution
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>6. I told Atrash that his presentation would be forwarded immediately. I
                            also said that U.S. policy is to avoid taking a position on legal merits
                            of shelf or other boundary disputes to which we not a party and to
                            advise U.S. drilling companies to stay out of disputed waters. This is
                            longstanding policy and is applied generally in other disputed areas as
                            well. Our hope is for peaceful settlement, and we are concerned over
                            safety and welfare U.S. citizens on drilling rig which contracted by
                            Libyan NOC and Reading &amp; Bates contrary <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> advice to U.S. company. We hoped Libya would take no
                            precipitate action which would imperil our citizens or make peaceful
                            resolution more difficult. As for naval unit, U.S. 6th Fleet ships call
                            routinely at Tunisian and other ports in Med., and these visits are
                            usually scheduled several months in advance.</p>
                        <p>7. When I asked for clarification of his remarks that U.S. ship might be
                            subject to Libyan attack, Atrash said that he did not mean to imply a
                            Libyan threat to U.S. naval units. He meant only that Libya would have
                            to respond if attacked, and that Libya is concerned that U.S. naval
                            units might take “some action” on behalf Tunisia. In response my query
                            whether Libya would agree outside arbitration of dispute Atrash
                            evasively said that Tunisians had turned down several Libyan suggestions
                            for solution.</p>

                            has now received official confirmation that the Government of Tunisia
                            has changed its <pb n="20" facs="0041" xml:id="pg_20"/>position with
                            respect to its previous policy of insisting that your rig depart the

                            negotiations with the Libyan Government looking to a negotiated
                            settlement of this matter. The Tunisian Government has also officially
                            confirmed that it has extended the “deadline” as concerns the presence
                            and continued drilling of your rig from 10 to 15 days. Given the fact
                            that official negotiations are actually underway and that both
                            governments are reportedly working to find an acceptable compromise, it
                            is clear that the situation has been, to a large extent, defused.

                        <p>1. Now that the dust has settled from crisis with Libya over continental
                            shelf, it is becoming clear extent to which political establishment here
                            has been shaken by these events. Reasons for <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss>’s sudden shift from position of no compromise on issue
                            of American drilling rig to one of accommodation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> also now clearer. Tunisia may
                            have been quite close to use of force against rig and incursion into
                            Libya. President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s
                            abrupt reversal of this plan may have saved the day but may also have so
                            damaged Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>’s
                            prestige that his survival in that position may be in jeopardy.</p>

                        <p>3. In addition to these reports, we have also had conversations in last
                            several days in which well-placed Tunisians have described same events
                            as extremely damaging to <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>.
                            One of Tunisia’s most influential and cleverest lawyers told Ambassador
                            that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> is as
                            good as finished as result of continental shelf crisis (lawyer is,

                            of financial mismanagement and corruption. He said that <persName

                            taxpayers revolt (and alleged basis for current liquidity problem), and
                            that if he persisted <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> revenues may
                            dry up. He also said, interestingly, that <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> had not only been prepared to allow human

                            but had prepared message of greeting for meeting. He was convinced by

                            to allow meeting only a few hours before it was to take place. Lawyer
                            made strong pitch for now bringing “liberals” in government.</p>
                        <p>4. In separate conversation senior Foreign Ministry official told DCM
                            that serious consequences [garble] continental shelf crisis were avoided
                            only by <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s wise decision
                            to avoid confrontation with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>. However, events had revealed a serious failure
                            of political leadership on part of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> and other senior party
                            officials. Describing June 6 Political Bureau meeting at which it was

                                >Bourguiba</persName> opened meeting by waving before members of
                            Bureau telegram from disgraced former Foreign Minister Masmoudi
                            counseling compromise. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            said it was a sorry state of affairs when best advice available to him
                            came from a man he had been obliged to dismiss. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> then turned angrily on Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> and said “as for
                            you, you know neither how to make war nor how to make peace.” President
                            announced he was taking matter into his own hands and that there would
                            be no confrontation. Following meeting, <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> offered to resign but his offer was rather
                            contemptuously brushed aside by President. Foreign Ministry official
                            said best solution now was for <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> to
                            readmit disaffected political figures like Ahmed Nestiri to positions of

                                >Hassan</persName> of Morocco had advised <persName

                        <p>5. Comment: It is quite unusual for anyone in an official position or in
                            the public eye here to speak in such a manner about government
                            leadership. It would seem probable that they dare to do so now only
                            because they believe <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> is
                            indeed seriously if not fatally weakened. If above reports are accurate,
                            they go a long way to explain sudden change of course by <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> at height of crisis. They also give us
                            sobering idea of the degree to which <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> can cause disruption in Tunisia at little cost
                            to himself. Consequences of chain of events beginning with positioning
                            of Italian drilling rig Scarabeo IV in waters claimed by Tunisia are
                            apparently far from over. Among most disquieting results is not only
                            damage to political leadership but effect on morale in Tunisian armed
                            forces. Happily, <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> is
                            still in good enough shape to make decision that avoided unpredictable
                            confrontation with Libya; but as Foreign Ministry official noted to us,
                            it is disquieting for Tunisia that in a moment of crisis an old sick man
                            must take over policy personally.</p>

                            re Chad and Niger.</p>
                        <p>Summary: <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> wants President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to know of urgent
                            message received from Chadian President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName> re <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>-supported rebel threat. Rebels apparently moving
                            on Fort Lamy. Joint Egyptian/Sudanese military mission sent to Chad to
                            assess situation and make recommendations on military assistance.
                            Chadian rebels had also attacked Genayna, an important religious town in
                            Western Sudan, which suggests to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> that they hold at least half of Chad. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> impatient with Numayri who seems
                            to be “sleeping on his ear.” Niger President also advised <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> threat and asked for military assistance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> intends to provide both
                            Chad and Niger with military aid, including perhaps some “commandos” to
                            Chad. He sees these activities as <pb n="25" facs="0046" xml:id="pg_25"
                            />part of Soviet threat to moderate regimes in Africa, ultimately aimed
                            at getting rid of Numayri and him. He asks President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> for:</p>
                        <p>(A) Small arms and vehicular equipment (amounts unspecified) for use in
                            helping Chad and Niger;</p>
                        <p>(B) <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> assistance in preventing
                            Israelis from exploiting his current pre-occupation with Africa by
                            mounting some kind of military action against Arab state. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> asked me to meet with him
                            last evening. He had just arrived from Alexandria and was preparing for
                            his departure today for <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Summit in
                            Libreville. He wished following to be conveyed to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> in furtherance of his dialogue
                            with <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> on Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Five days earlier he had received an urgent message from B/G <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Felix Malloum</persName>, Chairman of the Supreme
                            Military Council of Chad. <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName>
                            had at same time sent a message to Numayri. <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName>’s two messages noted that Chadian “guerrillas,”
                            supported by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, had
                            occupied the northern part of Chad during the regime of former President
                            Tombalbaye. (According to <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had earlier told him
                            that the northern Chad region had been bought from Tombalbaye for two
                            million dollars, which the former Chadian President had put into a Swiss
                            bank.) The armed guerrillas, according to <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName>, are pressing southward toward Fort Lamy
                                (<persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> at no time used
                            “N’djamena”). <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> had asked
                            for Egyptian assistance to meet the threat. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> said he views this development as part of the
                            Soviet game plan in Africa. They are using <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> against Chad and the Sudan, just as they are
                            using Ethiopia against the Sudan. He has been on the verge of asking
                                <persName corresp="#p_GMAG_1">Gamasy</persName> to go to the Sudan
                            and recommend to Numayri that Egypt and Sudan take some joint initiative
                            to assist Chad. However, “my friends in the Sudan—they are lazy.”</p>
                        <p>3. He had then read of a raid on the Sudanese town of Genayna, just west
                            of the Sudanese/Chad border. This had taken place five days earlier.
                            Genayna, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> explained, is an
                            important religious center in central and east Africa. It was from this
                            town that Islam entered Africa through the Senusi movement. Numayri, the
                            “idiot,” had sent him nothing about the attack on Genayna, although four
                            Sudanese soldiers had been killed. The attack had been made, not by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName>’s forces, but by
                            Chadian rebels armed by <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s purpose, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> noted, is identical to the Soviet
                            objective: to get Numayri and then <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Before sending <persName corresp="#p_GMAG_1">Gamasy</persName>, he had
                            finally gotten a message from Numayri referring to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName>’s message and asking what
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> thought ought to be
                            done. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had replied that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOE_1">GOE</gloss> is sending a military
                            delegation, first to the Sudan and then to Chad, and that it should be a
                            joint Sudanese/Egyptian military delegation. Purpose would be to assess
                            the situation and to assure <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName> that Egypt and Sudan are with him whatever the
                            consequences. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is still <pb
                                n="26" facs="0047" xml:id="pg_26"/>awaiting report from his mission,
                            but he expressed annoyance that it had taken the Sudanese two days
                            before they were ready to join the Egyptian component. He understood
                            that the Chadian rebels are apparently approaching Fort Lamy.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> then produced a map in
                            order to point out Genayna’s position just inside the Sudanese border.
                            The Chadian rebels had had to cross virtually all of Chad to get to the
                            Western Sudan. This suggested to him that more than half of Chad might
                            be under rebel control. All this was happening while the Sudanese are
                            “sleeping on their ears.” The situation was “fantastic,” especially
                            since he understood that the Chadian rebel movement has no more than
                            3,000 guerrillas. Some action is necessary to help President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> against the rebels. He was
                            still awaiting joint military delegation’s report before deciding what
                            to do.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> then pointed on map to
                            Niger, whose President had two days earlier instructed Niger Ambassador
                            to inform <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> of his concern
                            about <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. The President of
                            Niger had asked <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> to assist
                            him with arms. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> said he had
                            promised to provide arms (but no soldiers) and that both Chad and Niger
                            could depend on Egypt and the Sudan. He would use his Antonovs to send
                            arms. Here <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> noted that
                            Algeria has also taken a threatening position towards Niger.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> continued that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOE_1">GOE</gloss> now has responsibilities in both Chad
                            and Niger. He had given his word and, whatever the cost, he would fight
                            his battle. Chad and Niger leaders relying on his word. He wished
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> “to be in the
                            picture” and recalled that he had previously asked for arms for African
                            “brushfires” which he might have to extinguish.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> said he wanted two things
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>:</p>
                        <p>(A) Some small arms and efficient cars for use in these African areas
                            (numbers not specified). Semi-track would be best, but jeeps would be
                            all right. If we are not willing to send American arms, he understood
                            that <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> has large quantities of Soviet
                            arms. Perhaps these could be sent.</p>
                        <p>(B) In view of his pre-occupation with Africa, he was concerned that
                            Begin—and especially, Weizman, as Minister of Defense—might undertake
                            some pre-emptive strike against the Arabs. He asked President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to keep the Israelis from
                            seeking to exploit the situation, through any kind of military action
                            while he is busy in Africa.</p>
                        <p>9. Although this was the gist of his message, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> repeated his points several times, stressing his
                            conviction that the Soviets are behind <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>. He recalled Golda Meir’s description of
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> as a “monkey with a
                            checkbook.” Whatever the situation in Chad requires, he would assist.
                            While he could not send troops, he might send some commandos <pb n="27"
                                facs="0048" xml:id="pg_27"/>if necessary. It will depend upon what
                            his military mission recommends. The Sudan, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> noted, might be able to send troops.</p>

                        <p>1. Vice President Djime called me to his office this evening, and
                            requested my advice on how to go about making arrangements for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> to go to Washington
                            immediately and present Chad’s request for assistance personally to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. He stressed
                            that arms were pouring into northern Chad from Libya and situation is
                            becoming desperate. For first time he stated categorically that he
                            believed Soviets were behind present Libyan push. I assured Vice
                            President that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            was already aware of the situation in Chad. I explained the many
                            problems concerned with such a visit, but said that I wanted to sleep on
                            the problem and I would call him in the morning.</p>
                        <p>2. Realize the short notice and complicated subject matter of such a
                            visit make it extremely difficult. However, if we are going to grant
                            Chad any assistance believe we could profit from the visit as a visible
                            sign of our interest in helping moderate African states defend their
                            territorial integrity against outside aggression. If we are not going to
                            grant any assistance it is better for me to say “no” here rather than
                            have it said in Washington.</p>

                        <p>3. Please advise as to what line I should take with Vice President in
                                morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">In telegram 157286 to Ndjamena,

                                constraints. First, providing equipment as a grant is impossible
                                without a prior Presidential Determination that it is important to
                                the security interests of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and
                                the prior appropriation of funds by the Congress. Given the
                                prevailing attitude in the administration and the Congress towards
                                the provision of military equipment particularly under new programs,
                                neither is likely even if speed were not important. Second,
                                government to government sale of military items requires a finding
                                of eligibility (i.e. that it is important to the security interests

                        <p>1. In about January 1977, Egyptian President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Anwar al-Sadat</persName> gave orders that Libyan leader <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Mu’ammar Qadhafi</persName> was to be removed, by
                            covert political action if possible, but if political action was
                            impossible, by overt military operation. No time limit was set, but it
                            was clear <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> wanted action
                            sooner rather than later. Since the initial effort was to be political
                            action via an indigenous coup d’etat Egyptian General Intelligence (GI)
                            was assigned primary responsibility. About April 1977, in the absence of
                            a coup d’etat, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> ordered that
                            plans be made for a military incursion in which an armored brigade would
                            drive across northeastern Libya to Benghazi. On the basis of
                            intelligence information given him by GI, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> was persuaded that the Egyptian incursion would be
                            welcomed enthusiastically by the Libyan masses, provoking them to rise
                            against <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and bringing
                            about a change of regime. In the meantime, GI was to continue its search
                            for a coup group and Egyptian Military Intelligence (MI) was to alert
                            sabotage nets already in place in Libya.</p>
                        <p>2. In early June 1977, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> began
                            pressuring Minister of War General Muhammad ’abd al-Ghani al-Jamasi to
                            hasten the planning and preparation for the brigade incursion, because
                            of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s growing conviction
                            that the military option was the only recourse for bringing down
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. Jamasi and senior MI
                            officers were reluctant to mount such an incursion, however, because
                            intelligence collected by MI did not support GI’s assessment of
                            widespread Libyan popular dissatisfaction or readiness to rise against
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. To the contrary,
                            MI’s assessment was that the Egyptian brigade would not be able to reach
                            Benghazi in force, although commando units would, and thus could not
                            take the city. MI believed that the Libyan masses would rally behind
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to repel or halt the
                            Egyptian invader. Thus, the Egyptians would be left with two options: to
                            withdraw in humiliation back to Egypt; or to occupy what territory they
                            could control in northeast Libya. In the latter case, Egypt would only
                            succeed in uniting the Libyan population behind <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> as never before, and would
                            probably also end <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            isolation from his Arab colleagues. MI intelligence indicated that while
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> did in fact
                            exist in Libya, it was passive and unorganized, and practically certain
                            to stand with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> against any
                            “liberating” force from Egypt. Through Jamasi, MI recommended that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> again shelve the
                            military option and that MI be given permission to launch widespread and
                            continuing sabotage throughout Libya. This course, according to MI,
                            would destabilize <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and
                            open the way for an indigenous move against him which the Egyptians
                            could actively support.</p>
                        <p>3. By late June 1977, <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> was
                            ninety per cent convinced of the military option and gave orders that
                            preparations for a military incur<pb n="30" facs="0051" xml:id="pg_30"
                            />sion were to proceed. Coincidentally, MI was receiving confirmed
                            intelligence that Libya was reinforcing its eastern defenses and that
                            Soviet and Cuban military advisors were assisting this effort. Moreover,
                            MI believed that while the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> would
                            not commit Soviet forces to defend Libya against Egypt, Soviet signal
                            ships anchored in the Gulf of Sallum would be used to jam and distort
                            Egyptian military communications.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>] Jamasi was
                            scheduled to meet with the heads of MI and GI for an objective review of
                            Egyptian capabilities for bringing down <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>. If this review does not develop a viable
                            political action alternative, it is possible that the brigade size
                            military incursion will be launched before the beginning of the month of

                        <p>The Secretary began with a brief welcome.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President replied by acknowledging the Secretary’s welcome. He
                            said he had come to Washington on very short notice, and greatly
                            appreciated the opportunity to call on the Secretary and later the Vice
                            President, despite their busy schedules. He said he had come because the
                            security of the Chadian state and Chad’s territorial integrity were
                            threatened. He said the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> plays an
                            important role in the world and that the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> is virtually Chad’s only hope for assistance. “However”,
                            he said, “Chad knows it can count on the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had been following events in Chad closely,
                            and that President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had
                            drawn our attention to the urgency of Chad’s needs. The Secretary asked
                            the Vice President to outline the situation in Chad so that he could
                            evaluate the situation in light of the Vice President’s statement.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that Chad was the object of imperialist
                            aggression designed to destroy the country. Under the previous Chadian
                            administration, Libya had occupied Aouzou. For the past ten years there
                            had been a rebellion in the area. The Vice President said the objective
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName>’s
                            administration was to achieve reconciliation with the rebels. The policy
                            has had some success, but many rebels have reacted by waiting to see
                            what the results of the policy would be before laying down their
                            arms.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President continued that some of the Toubou rebels do not wish
                            to be reconciled to the Chadian Government because they are under the
                            influence of Libyan President Quadhafi. Quadhafi controls Goukouni, the
                            present leader of the rebels in the Tibesti. The Vice President said
                            that Quadhafi is under Soviet control, and is also inspired by the old
                            Senussi idea of expansion, but chiefly, said the Vice President, it is
                            the Soviet Union that is pushing Quadhafi and supplying arms for the
                            rebels. Because Chad is pro-west, the Soviets are attempting to
                            penetrate Chad, a move which would be followed by the penetration of
                            other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said Quadhafi’s first step had been to send food to
                            the border area and to create employment. The tactic had been successful
                            and many Toubou had joined FROLINAT, the rebel party, in order to get
                            work. Quadhafi is now exploiting his influence in the area, and is
                            defeating the Chadian Government’s efforts to achieve
                            reconciliation.</p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_32"/>
                        <p>Turning to the military situation, the Vice President said that on June
                            20 Ounianga Kebir had been attacked. The attackers had artillery,
                            bazookas, and mortars. Although the Chadian garrison was surrounded, a
                            relief column from the south managed to break through. Some rebels were
                            killed and Soviet arms with Libyan markings were captured.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that on June 22–23 Bardai and Zouar were
                            attacked. Zouar beat off the attackers, but Bardai was surrounded and,
                            because the rebels held the heights around the town, was eventually
                            forced to surrender. The Chadian Army lost 350 men with their equipment,
                            a serious loss. Chad was obliged to evacuate Zouar and to regroup at
                            Largeau and Ounianga Kebir. Now, said the Vice President, with your help
                            we may hope to regain the offensive.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how many men the Chadian Government had in the area.
                            The Vice President replied by describing the strengths of some of the
                            garrisons and concluded that the total Chadian force in the area was
                            between 1100 to 1500 men.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the Chadian Army required. The Vice President
                            replied that aircraft and armor were essential.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> asked if the Libyans
                            had used armor or air in the attack on Chadian forces. The Vice
                            President replied that Libyan planes landed at central airports to
                            deliver supplies. He said Libyan ground troops are heavily armed and the
                            Chadian support aircraft have been fired upon. However, the Chadians
                            have not been attacked from the air. The Vice President said the rebels
                            have armor. Quadhafi is said to have given them six tanks, although
                            these have not been seen.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that if Chad had sufficient aircraft Bardai would
                            not have fallen. He again made a plea for assistance and then gave the
                            Secretary a paper outlining Chadian requirements. (A translation of the
                            paper is attached.) The Secretary asked for and received an explanation
                            of some of the details of the Chadian request.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if it were true that the government controlled the
                            south and the rebels controlled the Tibesti. The Vice President replied
                            that the government controlled certain centers in the north, but that
                            the rebels were active outside these settlements.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what commitments had been made by other countries.
                            The Vice President replied that Egypt and Sudan had offered political
                            support by seeking to encourage a reconciliation between the Chadian
                            Government and Habre, a rebel leader formerly closely allied with
                            Goukouni, now active in eastern Chad. Neither country had provided much
                            material yet, although Egypt had offered small arms. In response to the
                            Secretary’s question, the Vice President said Egypt had declined to
                            provide aircraft because the Egyptians have their own <pb n="33"
                                facs="0054" xml:id="pg_33"/>problems. The Vice President said that
                            France has provided AD–4s, but these are old planes and are nearly worn
                            out. France provided pilots for these planes. France has sent several
                            Transalls, which were used to evacuate Zouar. Gabon has loaned Chad two
                            AD–4’s.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary’s question, the Vice President said Chad
                            does not have pilots and the AD–4’s have civilian French pilots. The
                            Vice President requested armament for spotter planes bought in
                            Switzerland and for armor to protect convoys on the road.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that the Vice President would see Vice President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName> the following
                                day.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">See <ref target="#d18fn2">footnote
                                    2, Document 18</ref>.</note> He continued that he wished to
                            study the Chadian request carefully and that we would be in touch with
                            the Chadian Government. The Secretary said he could not make promises,
                            but that he would examine the request sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that Morocco had sent three experts to N’Djamena
                            but the results of their trip are not yet known.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> if
                            there were any other countries to which we have provided equipment which
                            might be transferred to Chad. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> agreed to look into it.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that he had a personal letter from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> for President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> but that in view of
                            the fact that the President was too busy to see him, he wished to give
                            it to the Secretary for delivery to the President. The Secretary replied
                            that he would see the President at breakfast the following day and would
                            deliver the letter to him at that time. The Secretary said the President
                            would reply at a later date.<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">See <ref

                                have been called up, Chad needs to receive supplies from A to Z
                                (clothing, vehicles, arms, ammunition, communications equipment,
                                etc.), for a motorized, or rather mechanized (<gloss
                                    target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>) U.S. Army Battalion.</p>
                            <p>Chad has two Pilatus PC 6 aircraft which are judged the best type of
                                aircraft for visual reconnaissance, including surveillance of the
                                northern boundary and the detection of convoys from Libya.
                                Switzerland sold us these airplanes without appropriate equipment
                                and arms. We have contacted the Matra Company at Velizy, France, to
                                equip these two airplanes with rocket launchers, machine gun
                                capability, and bombs.</p>
                            <p>This operation was so costly that we were forced to forego it,
                                despite the critical importance of <hi rend="italic">armed</hi>
                                reconnaissance in the current situation. Could the United States
                                equip these airplanes with armament, or if not, cover the cost of
                                the operation which would then be carried out at Matra?</p>
                            <p>In order to provide fuel for both the ground and air forces, Chad
                                needs to obtain free fuel, or equivalent funds in order to pay its
                                suppliers directly.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Chadian Vice President Djime is in Washington on very short notice to
                            make a personal request for military assistance. He saw the Secretary of
                            State today at 3:00 p.m., who conveyed our sympathy and promised to
                            carefully consider his request. No commitment was made. He is scheduled
                            to see Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName>
                            tomorrow, July 15, at 2:00 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Chad is fighting two insurgencies which are supported by Libya, who most
                            probably hopes to establish permanent control over northern Chad. Libya
                            has occupied a disputed strip in northwest Chad since 1973. Thanks to
                            Libyan support, the situation in northern Chad has now seriously
                            deteriorated.</p>
                        <p>Chad has requested combat and transport aircraft, with crews, equipment
                            to outfit 1500 reserve infantrymen, combat rations and fuel. They have
                            been informed that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will not
                            provide personnel.</p>
                        <p>France is providing technical assistance and spare parts; Egypt and the
                            Sudan have sent military missions to study Chad’s needs; Morocco has
                            expressed sympathy but made no commitments. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> sees the situation as
                            Libyan/Soviet expansionism which may well be aimed at him and the Sudan.
                            He requested urgently that you receive Djime. We have informed him that
                            the Vice President will do so.</p>
                        <p>The rebellion does not yet directly affect the survival of the
                            government; if insurgent successes continue unchecked it will soon do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>I believe it is in our interest to provide at least some military
                            assistance to Chad in this situation. State has divided on the issue and
                            effectively expressed no opinion.</p>
                        <p>Arguments against doing so include the fact that Chad’s northern
                            territory is probably already lost, other governments are assisting, and
                            it would perhaps be undesirable to inaugurate a new <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military supply commitment.</p>
                        <p>But the stronger arguments, in my opinion, lie on the side of giving
                            minor assistance. Chad has been a friend of the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss>; it has a good human rights record; there is here a
                            direct threat to its territorial integ<pb n="36" facs="0057"
                                xml:id="pg_36"/>rity; our assistance would be consistent with our
                            emerging policy of aiding moderate African states. Further, to give
                            limited military aid would preserve some <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> influence and credibility on an evolving range of
                            problems in the Western Sahara, and preserve our influence in the
                            Chadian government. It would help contain Libyan expansionism in the
                            area and in that light be viewed favorably by Egypt and probably Morocco
                            and the Sudan. As in Zaire, indigenous rebels backed by a neighboring
                            country have attempted to acquire effective control over territory. This
                            situation is more blatant in that Libya not only openly supports the
                            rebels but has militarily occupied Chadian territory. Other than the
                            Soviet Union being Libya’s largest arms supplier, we have no evidence of
                            Soviet involvement in this situation.</p>
                        <p>It would enhance the above interests if Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName> could send Djime back to Chad

                            national security of the United States. For sales exceeding $7 million,
                            Congress must be consulted 30 days in advance. State is inclined against
                            making Chad eligible, arguing that this would be the first determination

                            determination is the fact that it would enable us to transfer both

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Egypt-Libya Border Fighting:</hi> A series of sharp,
                            though limited, Libyan attacks launched over the past 24 hours against
                            several Egyptian border outposts mark a significant escalation of the
                            continuing low-level dispute between the two countries. The Libyans
                            apparently surprised the Egyptian forces and the latter, who have
                            responded with tactical air strikes, appear to be having difficulty in
                            organizing the defense of their outposts. The outcome of the fighting is
                            so far unclear, however.</p>
                        <p>We believe <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> ordered the
                            Libyan attacks as a show of force to prove Libyan strength and
                            preparedness and to force the Egyptians off balance.</p>
                        <p>Egypt will at a minimum counter the Libyan provocation with similar raids
                            against Libyan border positions. We do not believe <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> will immediately implement his
                            long-considered military incursion into Eastern Libya, mainly because
                            Egyptian preparations are apparently not yet complete.</p>
                        <p>Recent reports indicated that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> has become increasingly persuaded that the
                            military option (an incursion into Eastern Libya by one or more
                            brigades, or perhaps a land and airborne raid against Tobruk) is the
                            only one which has a chance for success. Therefore, we cannot rule out a
                            major Egyptian-initiated escalation of the border fighting in the near
                            future (one to four weeks), particularly if the intensity of the
                            military incidents does not abate. In the next day or so we should be
                            able to judge whether either side will try to escalate the
                                fighting.<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">In a July 20 memorandum to

                        <p>1. Realistically, we can do very little for Chad in either military or
                            economic aid in the near future.</p>
                        <p>2. The principal constraints in military aid are the provisions in our
                            own legislation and the fact that Chad has no money. Grant assistance
                            would require specific congressional authorization, and for practical
                            purposes is out of the question. Chad is not eligible for Foreign
                            Military Sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>), but we are
                            preparing a draft Presidential Determination that sales of defense
                            articles and services to Chad under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            will strengthen the security of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            and promote world peace.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d24">Document 24</ref>.</note> Such a determination is
                            a condition of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> eligibility. Under
                            present circumstances, the only way Chad can obtain military equipment
                            from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is to buy it from commercial
                            sources. Chad’s Foreign Minister is about to leave for Jidda, and
                            presumably will request financing to purchase military equipment. If the
                            President were to determine that Chad is eligible for <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>, Chad could purchase through <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> but would still require financing.
                            Chad is not interested in credit, except on the most favorable terms. If
                            Chad were <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> eligible, and we were
                            able to reprogram <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 77 funds, it might
                            be possible to arrange <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits for
                            Chad. We are asking <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> to look into this
                            possibility. I understand there is already quite a list of claimants,
                            including Lebanon and Tunisia.</p>
                        <p>3. Chad could obtain <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> origin equipment
                            through transfers from third countries. Chad has approached Zaire,
                            Gabon, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan and will raise third country transfers
                            with Saudi Arabia and perhaps Jordan. (FYI: Gabon has declined to
                            provide further assistance to Chad because President Bongo is now
                            President of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. Egypt has no <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> origin lethal equipment and little if

                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> which would help Chadians.) Transfers of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> origin equipment/services to a
                            country that is not <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> eligible, such
                            as Chad, require a determination by the Secretary that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> would be willing to transfer the
                            equipment in question directly to Chad, and that the proposed transfers
                            will strengthen the security of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            and promote world peace. Furthermore, before transfers of <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> origin items are approved, Congress
                            must be notified 30 working days in advance.</p>
                        <p>4. Increasing our economic aid to Chad in the short-run will be extremely
                            difficult. We have a <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> Title II
                            program designed to make up shortfalls in last year’s harvest. This
                            program is valued at 7 million dols, about half of which is the value of
                            the commodities and about half the cost of transporting it to Chad. Chad
                            has requested, as part of its military assistance package, 50 tons of
                            rice but we cannot provide this under <gloss target="#t_PL480_1"
                                >PL–480</gloss> because <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss>
                            cannot be used for military purposes. The principal problem in the
                            present <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> program has been a
                            bottleneck at the railhead in Cameroon (N’Gaoundere) which has now been
                            broken. Chad had requested an airlift to distribute food within Chad,
                            which we turned down because it was not, and is not now, necessary. An
                            airlift at this point would be a dramatic demonstration of our support
                            for Chad, but would also be expensive and unnecessary, and would not
                            directly assist Chad in maintaining its territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>5. Our economic assistance to Chad in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                            77 amounts to about 4 million dols, chiefly devoted to increasing food
                            production over the long-run. It would be very difficult to accelerate
                            any plans now in preparation to increase this assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. In sum, subject to our readiness to take necessary policy decisions,
                            for the time being the best advice we can give Chad is to solicit
                            financing from countries such as Saudi Arabia in order to be able to buy
                            military equipment from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> or
                            elsewhere through commercial channels. A somewhat more lengthy and
                            complex procedure would be to solicit such transfers of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> origin equipment from other countries as
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> would agree to.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> may raise with you the
                            possibility of replacing military equipment including small arms, which
                            are not of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> origin, to Chad.
                            Presidential Determination on arms for Egypt has now been signed.<note

                            would require consultations with the Congress and could impact adversely
                            on our “non-lethal” package on the Hill.</p>

                        <p>8. In our discussions with other countries on assistance to Chad, we have
                            found very little support for a meeting of potential donors. The French
                            have suggested a concertation of assistance through a series of
                            bilateral contacts. Belgium and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss>
                            may be possible sources of economic assistance, but are unlikely to
                            provide Chad with any military assistance. Also, it appears that Morocco
                            and the Sudan, though sympathetic to Chad, may only be able to provide
                            at the most very little military assistance such as small arms and
                            ammunition. Embassy Jidda believes Saudi Arabia would be willing to
                            participate financially in a multilateral effort. Embassy Tehran
                            believes Iran would not finance Chadian arms purchases, but might
                            contribute to common pool intended to assist Chad economically. Saudi
                            Arabia, Iran and possibly Jordan could be sources of third country
                            transfers. At the moment France is providing Chad with logistical
                            equipment support and technical assistance. Egypt is giving small arms,
                            ammunition, and spare parts. Gabon has provided an aircraft but, as
                            noted, Gabon has declined to provide more assistance.</p>
                        <p>9. As to possible Saudi financial assistance, Secretary may wish to raise
                            topic during his meetings in Jidda.<note n="5" xml:id="d22fn5"><persName

                        <p>10. In sum, as soon as Chad can find a source of financing some
                            non-lethal equipment (e.g., uniforms, rations) be made available from
                            commercial sources in a matter of three to four weeks. Delivery would
                            probably also require financing.</p>

                            of the United States. Inflationary trends and changes in regional
                            security needs in Africa since Congress enacted the ceiling have
                            required program modifications and waivers of this limitation in recent
                            years. For fiscal year (<gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>) 1977,
                            Congress enacted security assistance legislation based on an Executive

                            was a $6,000,000 program for Ethiopia, which was terminated as a result
                            of events in April 1977.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Justification</p>
                        <p>The recent Angola-supported invasion of the Shaba region of Zaire, the
                            continued Soviet/Cuban presence in Angola, and the continuing flow of
                            Soviet arms into the Congo (Brazzaville) represent a threat to the
                            security and stability of Central Africa. These developments have
                            heightened insecurity in Gabon and in West Africa, where Senegal and
                            Liberia also share borders with Soviet-supported Guinea.</p>
                        <p>The preservation of Zaire’s territorial integrity and the maintenance of
                            security and stability in Central and West Africa are important to the
                            security interests of the United States. To further these interests, the
                            Executive Branch is planning to furnish <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1977 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing
                            totaling:</p>
                        <p>—$28,000,000 to Zaire for the purchase of nonlethal military equipment
                            and supplies required to repel the Shaba invasion and military equipment
                            to improve Zaire’s defensive capability upon the completion of the Shaba
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>—$2,000,000 to assist Gabon’s purchase of one C–130 aircraft and the
                            financing of armored cars.</p>
                        <p>—$8,000,000 to Senegal for the purchase of engineering equipment for its
                            armed forces.</p>
                        <p>—$500,000 to Liberia to improve its modest military capability and
                            support the civic action program conducted by its armed forces.</p>
                        <p>During the past six months, there have also been destabilizing
                            developments in East Africa. Ethiopia’s continued internal instability,
                            its declining relations with Sudan and the United States, its growing
                            ties with the Soviet Union, and the coming independence of Djibouti have
                            fostered an atmosphere of political uncertainty in the region. Kenya
                            remains directly threatened by the forces of Somalia and Uganda, which
                            have superior Soviet equipment. Kenya is also one of the few countries
                            on the east coast of Africa which allows U.S. naval vessels to make port
                            calls. Kenya’s continued pro-Western democratic orientation and
                            continued U.S. naval access to Kenyan ports are important to the
                            protection of U.S. security interests in the Indian Ocean region. To
                            support these security interests, the Executive Branch plans to provide
                            Kenya $15,000,000 in <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1977 <gloss

                        <pb n="45" facs="0066" xml:id="pg_45"/>
                        <p>In North Africa, Morocco and Tunisia respectively occupy strategic
                            positions at the entrance to and along the southern shore of the
                            Mediterranean Sea. They have neighbors whose largely Soviet-supplied
                            military power greatly exceeds their own. Morocco provides U.S. naval
                            vessels access to its ports and has supported recent U.S. efforts to
                            secure peace in the Middle East. Tunisia is a moderate voice in Arab
                            councils, particularly in contrast with its neighbor Libya, which
                            continues to intervene in the affairs of its neighbors. Tunisia also
                            provides units of the U.S. Sixth Fleet with their only regular access to
                            ports on the central southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
                        <p>To advance U.S. security interests in North Africa and the Mediterranean

                        <p>You are asked to find that the sale of defense articles and defense

                            strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.
                            Your finding will assist the United States Government in responding

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>Chad’s request for defense articles and services from the United States
                            results from its unsuccessful efforts to quell an insurgency in northern
                            Chad that has been receiving increased military support from Libya. On
                            July 15, Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName>
                            told the Chadian Vice President that we would assist in restoring Chad’s
                            territorial integrity.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d18fn2">footnote 2, Document 18</ref>.</note> The
                            Government of Chad has requested assistance from other governments as
                            well as the United States to stabilize the situation.</p>
                        <p>I believe it is in our security interest to work with France and other
                            interested governments to ensure that the internal security of Chad does
                            not further deteriorate, and to ensure that Chad can assert control over
                            its territory to the maximum extent possible.</p>
                        <p>If you approve this Determination, we would plan, subject to your
                            agreement, to establish the military supply relationship with Chad on
                            the understanding that it would be designed essentially to meet the
                            current problem and would not be enduring. The principal purpose of your
                            Determination would be to gain the authority to permit third country
                            transfers. However, we would also wish to be in a position to authorize
                            government-to-government sales of equipment which we have indicated to
                            Chad we are prepared to provide. While our strong preference would be
                            for third countries to finance such purchases, we plan to include a
                            small amount of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit for Chad in
                            our preparations for the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979 budget
                            submissions in the event other countries prove unwilling to finance
                            Chad’s military needs.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Legal Considerations</p>
                        <p>Chad is not at present eligible to purchase defense articles and services
                            on a government-to-government basis. Section 3(a)(1) of the Act provides
                            as one of the conditions of eligibility for any foreign country to
                            purchase defense articles or defense services from the United States
                            Government that the President find that such sales will “strengthen the
                            security of the United States and promote world peace.” Authority to
                            make this finding is reserved to the President by Section 1(a) of
                            Executive Order 11958 of January 18, 1977. Section 3(a) of the Act also
                            provides that consent may not be given to the proposed transfer from a
                            third party of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>-origin defense
                            articles or services unless the United States would itself transfer the
                            articles and services in question to the proposed recipient.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other considerations</p>
                        <p>Because the equipment which we would consider for transfer to Chad would
                            be limited in quantity, variety and sophistication, your <pb n="47"
                                facs="0068" xml:id="pg_47"/>determination of eligibility would not
                            be inconsistent with your general arms transfer policy.</p>
                        <p>Chad’s human rights record has improved considerably under the military
                            regime that came to power following the April 1975 coup d’etat. Though
                            arbitrary arrests of suspect guerrillas have occurred, most detainees
                            are quickly either brought to trial or released.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary soundings indicate that we must expect some Congressional
                            opposition to expanding the list of countries eligible for <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> sales in light of your avowed
                            determination to reduce arms sales worldwide. We doubt, however, given
                            the limited nature of any likely sales to Chad, that there will be a
                            major opposition to declaring Chad eligible to purchase defense articles
                            and services from the United States. Although not required by law, we
                            believe notification to Congress and publication of the Determination in
                            the <hi rend="italic">Federal Register</hi> will be helpful in its

                                your government’s willingness to come to the aid of Chad. Since the
                                situation is becoming more and more worrisome because of Libya’s
                                efforts to reinforce its positions with a view to launching new
                                offensives, we would greatly appreciate Your Excellency’s expediting

                            am pleased to inform you that I signed on September 1, 1977, a

                            services from the United States under its foreign military sales
                            program.</p>
                        <p>I have asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG_1">Bradford</persName>
                            to work closely with your government in exploring ways in which we can
                            help meet some of your urgent needs. He will explain the legal and

                        <p>1. Summary: Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> met with Chadian Ambassador to inform him of

                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program (ref A). Chadian Ambassador
                            forcibly stated his disappointment that he could not see President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>, asked when U.S.
                            assistance would arrive, and concluded by saying he thought Chadian Vice
                            President had been offered trucks and fuel on grant basis. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> met
                            with Chadian Ambassador Pierre Toura Gaba on September 9. <gloss
                                target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>/W Director and Chadian Desk Officer
                            attended. Purpose of meeting was to present original of letter from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> (ref B).</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> opened meeting by
                            saying that the President was very occupied with the Panama Canal Treaty
                            and regretted that he could not personally meet the Ambassador as the
                            Ambassador had requested. Noting that Chad, and in a limited sense
                            Egypt, were the only countries made eligible for <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> by the <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> administration, <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> emphasized that this favorable determination was a
                            significant step for the United States. While the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration placed great
                            emphasis on restraining military assistance programs, he said this
                            decision reflected U.S. support for the territorial integrity of African
                            states within their colonial boundaries—a policy which has been
                            reaffirmed in a number of instances, and was in the spirit of earlier
                            assurances to Chadian Vice President Djime. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> said efforts were being made to assure
                            congressional support for the decision.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> noted that under the
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program we could (A) allow the
                            sale of U.S. military goods and services, and (B) permit the transfer
                                <pb n="50" facs="0071" xml:id="pg_50"/>of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-origin goods from other countries. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> noted that both the U.S. and
                            Chad had made preliminary soundings in friendly countries about possible
                            third country transfers. He said Chad should now contact these capitals
                            with specific requests for equipment transfers or financing to purchase
                            equipment under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>. (Later in the
                            conversation, <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> pointed out
                            that, as a matter of policy, the U.S. would not approve of sales or
                            transfer of attack aircraft, helicopters or light tanks.)</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador Toura Gaba thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1"
                                >Moose</persName> for receiving him, but quickly expressed his
                            disappointment that a meeting with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> could not be arranged. The
                            Ambassador admitted that he still had a good deal to learn about U.S.
                            bureaucracy, but noted that he had been waiting several weeks to pass on
                            a message to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName>. He said
                            that this message was short: Chad needed to know when it could expect
                            the U.S. assistance it had been promised.</p>
                        <p>6. The Ambassador said that Libya, supported by “other great powers,” was
                            massing troops and military materiel in the area, and that time was
                            against Chad. He alluded to Chad as a dying patient and said that a good
                            doctor would not expect the proper medicine to be located elsewhere. He
                            noted that <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> Kamougue had
                            visited African capitals to explain the situation and request aid. Yet,
                            for the time being, he said Chad was in urgent need of trucks and
                            gasoline and needed some idea when it could expect them from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> said he sympathized with
                            the Ambassador’s difficulty in securing an appointment with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. However, he was
                            meeting with the Ambassador to make the President’s decision, and our
                            intentions, clear to Chad at the earliest possible date. <gloss
                                target="#t_AF_1">AF</gloss>/W Director pointed out that the recent
                            Presidential Determination is in the spirit of Vice President’s
                            commitment to aid Chad. Referring to Toura Gaba’s use of the word
                            “grant”, he emphasized that grant military assistance was reserved for a
                            small group of traditional U.S. allies. He recommended that Chad begin
                            to search for sources of financing for the purchase of U.S. equipment,
                            said we were prepared to support Chad, and would agree to reasonable
                            requests for sales and approvals of transfers.</p>
                        <p>8. Ambassador Toura Gaba reiterated his disappointment with the limited
                            nature of our assistance. He said that Chad had been expecting at least
                            some grant assistance on trucks and gasoline on the basis of Vice
                            President Djime’s meeting with Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName> last July. He said: quote:
                            Djime had insisted on seeing the President (<persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>), but the President had no time. But he (Djime)
                            was promised—and that promise was repeated by Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName>—that the trucks and gasoline
                            would be forthcoming. Unquote. The Ambassador said Djime and the Chadian
                            Government had since been expecting the trucks and gasoline ASAP.</p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="0072" xml:id="pg_51"/>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> explained that if Chad
                            has expected trucks and gasoline on a grant basis, there had been a
                            serious misunderstanding. Such grant assistance, he said, was not
                            possible. <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> reminded the
                            Ambassador that a special briefing had been arranged for Djime and the
                            Ambassador last July with <gloss target="#t_PM_1">PM</gloss> Deputy
                            Director (Ericson) to avoid any possible misunderstanding of the law. He
                            regretted that there appears to have been a major misunderstanding and
                            repeated that Chad could not rpt not expect any assistance on a grant
                            basis. At the same time, the U.S. would try to assist Chad as much as
                            possible in arranging expeditious purchases or transfers of <gloss

                        <p>10. At this point the Ambassador arose and somewhat regretfully noted
                            that further discussion would achieve little more at this time. He
                            thanked <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> for the extensive

                                <persName corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName> made no specific
                            promises (e.g., trucks or gasoline) in reply to Chadian request for
                            military assistance. Department believes that Ambassador Toura Gaba was
                            mistaken in his memory of the meeting. Ambassador <persName

                            misunderstanding is not widespread in Chadian circles, and assure GOC
                            understands that such direct assistance is not possible. End

                                situation similar to that of the Ogaden. It is because of this
                                situation that we have judged indispensable and necessary to appeal
                                to certain friendly countries such as the United States to help us
                                assure the security and defense of our territorial integrity.”

                        <p>1. Summary: During our conversation at the time of the delivery of the
                            letter to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> (see
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>), President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> made the following points:</p>
                        <p>A) Libyan aggression in northern Chad was being carried out at Soviet
                            instructions; B) while Chad greatly appreciated the assistance we have
                            offered to date, he hoped we would reconsider the matter of helicopters
                            and bombers; and C) he offered to conclude some sort of formal military
                            agreement with the U.S. for training and equipment similar to that in
                            existence with French. I did not comment on Soviet involvement with
                            Libya. I cautioned him that I thought bombers were out of the question,
                            but did agree to re-raise the possibility of helicopters, and I told him
                            in cases like Chad, we seldom enter into a full scale military agreement
                            arrangement but that we would need close cooperation, particularly in
                            training.</p>
                        <p>2. In delivering his letter to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName> again stressed the urgency of the present case,
                            stating that enemy forces were continuing to mass in northern Chad. He
                            went on to explain that in the present circumstance, Libya was merely
                            acting on behalf of the Soviets and the purpose of seizing Tibesti was
                            to outflank Egypt and eventually isolate it. He said that once this was
                            done and these Soviet gains were consolidated with those in the Horn of
                            Africa, Soviet efforts would be turned to a similar isolation of
                            Morocco. He went on to point out that it was strongly in the U.S.
                            interests as well as those of Western Europe and other African states,
                            to halt the Soviet thrust in northern Chad before it gathered momentum.
                            I made no comment on the scenario, but it is clear that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> has talked himself
                            into believing it.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_53"/>
                        <p>3. I took occasion of our interview to re-explain in detail the nature of
                            our proposed assistance to Chad as well as the unusual nature of our
                            entering into a new relationship. President <persName corresp="#p_MF_1"
                                >Malloum</persName> was appreciative of what we were prepared to do
                            and was under no illusion about the nature of our commitment. I
                            particularly pointed out that the nature of our procedures made it
                            impossible for us to undertake any direct grant of military assistance.
                            Despite his appreciation for our proposed program, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> reiterated the Soviet threat to
                            the north and made a strong plea for reconsideration of the inclusion of
                            bombers and helicopters in our program. I told him that I honestly
                            thought bombers were completely out of the question, but that I would
                            re-raise the question of unarmed helicopters with Washington. However,
                            before doing so I wanted to be sure that the French were not prepared to
                            augment their present force [garble—in?] helicopters as it seemed
                            redundant introducing a new type of aircraft into the limited Chadian
                            maintenance scene. <persName corresp="#p_MF_1">Malloum</persName> seemed
                            satisfied with this suggestion but did, however, want to raise both
                            points so that Washington could be giving them further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>4. The President then went on to say that in view of the nature of our
                            new relationship, he wondered if we should not have a military accord
                            similar to that between Chad and France. I told him that normally, in
                            programs such as those on which we were about to embark in Chad, we did
                            not go into a full scale military agreement arrangement. However, I
                            added that close cooperation would be necessary in determining the types
                            of equipment covered and arranging for appropriate training.</p>
                        <p>5. Our meeting was most cordial and President was obviously most
                            appreciative of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s letter and his recent determination on the
                            eligibility of Chad to purchase American equipment.</p>

                            garrison, Faya-Largeau. Over the past three weeks, 40 percent of Chad’s
                            5,000 man army has been killed or captured in the northern fighting.</p>

                        <p>One effect of our intense concentration on Arab-Israeli issues has been
                            to ignore North Africa. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I am
                            concerned that the bureaucracy is operating on a day-to-day basis
                            without any sense of what our broad policy objectives in this region
                            are—apart from the omnipresent goal of “improving relations.” As
                            third-world countries go, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are of
                            considerable interest to us, and we have reasonably good ties with all
                            three. Pressures are mounting, however, to make decisions that could
                            tend to polarize the region unnecessarily, or at least to erode our
                            ability to pursue our interest effectively. Finally, we have invitations
                            pending to <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, <persName

                        <p>Our reluctance to allow the Moroccan Government to use our military
                            equipment in the Sahara and Mauritania in the course of its conflict
                            with the Algerian-backed Polisario guerrillas has resulted in growing
                            estrangement in our historically close relations with Morocco. Meanwhile
                            the Algerian-American rapprochement has lost its momentum due to the
                            resurgence of serious political differences and indications the U.S.
                            will not approve further liquefied natural gas (<gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                >LNG</gloss>) contracts. In Algeria, the Soviet efforts to secure
                            additional naval facilities on <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s
                            southern flank could have some success if there is a sharp deterioration
                            in Algerian-American relations. Morocco and Algeria are engaged in an
                            expensive arms race, and there is the possibility of a direct military
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>As U.S. policy toward the Sahara conflict is central to our present
                            relations with Morocco and Algeria, this paper identifies the core
                            elements of American policy on that dispute and describes two
                            alternative strategies, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
                            These are aligning ourselves more closely with Morocco and more active
                            U.S. promotion of a peaceful settlement. The paper does not assume that
                            our current policy is inadequate, but it does emphasize the strain which
                            has resulted in relations with Morocco as we pursued our present <pb
                                n="59" facs="0080" xml:id="pg_59"/>strategy. It also describes the
                            current impasse with the Moroccans provoked by their use of American
                            arms in the western Sahara and Mauritania and steps underway within the
                            framework of our current policy to overcome this impasse. The paper
                            concludes that regardless of our policy choices it would be desirable to
                            have a high-level U.S. emissary speak with leaders in Rabat and Algiers
                            in the near future.</p>

                            Moroccan dominance in northwest Africa would be preferable to that of

                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> expressed to the

                            been echoed by other Administration officials, including one Cabinet
                            member, in meetings with the King. <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is aware that the President assured Giscard
                            d’Estaing that the U.S. understood the reasons for French military
                            intervention against the Polisario guerrillas in Mauritania. The
                            President has stated publicly U.S. appreciation for Moroccan military
                            assistance to Zaire during the Shaba incursion.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, the Moroccans professed to be astonished by the
                            Administration’s statements to Congressional committees that the
                            Administration recognized Moroccan administrative control but not
                            sovereignty over the western Sahara,<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4"

                            policy since early 1976 (and the policy of Morocco’s other friends in
                            the West). They are bitterly disappointed by the U.S. refusal to sell
                            them arms to be used in the Sahara, and they contrast our position with
                            that of the Soviets who impose no similar restrictions on weapons they
                            furnish the Algerians. They may refuse to withdraw the F–5 aircraft
                            presently in the Sahara and Mauritania in violation of our assistance
                            agreement or refuse to give formal assurances that U.S. weapons will not
                            be used in these areas, thereby perhaps provoking a U.S. arms embargo
                            (affecting both our $45 million <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            credit program and the more than $100 million in planned Moroccan
                            commercial arms purchases) and a major crisis in bilateral
                            relations.</p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_60"/>
                        <p>The Moroccans are also quite concerned by the Administration’s perceived
                            failure to counter effectively Soviet/Cuban intrusions in Africa. While
                            there is self-serving exaggeration in his characterization of the
                            Polisario’s challenge to Moroccan/Mauritanian control of the Sahara as
                            Soviet inspired or manipulated, the King is genuinely alarmed by the
                            propensity of the Soviets generously to support militarily left wing
                            forces in African disputes.</p>
                        <p>Belatedly, the King decided he should take his case directly to the
                            President. Having aborted on three days notice a state visit scheduled
                            to begin December 7 (the fifth such “postponement” in seven years), he
                            unsuccessfully sought a meeting with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> at a time when the President’s
                            schedule was exceptionally busy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impending Discord with Algeria</p>
                        <p>Perhaps to improve its access to the U.S. energy market, and to American
                            technology and finance for the development of Algeria’s hydrocarbon
                            industry, the <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            Government made a number of gestures, e.g., assignment of an Ambassador,
                            intended to normalize relations with the new <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> Administration. Repeated
                            efforts were undertaken to exploit the new Administration’s interest in
                            human rights to win sympathy for the Polisario’s self-determination
                            demands. As relations with France worsened in late 1977 following French
                            military intervention against the Polisario, the Algerians, anxious not
                            to be estranged simultaneously from both Paris and Washington, muted
                            their growing disagreements with the United States on the Middle
                            East.</p>
                        <p>The Algerians also downplayed their frustration at the Department of
                            Energy’s continuing delay in reaching decisions overdue since December
                            31, 1977 on two pending major <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss>
                            import contracts. Although the Algerians probably perceive a political
                            motive, the delay is due to national energy policy considerations. Major
                            factors in DOE’s review of the two cases are their consistency with the
                                <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> import policy being developed
                            by an Interagency Task Force and the draft energy bill, with respect to
                            security of supply, pricing, environment, and other factors. Public oral
                            arguments have been heard in one case, and probably will be heard in the
                            second. No date has been set for final decisions in these cases.</p>
                        <p>Algerian pleasure at U.S. refusal to sell Morocco weapons for use in the
                            Sahara and Mauritania will be overshadowed by resentment, should
                            Algeria’s support for Palestinian and other guerrilla groups expose the
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> Government to the
                            economic sanctions of recent or anticipated American legislation on
                            international terrorism. This is a very real possibility given Algeria’s
                            relations with such organizations and strong Congressional support for
                            legislation which would penalize governments associated with terrorist
                            groups. Earlier this year <pb n="61" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_61"/>the
                            State Department suspended action for two months on Export-Import Bank
                            operations regarding Algeria while examining Algeria’s links to
                            guerrilla groups within the context of current legislation on Exim and
                            terrorism.</p>
                        <p>Algeria maintains extensive contacts with a number of leftist dissident
                            groups and with Palestinians of all persuasion, including Palestinian
                            terrorist groups. Algiers provides some direct support—regular and
                            diplomatic passports, monetary aid, and reportedly some military
                            training—to Spanish and Canary Islands dissidents, the Popular Front for
                            the Liberation of Palestine, and members of Fatah as well as the
                            Polisario. Some known international terrorists, including Carlos, have
                            used Algeria as a transit or stopover point; Carlos is reported to use
                            Algerian passports in some of his travels. Although Algeria has in the
                            past granted airline hijackers safehaven and transit out of the country,
                            it announced earlier this year that it would no longer accept a hijacked
                            airliner unless Algerians were involved or unless asked to do so by a
                            recognized international authority.</p>
                        <p>Finally, U.S. indefinite postponement for administrative reasons of the
                            state visit that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> had
                            been invited to make in mid-1978 can be expected to irritate him.</p>

                        <p>U.S. interests are fundamentally humanitarian, and are distinctly
                            secondary to those in Algeria and Morocco. As the weakest link,
                            Mauritania is bearing the brunt of the war and is dependent on
                            conservative Arab money, Moroccan troops, and French aircraft for its
                            survival. The Mauritanians would like to find a negotiated way out of
                            the conflict that preserves their territory and political integrity, but
                            are too reliant on Morocco to pursue an independent peace settlement

                        <p>There is a curious dichotomy in our national interests along the southern

                            institutions approach $2 billion. U.S. exports to Algeria in 1977

                        <p>Both Algeria and Morocco allow the Soviets to make port calls. These are

                        <p>Soviet arms sales to Algeria are understood to be paid for in hard

                            commercial accounts. The Soviet Union also exports civilian goods to
                            Algeria and provides economic assistance. However, a recently concluded

                            Soviet arms sales and creates a degree of Algerian dependency they hope

                        <p>Soviet relations with the Maghreb are more clearly divided when the
                            issues are regional or global. Although the stridently Third World
                            Algerians sometimes criticize Soviet policies, Algiers and Moscow
                            frequently share views. The Algerians assisted the Soviet/Cuban
                            intervention in Angola by permitting Soviet transport aircraft to refuel
                            and overfly their territory. They have tended to side with the elements
                            backed by the Soviets in the Ogaden and southern Africa. (At the same
                            time, Algeria has apparently strongly cautioned Cuba against becoming
                            involved militarily in Eritrea against Muslim Eritrean liberation
                            elements which have in the past been supported by Algeria, Iraq and Cuba
                            itself. To at least some extent these representations, and those by
                            Iraq, appear to have played a role in inducing the present Cuban
                            restraint.) The Moroccans consistently decry Soviet intervention on the
                            African continent.</p>
                        <p>Again, there is less ambiguity when Soviet relations with the Maghreb are
                            set within the context of Soviet interests in the Arab world. Algeria’s
                            pro-Palestinian militancy and participation in the “steadfastness front”
                            against <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> coincide with
                            Soviet objectives, while Morocco’s advocacy of a peaceful settlement is

                            European, and African nations. U.S. policies will have a negative impact
                            on many of these countries to the extent they are perceived as part of a
                            U.S. “failure” to oppose effectively the growth of Soviet/Cuban military
                            influence in Africa. Morocco has close ties with France and with the
                            other moderate regimes in these regions, e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia,
                            Tunisia, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Zaire. All of these countries share

                            Morocco’s population, have a deep historical and religious basis. The
                            annexation of the territory in February 1976 was the expression of a
                            powerful current of irredentism. In geopolitical terms, the Moroccan
                            leadership viewed the annexation as a means of preventing the creation
                            of a radical Algerian puppet state which would isolate Morocco from the
                            rest of Africa; and the Sahara’s phosphate reserves were seen as
                            important to the country’s economic future.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s dominant personal
                            interests are his continued reign and the perpetuation of the 300-year
                            old Alaouite dynasty. His “recovery” of the Sahara has unified the
                            nation behind him, and he could not surrender the territory without
                            grave risk of a military coup or popular uprising. For the moment the
                            military situation in the Sahara and Mauritania is manageable. But he
                            would be sorely tempted to strike more aggressively at Polisario
                            sanctuaries in Algeria, if the tide of battle turned against his forces.
                            On the other hand, he realizes the danger to his position of a
                            full-scale conflict with the much better armed Algerians, and he is
                            painfully conscious of the growing financial burden of the ongoing
                            guerrilla war. He is ready for a negotiated settlement, but only if it
                            does not call into question the annexation of that portion of the Sahara
                            he now controls.</p>

                            continue to regard the Soviets as sponsors of an ideology obviously
                            alien to his regime and rule. This recognition will not preclude
                            economic cooperation, but in the political sphere his preference will be
                            the West, as long as he believes the West can resist Soviet ambitions.
                            Should he become persuaded the West was going to abandon Africa to these
                            ambitions, he probably would seek a temporizing accommodation with
                            Moscow, hoping the West would rally before he was overthrown.</p>

                            There also is anger with Ould Daddah for his betrayal of their earlier
                            partnership. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> regards
                            the Moroccan monarchy as an offensive anachronism and would be pleased
                            to precipitate the King’s overthrow. Although he denies any Algerian
                            territorial ambition, establishment of a client state would facilitate
                            the export via the Atlantic of southwest Algeria’s mineral resources
                            when and if commercial exploitation proves viable. There is also,
                            however, some truth to <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                            >Boumediene</persName>’s professions of concern for Saharan
                            self-determination which probably evokes a sympathetic response from the
                            more ideological elements of the ruling elite—as opposed to more

                        <p>Although the Algerians have supported <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> consideration of the Sahara dispute, in contrast with
                            the Moroccans, who have quietly sabotaged successive attempts to have it
                            examined under <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> aegis, this
                            presumably was for tactical advantage. Most potential intermediaries who
                            visited both Rabat and Algiers reported the Algerians equally opposed to
                            negotiations. As the costs of the conflict increase, and French support
                            makes a Moroccan/Mauritanian defeat unlikely, the Algerians are perhaps
                            becoming more willing to seek a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>Over the longer term, the Algerians will remain highly nationalistic and
                            reluctant to compromise their non-aligned status by giving the Soviets
                            base rights. But they will cooperate with the Soviets in support of
                            “progressive” Arab and African elements and might eventually grant some
                            additional port privileges if their dependency on Soviet arms increases.
                            The elaboration of their economic ties with the U.S. could modify their
                            propensity to such behavior over the long run.</p>

                            would support any peace initiative they regarded as viable and are

                            interests and the normalization of the bilateral political
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>As the Sahara conflict unfolded in 1975, the Administration believed U.S.
                            interests would be better served by the absorption of the Sahara by
                            Morocco and Mauritania than by the possible creation of an unstable,
                            Arab radical microstate, under Algerian suzerainty, which could be
                            subject to Soviet influence. But the U.S. was reluctant to become very
                            involved and recognized there were previous public U.S. affirmations in
                            the United Nations of the applicability of the principle of
                            self-determination. The U.S. consequently adopted a public posture of
                            neutrality. However, in recognizing the Madrid Accord providing for the
                            transfer of control of the Sahara from Spain to Morocco and Mauritania,
                            and in voting for the pro-Moroccan resolution while abstaining on its

                            fulfilled. Although Morocco and Mauritania have pointed to Saharan

                            self-determination has taken place, the only member of the international
                            community to fully endorse their claim has been the Ivory Coast. The
                            U.S. has said that it would not take a public position on the
                            self-determination question, on the grounds that the <gloss

                            administering authority strongly imply that we are not satisfied that
                            self-determination has yet occurred.</p>

                            Moroccan encouragement, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> avoided
                            action on the issue for two years. The U.S. position did not become a
                            domestic issue until the question of continuing Moroccan use in the
                            Sahara and Mauritania of F–5 aircraft obtained within the framework of
                            the 1960 Moroccan-American military assistance agreement was brought to
                            the attention of Congress. (To prevent use of U.S.-supplied equipment
                            against Israel, that agreement specifies that weapons obtained from the
                            U.S. Government can be used solely for the internal security and
                            protection of the Kingdom of Morocco.)</p>
                        <p>The problem crystallized in autumn of 1977 when the Moroccan Government,
                            after several military reverses by the Polisario, whose Soviet arms
                            inventories had been greatly improved in previous months by the
                            Algerians, requested U.S. authorization to purchase armed reconnaissance
                            aircraft (OV–10) and Cobra helicopters to use in the Sahara and

                            administrative control, i.e., the Sahara, and the territory of nations
                            in the region with which Morocco had defense arrangements, i.e.,
                            Mauritania. At the same time, we noted that we would make clear to the
                            Moroccans that we would continue our policy of “reserving” on the issue

                        <p>There was considerable Congressional opposition to this proposal, led by

                        <p>Currently, the U.S. is seeking redeployment to bases in Morocco of the
                            F–5 aircraft stationed outside the country. The Moroccans also have been
                            asked to give formal assurances that other military equipment purchased
                            in the U.S. will not be used in the Sahara and Mauritania. In addition
                            to legal obligations, the Department of State seeks to preclude a
                            Congressionally imposed arms embargo. Unless or until we change our
                            policy, the F–5s are a key issue, and their use is a major problem for
                            those vocal and influential Congressmen who oppose the use of U.S. arms
                            in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>The Moroccan response is uncertain. Until they can replace the F–5s with
                            French-supplied F–1 aircraft just now coming off the production line,
                            the F–5s will remain the only high performance aircraft in their
                            inventory. With over a third of their army committed to the conflict
                            with the Polisario, the Moroccans want to protect their forces with air
                            power.</p>
                        <p>Pending a response from the Moroccans to these requests, and to offer
                            some protection from Congressional criticism in the interim, the

                                n="70" facs="0091" xml:id="pg_70"/>F–5s and/or to give satisfactory
                            assurances on use of U.S. equipment, we would have to decide if we are
                            obligated to inform the Congress officially that Morocco has violated
                            our agreement. Should this happen, it would further strain
                            Moroccan-American relations.</p>
                        <p>Another element in U.S. policy toward the Sahara dispute has been refusal
                            to play the role of intermediary. This has been suggested by the
                            Algerians, but it is not clear how serious they have been. Informal
                            discussion of their proposal has indicated their actual aspiration may
                            have been to persuade the U.S. to reduce arms deliveries to the
                            Moroccans. An additional motive may have been to sow further doubt in
                            Moroccan minds about the reliability of their ties with the U.S. The
                            formal response to these Algerian suggestions has been that the U.S.
                            wishes to avoid major power involvement and believes African or Arab
                            Governments could more appropriately play this role.</p>
                        <p>To summarize, the key elements of current U.S. strategy are:</p>
                        <p>—No U.S. weapons for Moroccan use in the Sahara or Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>—Suspension of approval for new arms transfers to Morocco pending
                            clarification of Morocco’s position on use of U.S.-furnished weapons in
                            the Sahara and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>—No recognition of Moroccan sovereignty in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—Formal U.S. neutrality on the merits of the Sahara dispute.</p>
                        <p>—No U.S. role in mediation.</p>
                        <p>—Admonishing the Moroccans and the Algerians not to escalate the level of
                            hostilities in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—Refusal to be critical of French military intervention against the
                            Polisario.</p>
                        <p>—Reminding the Algerians of their responsibility to restrain the
                            Polisario from attacking civilian targets in Mauritania and thus
                            provoking French retaliation.</p>
                        <p>—Seeking to expand our energy-related commercial relations with
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>—Building on the above, by being responsive to Algerian desires to expand
                            official relations in the cultural, educational, and agricultural
                            fields.</p>

                        <p>The risk of maintaining present U.S. policy is that an impasse on
                            Moroccan use of American equipment involving continuing inaction on new
                            arms transfer proposals could seriously erode bilateral relations and
                            adversely impact on our relations with other moderate regimes in Africa
                            and the Middle East. It is difficult to quantify this, but certainly we
                            wish to avoid introducing still new complications in the atmosphere and
                            substance of our relations with these countries. As concerns partic<pb
                                n="71" facs="0092" xml:id="pg_71"/>ulars on a bilateral basis, this
                            would be a poor climate in which to press for formal authorization for
                            the <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> deep space tracking facility.
                            Obtaining permission for Sixth Fleet visits might become more difficult.
                            Moroccan positions on Middle Eastern and African issues will remain
                            generally consistent with those of the U.S. But there probably would be
                            a less cooperative response to specific requests for assistance in
                            pursuit of U.S. strategic and diplomatic objectives, particularly when
                            the Moroccans perceive a significant cost involved in their cooperation
                            with us.</p>
                        <p>Of course, a continuing impasse on Moroccan use of American arms is not
                            inevitable. The Moroccans may respond affirmatively to recent urging
                            that they withdraw the F–5s from the Sahara and Mauritania and that they
                            provide suitable assurances regarding the use of <gloss

                            would be a Moroccan assurance that by sometime this fall (when the F–1s
                            may be ready to be deployed), they would withdraw the F–5s. To some
                            extent, such a deal could build on our latest Congressional testimony,
                            in which we made the point that our policy on the F–5s previously had
                            not been made clear to the Moroccans.<note n="9" xml:id="d31fn9"

                        <p>On the assumption that U.S. interests in the Maghreb, as well as in
                            Africa and the Middle East, will be best served by strengthening our
                            relations with Morocco, some of the following initiatives could be
                            undertaken:</p>
                        <p>—Amendment or reinterpretation of our bilateral military assistance
                            agreement to permit use of American weapons in the Sahara and
                            Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>—Subsequent sale of the OV–10, Cobra, and other U.S. weapons without
                            limitation on their use in the Sahara and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>—Recognition of Moroccan and Mauritanian sovereignty in the Sahara,
                            either unilaterally or perhaps in concert with the French and moderate
                            Africans and Middle Easterners.</p>
                        <p>—Accept Moroccan acknowledgment that our F–5s must be withdrawn from
                            Sahara and Mauritania as soon as they can be replaced by operational
                            Mirage F–1s sold by France.</p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_72"/>
                        <p>To minimize the adverse impact of such a strategy on our relations with
                            Algeria, some of the following initiatives would be appropriate:</p>
                        <p>—In return for U.S. support, urge the Moroccans to make concessions which
                            would facilitate a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>—Reschedule the <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> state
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>—Offer U.S. training to Algerian military officers.</p>
                        <p>—Approve sales of selected non-lethal equipment to the Algerian military,
                            e.g., computers and civilian model training aircraft.</p>
                        <p>(Should DOE subsequently approve pending <gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                >LNG</gloss> contracts, these decisions could have a salutary effect

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Constraints</p>
                        <p>Any change in our policies on arms sales and recognition of Moroccan
                            sovereignty would arouse vocal Congressional opposition, probably
                            including introduction of a motion of disapproval, and provoke
                            accusations of bad faith and of violations of the Arms Export Control
                            Act. There also would be some public criticism of the Administration for
                            alleged inconsistency with its human rights and arms restraint policies,
                            as well as claims that recognition of Moroccan sovereignty conflicted
                            with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> charter obligations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effects on U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>On the positive side, such a strategy would restore Moroccan and
                            Mauritanian confidence in the reliability of American cooperation,
                            encouraging continued Moroccan support in the realization of U.S.
                            strategic and diplomatic objectives in the Mediterranean, Africa and the
                            Middle East. One likely immediate benefit would be definitive Moroccan
                            agreement for construction of the <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss>
                            deep space optical tracking station. If and when the Moroccans resolved
                            the Polisario problem, they might be prepared to use their military
                            forces in situations similar to Shaba or Chad, where a moderate regime
                            faced an externally assisted threat. This strategy also would be
                            welcomed by important Middle Eastern, Western European, and African
                            governments friendly to the U.S. There would be voices in the Congress
                            who would be supportive. On the other hand, continuing Moroccan concern
                            about their Algerian frontiers, the limited size of the Moroccan army,
                            and internal political constraints make it unlikely the Moroccans would
                            be able or willing to commit forces in conflicts where they would be
                            likely to suffer substantial casualties, where their involvement might
                            be prolonged, or where they might be defeated. Their availability to
                            deal with possible Cuban forces elsewhere in Africa, therefore, is
                            probably extremely limited.</p>
                        <p>The negative consequences of this strategy would include some
                            deterioration in relations with Algeria, and the possibility of some <pb
                                n="73" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_73"/>Algerian purchases of additional
                            arms to offset acquisitions by Morocco. The Algerians conceivably could
                            retaliate by suspending energy deliveries to U.S. customers, but this
                            would be much more damaging to Algerian interests than to American, as
                            alternative sources are readily available. It certainly would be more
                            difficult to persuade the Algerians to abandon their support for
                            terrorists. U.S. firms probably would be awarded fewer Algerian
                            contracts; few indeed, if Exim financing were unavailable. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> Government could again
                            become openly confrontational and obstructive in international fora. Its
                            dependence on the Soviets might increase, and the Soviets consequently
                            could perhaps obtain greater Algerian assistance provisioning and
                            maintaining their Mediterranean Squadron.</p>
                        <p>Stepped up American support could make the Moroccans less willing to
                            negotiate. There is no guarantee it would enable the Moroccans to defeat
                            the Polisario. It would accentuate the East/West element in the dispute
                            since more significant amounts of U.S. arms would be employed against an
                            adversary armed with Soviet weapons. There would also be some adverse
                            African reaction.</p>

                            possible scenarios:</p>
                        <p>A. Recalling several statements in the past two years in which King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> guardedly expressed
                            willingness to consider further measures of self-determination for the
                            Saharans, we could take the initiative to explore with him or with his
                            counselors the steps the Moroccans would need to take to gain
                            recognition of their “recovery” of the Sahara from favorably disposed
                            countries (Spain, France, and the influential Arabs, as well as the
                            U.S.).</p>
                        <p>B. The U.S. could encourage Arab or African states, singly or in concert,
                            to urge Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria to meet again to discuss their
                            differences. These states might be encouraged to offer their good
                            offices in arranging meetings.</p>
                        <p>C. The U.S. could try to enlist France’s cooperation in encouraging Arab
                            or African offers of good offices. France itself could be asked to use
                            its influence in Rabat, Nouakchott, and Algiers to promote <pb n="74"

                            other governments.)</p>
                        <p>D. The U.S. could encourage <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretary

                        <p>—Establishment of a Mauritanian/Moroccan condominium in the Sahara which
                            would permit internal self-government by the Saharans but leave the

                            relations.</p>
                        <p>—Creation of a federal state in which Morocco and the Sahara, or Morocco,
                            the Sahara, and Mauritania would be constituent parts.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Inducements/Tradeoffs</p>
                        <p>—Moroccan ratification of its border agreement with Algeria recognizing
                            Algerian sovereignty in the Tindouf region.</p>

                        <p>—An agreement on regional economic development with sharing of tasks and

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Constraints</p>
                        <p>The U.S. alone does not have sufficient leverage with any of the
                            governments concerned to pressure them to take steps they are not ready
                            for. The main drawback to the strategy of indirect pressure <pb n="75"
                                facs="0096" xml:id="pg_75"/>described is that every previous attempt
                            to facilitate a negotiated settlement has failed because the positions
                            of the Algerians and Moroccans proved irreconcilable. The Algerians
                            demanded the Saharans be permitted an unfettered exercise in
                            self-determination; and the Moroccans would not allow any
                            self-determination process which would call into question their
                            retention of that portion of the Sahara they have annexed. There also
                            are very difficult practical problems, e.g., authenticating the
                            nationality claims of the area’s nomadic population, the modalities of a
                            plebescite when a large portion of the Saharans are living in
                            Algerian-controlled refugee camps, etc.</p>
                        <p>A more active American role would be inconsistent with our previous
                            reticence about providing good offices. We have a consistent public
                            record of opposing great power involvement of any kind. Some potential
                            intermediaries might be irritated by a U.S. approach to help solve a
                            problem remote to their interests while the U.S. is perceived as
                            responding inadequately to problems of more direct concern to them,
                            e.g., the Saudis and their worries about the Horn and Aden.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Effects on U.S. Interests</p>
                        <p>A durable peace settlement almost certainly would further U.S. interests
                            not only in the Maghreb but elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East.
                            However, a Saharan microstate could become a troublesome radical Arab
                            entity susceptible to Soviet influence.</p>
                        <p>Unsuccessful mediation initiatives in which the U.S. hand were visible
                            could sow further seeds of doubt in Moroccan minds about their
                            relationship with the U.S. On the other hand, if an American initiative
                            had failed due to Algerian intransigence, the Administration might face
                            less Congressional opposition if it subsequently adopted the strategy of
                            a closer alignment with Morocco.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>Whatever strategy or strategies are adopted, the strain in current
                            relations with Morocco, the need to persuade the Algerians that their
                            relations with groups employing terrorism could endanger
                            Algerian-American economic relations, and the postponement of the

                            arguments for the dispatch of a special American envoy who could discuss
                            these issues with leaders in Rabat and Algiers. His position, area
                            experience, and the enthusiasm with which his appointment has been
                            welcomed in Algeria and Morocco uniquely qualify Under Secretary

                            Sahara conflict likely to lead to another Horn of Africa situation.

                            calls into question the kind of balanced posture that has served us well
                            in the past ten years. We should not fall into the simplistic trap of
                            labeling Algeria a “radical” Arab state and thereby placing it in the
                            same category as Iraq, Libya, and South Yemen. Algeria is closer to
                            Syria, in the sense that we have some common interests, the makings of a
                            modest political dialogue, as well as serious disagreements on numerous
                            issues. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, like Assad,
                            is capable of being quite pragmatic and rational and is wary of
                            excessive Soviet influence in his country. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">My conclusion is that we should try to encourage a
                                political settlement of the Sahara conflict through some quiet
                                diplomacy, including frank talks with both <persName

                                begin the process of responding positively to <persName

                            the helicopters will be used until nearer the delivery date. This gives
                            us a little bit of leverage with both sides. With the Moroccans, we
                            could say that we cannot permit use of <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                            decision on the Cobras that a military approach to the Sahara problem is
                            not going to pay off and they might show greater interest in

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>The Policy Review Committee discussed our broad interests in maintaining
                            close relations with Morocco, while at the same time strengthening ties
                            with Algeria. To pursue this course, decisions are required on a number
                            of issues involving our military relationship with Morocco, the dispute
                            in the Sahara, and possible visits by <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> to Washington. (C)</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">F–5s in Mauritania and Sahara</hi>. Morocco
                            undertook in its 1960 military agreement with us not to use
                            U.S.-supplied military equipment outside its own borders. Since we do
                            not recognize Morocco’s annexation of the Western Sahara, the deployment
                            of F–5s to that region is technically in violation of our agreement. We
                            have asked the Moroccans to remove the aircraft and have informed them
                            of our requirement to report to Congress any violations of end-use of
                            U.S.-supplied military equipment. They have not responded. State
                            proposed, and all other agencies concurred, that we should agree to
                            Moroccan use of F–5s in defense of Mauritania, but that we could not
                            permit their use in the Western Sahara. F–5s in the Sahara should be
                            withdrawn as soon as possible. (S)</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sale of Cobras</hi>. Morocco has formally requested
                            24 Cobra helicopters. All agencies recommend that we agree to the sale,
                            subject to the condition that no Cobras would be delivered until the
                            F–5s were withdrawn from the Sahara or the Sahara dispute had been
                            peacefully resolved. Defense suggested that Morocco might be well
                            advised to consider the OV–10 aircraft instead of additional Cobras.
                            (Congress will have the normal period of time to consider these cases.)
                            (S)</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Notification of Congress</hi>. We intend to notify
                            appropriate Congressional committees orally that a technical violation
                            of our bilateral military agreement with Morocco may have taken place.
                            We will explain the steps underway to remove the F–5s from the Sahara
                            and will explain the broader context of trying to promote a peaceful
                            resolution of the Sahara dispute. After further talks with the
                            Moroccans, and a trip by Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> to North Africa, we would formally notify
                            Congress of the Moroccan violation. We want to avoid a sharp negative
                            reaction. (C)</p>

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Sovereignty over Sahara</hi>. It was generally
                            agreed that we should encourage Morocco and Algeria to negotiate a
                            peaceful resolution of this dispute, and that we should urge King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> to adopt a more
                            forthcoming attitude toward carrying out the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolutions calling for consultations with the local
                            population as part of the process of self-determination. It was not felt
                            that we should actively try to mediate the dispute or unilaterally
                            change our position of neutrality on the question of sovereignty over
                            the Sahara. (S)</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Algerian
                                Relations</hi>. Our economic interests are substantial, although
                            these may not continue to develop as rapidly as in the past if two large
                            Algerian <gloss target="#t_LNG_1">LNG</gloss> projects are disapproved,
                            as is anticipated by the Department of Energy. Exim Bank lending remains
                            a significant aspect of our economic relations. Prospective legislation
                            concerning international terrorism could possibly jeopardize those
                            relations if Algeria is considered among those countries supporting
                            terrorism. We have periodically discussed this issue with the Algerians,
                            and a frank talk with <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>
                            would be useful. In addition, we should consider more Presidential
                            correspondence with <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> on
                            substantive issues. (C)</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                    >Hassan</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                    >Boumediene</persName> Visits</hi>. We have little tangible to
                            offer in our political relations with Algeria beyond an invitation to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> to visit

                            Since these visits are directly related, Under Secretary <persName

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David Newsom</persName>, or another senior
                            State Department official, is planning a trip to North Africa in the
                            near future. If you approve, he would discuss the course of action
                            recommended by the PRC with King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>. He would also want to carry substantive
                            letters from you to each of the leaders he will be meeting. The letters
                            are being drafted now. The key passage in each will be an indication
                            about when they could expect to visit Washington. The PRC recommendation
                            is at point 6 of the summary. (S)</p>
                        <p>We will also want to respond soon to the Moroccan request for 24 Cobra
                            helicopters. The PRC’s examination of this issue was an attempt to
                            balance two conflicting aspects of our North Africa policy. First, we
                            wish to contain the expansion of Soviet influence in the area, which
                            means preserving our ties to Algeria to keep it from drifting toward the
                            Soviet camp. At the same time, we want to maintain the very close
                            bilateral relations we have with Morocco. So long as the warfare
                            continues in the Western Sahara, our attempt to maintain a balanced
                            posture is going to be less than satisfactory to both Algeria and
                            Morocco. The recommendation in the second point of the summary is
                            designed to use the sale of the Cobras as a modest incentive for Morocco
                            to pull its F–5s out of the Western Sahara, where they are in violation
                            of our bilateral military cooperation agreement, and to work toward a
                            peaceful settlement of the dispute. If you approve, we would raise this
                            issue with the parties in the next few weeks, possibly during Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>’s trip. (S)</p>

                            I had some other important issue to discuss with him on which my request
                            for a meeting could be pegged. Libyan matter could then be tacked on to
                            general discussion. If Dept has any more positive elements that it wants

                            please let me know in next few days. If not, I will make the demarche

                            subject with Shawkat. There is nothing wrong with having raised it with
                            Shawkat, but doing so is lecturing to the converted. Shawkat has long
                            told us that he is opposed to Libyan venture and his advice to his
                            immediate superiors has been on the impractical nature of such a caper
                            in terms of logistic and other problems. But Shawkat has no direct input

                            Shawkat and <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> Ali have for
                            past several years been competitors in the intelligence purveying
                            business and Shawkat now finds himself in the uncertain position of
                            being subordinate to the man whose estimates he consistently denigrated.
                            In the circumstances, Shawkat is not likely to beard <persName

                            it would seem to me that the simplest thing to do would be for the

                            facilitate any demarche that I make here, since <persName

                                government’s claim to sovereignty in the Sahara, but they blame the
                                Sahara conflict for the economic problems they are encountering. The

                                liberalization measures the King implemented in the past three years
                                have begun to criticize the monarch. Strikes and student protests
                                are becoming more frequent.</p>
                            <p>Since the Tan Tan attack the Government has been forced to stop
                                pretending that it has the military situation in the Sahara under
                                control. Actually there has been no recent sharp deterioration in
                                the situation on the ground. But the Polisario has fought the
                                Moroccans to a stalemate. The guerrillas have established staging
                                bases within the Sahara, and Moroccan control does not extend beyond
                                urban centers. A critical lack of spare parts and hesitant
                                leadership preclude vigorous counterinsurgency measures. A
                                pro-Moroccan coup in Mauritania would make it more difficult for the
                                Polisario to continue to use staging bases in the Mauritanian Sahara
                                to mount attacks against Moroccan forces to the north. But the
                                breakdown of the ceasefire between Mauritania and the Polisario
                                would force the Moroccans to engage again in the active defense of
                                Mauritania. Poor military morale reflects war weariness and
                                frustration at not being able to strike at the Polisario’s
                                sanctuaries in Algeria. Although <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"

                                retrenchment restores Morocco’s economic health.</p>
                            <p>The King feels beleaguered. With characteristic political skill he
                                has turned the Tan Tan attack to his political advantage, forming a
                                National Defense Committee and nominating to it the leader of the
                                principal opposition group. But he recognizes this tactic offers
                                only partial and momentary protection from the rising groundswell of
                                domestic discontent. The King has a propensity for the dramatic
                                which could lead him to decisions as dangerous as an attack on
                                Tindouf, which could make his position ever more insecure.</p>
                            <p>The King feels let down by several of his more important foreign
                                friends. Termination of the Saudi subsidy was a heavy blow. Payment
                                problems have interrupted the flow of French weapons and spare
                                parts. <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> feels the U.S.
                                has been particularly unhelpful. From his perspective our public
                                rejection of his claims to sovereignty in the Sahara (which occurred
                                in response to Congressional inquiries) undermined his diplomatic
                                position. Moroccans feel that our refusal to sell them new weapons
                                to use in the Sahara, while Soviet arms deliveries to the Algerians
                                continue without interruption, has put them at an unfair
                                disadvantage in Morocco’s struggle with the Polisario. As we look to

                            <p>Stated below are several options which the U.S. could implement to
                                take some of the current strain out of our relations with
                                Morocco.</p>

                            <p>The U.S. recognizes that Morocco shares responsibility for
                                administrative control of the Sahara with Mauritania by virtue of
                                the Madrid Accords. The U.S. does not recognize the claims of
                                Morocco and Mauritania to sovereignty in the Sahara, and neither
                                does any other nation. Apart from the British, who are not
                                significant arms suppliers, the U.S. is Morocco’s only arms supplier
                                to insist that the weapons it furnishes not be used to defend the
                                Sahara. This U.S. position has been based on the provisions of the
                                Arms Export Control Act which authorize U.S. sales only for
                                legitimate self-defense and internal security. The U.S.-Moroccan
                                Military Assistance Agreement of 1960, which implements the Act,
                                limits uses of American-furnished weapons to the defense and
                                internal security of the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
                            <p>We have given our permission for the Moroccans to use U.S. weapons

                                they want to purchase anti-tank helicopters. Supplying U.S. military
                                equipment to Morocco would not be likely to end the military
                                stalemate in the Sahara. Its principal benefit would be improved
                                U.S.-Moroccan relations at this time. There is an outside chance

                                state in the Mauritanian Sahara, or perhaps to a supranational

                                itself would give much impetus to a peace process. Any such U.S.
                                offer would have to be coordinated closely with the Moroccans to

                            <p>At one time or another, both Morocco and Algeria have asked us to
                                mediate the Sahara dispute. However, what each state actually had in
                                mind was U.S. pressure on its opponent, and neither appeared ready
                                to make the concessions required for a compromise. We declined to
                                mediate because the basis for agreement seemed absent, and because
                                we thought it preferable to avoid superpower involvement. We also
                                believed various Arab and African governments, as well as the French
                                and the Spanish, were better qualified to serve as mediators.</p>
                            <p>We have given consistent support to the mediation efforts of others.
                                Most recently, we encouraged President Nimeri to exercise the
                                mandate given him by the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, and
                                we voted for a UNGA resolution last fall supporting his efforts. We
                                have told both the French and the Spanish we would collaborate
                                diplomatically in any peace process they might be able to initiate.
                                (The French have not been interested in our cooperation in their
                                abortive efforts, and the Spanish never had been able to get an
                                initiative underway.)</p>
                            <p>Mauritania’s new leaders obviously want an end to the war. They and
                                the Polisario have participated in a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                                ceasefire since July 1978. However, the Mauritanians so far have
                                been unwilling to negotiate a separate peace with the Polisario,
                                realizing this would invite retaliation by their Moroccan allies.

                                the chances for successful mediation are slim. Any offer of
                                mediation would give rise immediately to the question of the
                                Polisario’s participation in the mediation process. Pressure on the

                                peace process efforts. If we gave <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                    >Hassan</persName> unqualified permission to acquire American
                                arms, the Algerians probably would discriminate against U.S. firms
                                in the award of new construction and import contracts. The injury to
                                our economic and commercial interests might be less if we permitted
                                the Moroccans to acquire only new systems of a primarily defensive
                                or transport nature, e.g., sensors or additional C–130s. Any change
                                in U.S. policy on arms would put strain on our political relations
                                with Algeria, which though never intimate, have been improving in
                                recent months. A decision of this nature also could have an
                                unwelcome influence on the foreign policy orientation of Algeria’s
                                new government.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>’s assessment is that Morocco is
                            facing serious problems, largely because of the stagnating economic
                            situation, the continuing Sahara conflict, and the ineffective
                            leadership. These trends may get worse, with serious consequences for
                            U.S.-Moroccan relations. It was agreed that the U.S. has a serious
                            interest in Morocco and in cooperation with King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>. Morocco’s generally moderate
                            stand on Middle East and African issues is a particularly valuable
                            asset. While taking steps <pb n="95" facs="0116" xml:id="pg_95"/>to
                            strengthen U.S.-Moroccan relations, however, we should be mindful of our
                            important economic interests in Algeria and of the fluid leadership
                            situation there.</p>
                        <p>2. The Moroccans have requested $6 million worth of spare parts for the
                            F–5 aircraft. Until now, this package has been held up because of
                            disagreement on the use of the F–5 in the Sahara. All agencies, with the
                            exception of <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>, now believe we
                            should go forward with this request. <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1"
                                >ACDA</gloss>’s dissent is based on the belief that the spare parts
                            will not significantly affect the military situation confronting Morocco
                            and will constitute a technical violation of the U.S.-Moroccan military
                            assistance agreement. Defense and State have determined that the spare
                            parts would not constitute such a violation. Congressional consultations
                            on this case have indicated general support, with the exception of
                            Senator McGovern.</p>
                        <p>3. Defense and <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> will quietly examine
                            other military items which might be of a particular help to the
                            Moroccans in the present circumstances. Defense believes that inadequate
                            communications equipment and surveillance may be the major problems
                            currently confronting the Moroccan forces. Recommendations should be
                            available within several weeks.</p>
                        <p>4. All participants felt that the Sahara conflict could not be resolved
                            militarily. At some point, a political settlement will be essential. It
                            is not clear that the time is right for a settlement, nor is there
                            consensus on what possible role the U.S. might play. Consequently, a
                            small study group will be formed to examine diplomatic strategies for
                            beginning the process of accommodation between Morocco and Algeria
                            concerning the Sahara.<note n="2" xml:id="d38fn2">See <ref

                            Saharan struggle poses serious risks for Spain as well as <gloss

                            Sahara as outstanding international issue in minds Algerians, who
                            regarded it as vital question. He foresaw little possibility Algerians
                            would change their position and noted that while there may have been
                            degrees of personal pique in <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s position, Sahara and Polisario now had

                            importantly, he believes Algerians see Sahara as means to bring about
                            downfall of monarchy in Morocco and hope this will further their goal of
                            asserting hegemony over Maghreb.<note n="7" xml:id="d40fn7">An unknown

                            Austerity measures necessitated by expenditures of Sahara campaign,
                            expense of massive military modernization program, drop in phosphate
                            prices and withdrawal of Saudi subsidy, together with demographic
                            factors, have complicated already pressing economic and social
                                problems.<note n="8" xml:id="d40fn8">An unknown hand underlined
                                “Austerity measures necessitated by expenditures of Sahara

                            created by Green March was showing cracks and speculated that serious
                            military reverses in the Sahara, or abandonment of the Moroccan claim
                            there, could lead to overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and installation of military regime which would
                            be more obstinate than <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> on
                            questions affecting Algeria. He asked if Algerians did not recognize
                            dangers this would pose to their interests, and said that, given
                            Benjedid’s record of pragmatism, he was convinced latter would change
                            Algerian policies on Sahara. If he did not, sooner or later there would
                            be war between Morocco and Algeria, because <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> would fight rather than quit.<note n="9"

                        <p>7. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1">Haynes</persName> said we
                            must not expect Algerians always to react logically, and we should bear
                            in mind that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> had had
                            to restrain Benjedid, then commander of the western military region,
                            from undertaking rash military action against Morocco in 1975 at the
                            time of the Green March.</p>
                        <p>8. Various solutions were discussed, and it was agreed there was little

                                corresp="#p_HUSC_1">Haynes</persName> did not believe this would
                            settle issue, since Polisario would continue attack against Saguia al
                            Hamra from this base. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1"
                                >Parker</persName> noted that this would be much more difficult for
                            sovereign state, than for a provisional government, and pointed out that
                            no Polisario state could function as such in Western Sahara against
                            armed opposition of Morocco. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1"
                                >Todman</persName> remarked that we should not confuse functioning
                            with existence. Provisional government could operate, and be given
                            recognition, even if it did not carry out all the functions of a
                            sovereign state in its own sovereign territory. Coming into being of
                            independent Polisario state might not be inevitable, but it was likely.
                            He was impressed with dynamic qualities Polisario leadership. Ambassador

                            noted that there were already clandestine contacts between Moroccans and
                            Algerians, who knew each other far better than we ever would.<note

                                sentence.</note> He did not think there was any need for a mediator
                            to establish contact or to convey the views of the opposing parties. If
                            the two wanted to meet, they would do so and had no need of outsiders.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> agreed.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName>, however, felt
                            a mediator could play a useful role and might provide a framework to
                            help the parties rise above invective and polemics.<note n="13"

                            He believed the Spanish might like to play such a role. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> noted that his staff
                            doubted Spanish suitability for that role, but agreed they might be
                            wrong.</p>
                        <p>10. The question was raised with Lopez Aguirrebengoa after lunch. He said
                            Spanish would not be able to do it alone.<note n="14" xml:id="d40fn14"

                            was given by Ruperez. At same time, it seems evident Spaniards would
                            like to try the role. Ruperez said, in fact, that Prime Minister’s trip
                            to Algeria and <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss>’s to
                            Nouakchott had been timed to precede Juan Carlos’ trip to Morocco first
                            week in June in hopes they would produce something for latter to say to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> about problem.</p>
                        <p>11. Spanish reiterated their impression Algerians wanted to avoid war but
                            unable to explain why they not showing more interest in peace if that
                            was the case. Lopez Aguirrebengoa claimed Libyans provided 85[%] of
                            financial support received by Polisario and speculated at length on
                            possibility playing on Mauritanian or Saharan elements in Polisario as
                            way to find compromise. Ruperez claimed Polisario position not as hard
                            as it seemed and expressed concern at Cuban connec<pb n="100"

                            representative in Madrid. He advised us to establish direct contact with
                            organization, but he and others denied Spanish had any, other than those
                            maintained by UCD and other parties. Ruperez said Polisario not seeking
                            to bring down <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, whom they
                            regarded as foil to Algerians and whose presence necessary to keep them

                        <p>12. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> thought
                            that King Juan Carlos and the Spanish Government would be watching

                            American friend over the years. Any Spanish perception that we fail to
                            support him in a time of need—as they believe we failed the Shah—would
                            be certain to affect the Spanish view of whether they can count fully on
                            the U.S.<note n="15" xml:id="d40fn15">An unknown hand highlighted this

                        <p>13. Without in any way tilting toward Algeria, our Spanish informants
                            displayed a considerable measure of irritation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> for creating this mess by
                            taking advantage of Spanish preoccupation with the demise of <persName
                                corresp="#p_FF_1">Franco</persName> in the fall of 1975. There was a
                            strong hint in their analysis that the only key to a possible solution
                            involved Mauritania. The Spanish felt that, notwithstanding some
                            assessments to the contrary, the new Mauritanian Government is
                            continuing its behind-the-scenes talks with the Polisario with the
                            probable aim of ceding Tiris al-Gharbia to them as their independent
                            state. In this connection, they feel that the Polisario is acting
                            independently of Algeria.<note n="16" xml:id="d40fn16">An unknown hand
                                underlined “Spanish,” placed a checkmark in the right-hand margin
                                next to the second sentence, and underlined “the new Mauritanian

                                as their independent state” and “Polisario is acting independently

                        <p>14. Oreja said he had just spoken with the Mauritanian Ambassador to
                            Madrid, who is closely related through personal and family ties to the
                            new Mauritanian leadership. The Ambassador had said that the recent
                            change of government in no way represented a change in Mauritania’s
                            policy of seeking peace with the Polisario. The Mauritanian Foreign
                            Minister was to go to Libya at the end of this week and would discuss
                            possible peace moves with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                            >Qadhafi</persName>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1"
                                >Haynes</persName> speculated that he might also have in mind
                            meeting with Polisario representatives in Libya.</p>
                        <p>15. Soviet arms: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1"
                                >Parker</persName> briefed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1"
                                >Haynes</persName> on current intelligence regarding Morocco’s
                            possibly turning to the Soviets for arms. He noted that Moroccans
                            already had more conventional arms than they presently able maintain,
                            and it would not make much sense to turn to the Soviets for more of
                            those, nor would more <pb n="101" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_101"/>of them
                            make much difference in the Sahara. He did not know whether Soviets
                            might be able to supply aircraft which would significantly improve
                            Moroccan capabilities. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1"
                                >Haynes</persName> felt that there was validity in the view
                            expressed to him at the Quai that, given their failure to date to bring
                            Algeria into their orbit, or to get navy facilities there, the Soviets
                            might very well turn to a more vulnerable Morocco as a riper field for
                            exerting its influence in the Maghreb.</p>
                        <p>16. Conclusions: It seems clear that there is little hope of a mediated
                            solution to the Sahara problem if the parties themselves are not ready
                            for it. If it is true that the Algerians are determined to get <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, and are not interested in
                            compromise, and if it looks as though they may succeed, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> will eventually strike at
                            Algeria and the Algerians will respond in kind. Similarly, if the
                            Moroccans are not prepared to make concessions, which they have so far
                            resisted, there seems little possibility of interesting the Polisario.
                            All agreed, however, that we should bear in mind the Arab ability for
                            quick turn-arounds, and that a settlement was not out of the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>17. Meanwhile, unhealthy Moroccan internal situation is likely create
                            pressure on <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> for radical
                            policies in one direction or another, i.e. either to suppress dissent or
                            distract it with international preoccupations. While internal pressures
                            in a sense militate for political settlement of the Sahara problem, they
                            also impose severe limits on the nature of that settlement. The King
                            cannot give up the territory and survive.<note n="17" xml:id="d40fn17"
                                >An unknown hand highlighted this sentence.</note></p>
                        <p>18. Soviet intentions are not clear, but we believe they could very well
                            decide to supply arms to Morocco on liberal terms (a) to embarrass U.S.,
                            (b) to impress the Algerians and (c) to gain a strategic foothold in the
                            region. While this would not mean the death of our republic, it could
                            have serious implications for our military relationship with Morocco and
                            for our broader national security interests in the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>19. Policy: For the time being we should maintain our present posture and
                            watch the players go through their respective acts until such time as we
                            see a well-defined limited-risk role for the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to play that would lead them all to a negotiated
                            settlement. That time has not yet come.</p>
                        <p>20. After considerable discussion, the three Ambassadors agreed that
                            there was an obvious lack of clear policy for North Africa. We feel we
                            are drifting. Some hard decisions must be taken and if they are not
                            taken the consequences for our national interest will be serious. We
                            should decide once and for all what we are going to do about arms <pb
                                n="102" facs="0123" xml:id="pg_102"/>for Morocco. We should decide
                            whether we believe the collapse of the Moroccan position in the Sahara
                            is inevitable. If so we should start making arrangements to establish
                            relations with those who are coming after. Alternatively, if we believe
                            the collapse is avoidable, we should decide how we can support more
                            fully the Moroccan position. In the same vein we should decide how
                            important Algerian oil and natural gas are to us in the face of a
                            worsening American energy crisis and what effect more support for a
                            Moroccan position may have on our access to them. Likewise we should
                            make an urgent determination of whether any one of the countries in
                            North Africa is likely to occupy a position of dominance in the regeion
                            for the foreseeable future and how we protect our interests in that
                            event.</p>

                        <p>—Following an upsurge in Polisario attacks within Morocco’s
                            internationally recognized boundaries, I initiated consultations with
                            the Senate and House in late July.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d176">Document 176</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>—In early August Morocco reacted to Mauritania’s decision to make a
                            separate peace with the Polisario and withdraw from the western Sahara
                            by unilaterally annexing the territory’s former Mauritanian sector.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">See <ref target="#d240">Document
                                240</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>—Meanwhile the Polisario has the military advantage, even though it
                            cannot oust Morocco from the cities in the western Sahara; internal
                            pressures are increasing on <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to find a way out of the impasse (but not one
                            under which Morocco would give up territory); and Morocco finds itself
                            increasingly isolated diplomatically.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">3.</hi> A Strategy for Peace</p>
                        <p>We believe we should continue, as in the past, to take no explicit
                            position on the ultimate nature of the settlement; we would go along
                            with any outcome that was agreed to by all principally concerned
                            parties. Also, while we shall probably want to initiate direct talks
                            with the Polisario at some point, we should not try to reach any
                            conclusion on this until we have thought through our peace strategy in
                            more detail (see below).</p>
                        <p>We should in addition continue to eschew a mediatory role ourselves—on
                            grounds that we are not particularly well-positioned for the role and we
                            already have more than enough U.S. mediating efforts in operation—but we
                            would encourage and support efforts by other interested third parties to
                            bring the principals to the negotiating table. We shall seek to develop
                            a conceptual framework that will strengthen our direct diplomacy, both
                            with the principals and with well-placed third parties, such as Saudi
                            Arabia, France, Spain, and key <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            members.</p>
                        <p>Finally, any change in our arms transfer policy toward Morocco should be
                            designed among other things to mesh with our peace strategy <pb n="104"
                                facs="0125" xml:id="pg_104"/>and strengthen our diplomatic efforts

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">4.</hi> U.S. Arms Transfers to
                            Morocco</p>
                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">First Option: Stand Pat</hi></p>
                        <p>Under this option there would be no change in our present policy of
                            limiting arms transfers to weapons systems that clearly are not suitable
                            for use in the western Sahara. The principal <hi rend="italic"
                                >advantages</hi> of this course are that (i) the U.S. would be
                            widely seen domestically and internationally as keeping in step with the
                            majority that does not support Moroccan occupation of the western Sahara
                            and has recently been disturbed by Morocco’s move into the Mauritanian
                            sector; (ii) there would be no possible disagreement about the
                            consistency of our policy with our 1960 bilateral agreement and U.S.
                            law; (iii) we would avoid giving <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> any grounds for hoping—however erroneously—that
                            with our new weapons systems he might achieve a military victory; and
                            (iv) our relations with the new Algerian Government would be at least
                            unjeopardized and possibly improved. In addition, we would avoid a
                            bruising debate in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>It can be argued, however, that the present policy has ill-served our
                            purposes: (i) although we have tried in recent months to be responsive
                            short of supplying <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> with
                            weapons systems suitable for use in the Sahara, this limitation has cost
                            us much of our credibility or influence with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, and we have gained no
                            perceptible balancing increment of influence with the Algerians; (ii)
                            even more serious, we have contributed to a growing Moroccan sense of
                            international isolation that, added to other frustrations, could in time
                            either force <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> to move
                            rashly against Algeria, or lead to his replacement by a possibly less
                            prudent, as well as less pro-Western regime; (iii) significant forces,
                            both domestic (e.g., Senators Javits and Stone) and foreign
                            (particularly Saudi Arabia and France) are urging us to support Morocco
                            more forthrightly.</p>
                        <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Second Option: Partial Relaxation</hi></p>
                        <p>This would involve some relaxation in our policy strictures but stopping
                            short of the OV–10 (third option), at least for the presently
                            foreseeable future. The guiding principle would be that we would be
                            prepared to be forthcoming, on a case-by-case basis, on weapons systems
                            the Moroccans might request which were not primarily intended (as the
                            OV–10 necessarily would be) for anti-Polisario warfare.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d41fn4">Systems we might consider include the OV–1
                                reconnaissance plane and either the Hughes 500 or the Cobra
                                helicopter equipped with TOW. If this option is selected, we would
                                plan to send a team to Morocco to discuss possible requirements in
                                detail, prior to policy determinations in Washington. [Footnote is

                                this footnote.]</note> Under <pb n="105" facs="0126" xml:id="pg_105"
                            />this policy we would no longer construe Morocco as violating our
                            bilateral if and when it employed such U.S. arms as we were willing to
                            sell it in the western Sahara. Our rationale for this would be based on
                            the need to demonstrate some reaction to recent Polisario attacks within
                            Morocco’s internationally recognized boundaries from Algerian
                            sanctuaries through the western Sahara. We would still not actively help
                            Morocco with its war in the western Sahara, but would indicate to
                            Morocco that, should a negotiated peace settlement be reached, we would
                            then be prepared to cooperate in further strengthening their defense
                            capability in order to ensure their security in a new political
                            environment in the region.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that if this option is to be effective as an adjunct
                            to our peace strategy we shall have to maintain a degree of flexibility
                            as to which weapons systems we consider admissible under it. For
                            example, Polisario cessation of attacks within Morocco proper would
                            undercut the rationale on which the option is based and suggest a more
                            restrictive approach; while Moroccan reasonableness matched by
                            Algerian/Polisario intransigence could necessitate moving toward greater
                            flexibility.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">principal advantage</hi> to this option is that we
                            would retain credible arguments to support our diplomacy in both Rabat
                            and Algiers, as well as with interested third parties. We would of
                            course stress the positive aspects of our policy shift with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> while reaffirming our
                            conviction that in the long run Morocco’s Saharan dilemma could be
                            resolved only through negotiations. We would try to make Algiers see
                            that we cannot remain indifferent to a situation in which Algeria almost
                            without restriction supports, arms, and provides sanctuary to Polisario
                            forces while the U.S. follows a highly restrictive policy damaging to
                            U.S.-Moroccan relations. However, we also would tell the Algerians that
                            despite our historic ties with Morocco we had come down, after intense
                            deliberation, in favor of what was essentially still a policy of
                            considerable restraint. We would ask the Algerians in return to restrain
                            the Polisario and take meaningful steps toward bringing about
                            negotiations; we could also imply that if Algeria failed to take such
                            steps while Morocco did make good faith efforts to negotiate a solution,
                            we might be forced to review our policy again. Similarly, we would
                            indicate to the Moroccans that it was difficult to urge restraint on
                            Algeria unless the Moroccans were displaying convincing signs of
                            flexibility. We would also indicate our support for any reasonable
                            mediation efforts that happened to be underway at the time, consistent
                            of course with our peace strategy as described above.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">principal drawbacks</hi> of this option are: (i) It
                            fully satisfies neither of the interested parties, nor those who
                            advocate U.S. actions along the lines of either Option 1 above or Option
                            3 below. Thus to some <pb n="106" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_106"/>extent it
                            could adversely affect U.S. relations with <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> countries, inhibit development of better relations with
                            Algeria, and even, if mishandled, encourage Moroccan intransigence. On
                            the other hand it could be perceived by the Moroccans as an inadequate
                            response and contribute to a further erosion of our position there; (ii)
                            Any liberalization in our policy at this time is complicated by
                            Morocco’s recent takeover of the former Mauritanian sector. It should be
                            noted, however, that this latter issue is more political than legal. L
                            believes that the legal picture has not changed much (Tab 3).<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d41fn5">Tab 3 is not attached.</note> (We did not recognize
                            the legality of the Moroccan-Mauritanian partition and annexation of the
                            territory in the first place.)</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Third Option: The OV–10</hi></p>
                        <p>For better or worse, this armed reconnaissance aircraft has become the
                            litmus test of our policy review in the eyes of Moroccans and Algerians,
                            and to some extent in the international press and even within the
                            Administration. It is seen as a weapons system well designed for
                            anti-Polisario operations in western Sahara, which is only available
                            from U.S. sources.</p>
                        <p>There is considerable support in certain quarters within the
                            Administration and on the Hill for selling Morocco the OV–10.
                            Internationally, Saudi Arabia, France, and Senegal have strongly urged
                            us to follow this general course. A central concept determining this
                            group’s view is that it is time for the U.S. to demonstrate by actions
                            as well as words that it is willing to help its friends when its help is
                            needed. It has also been argued that the OV–10 could affect the
                            anti-Polisario military effort significantly (though all agree not
                            decisively), thus raising the cost of the war for both the Polisario and
                            Algeria and thereby encouraging them to think in terms of alternatives
                            to total victory.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">principal disadvantages</hi> of this option would
                            be: (i) a major battle on the Hill and considerable domestic and
                                international<note n="6" xml:id="d41fn6">Most Subsaharan African

                                general support the Algeria/Polisario position. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> criticism, augmented by Morocco’s recent takeover
                            of the Mauritanian sector; (ii) Algeria’s leaders would probably take
                            this step as a challenge and our limited ability to reason with them
                            could be further reduced; (iii) Morocco’s position on negotiations might
                            harden because of raised hopes of a military victory; in any case
                            Morocco might stall for the period of months it will take for the first
                            OV–10s to be delivered and deployed, in order to see whether its use
                            might give Morocco a new and significant edge on the battlefield; (iv)
                            the situation on the ground does not indicate that even with the OV–10,
                            military victory would in <pb n="107" facs="0128" xml:id="pg_107"/>fact
                            be close for Morocco; and (v) intensification of U.S. military support
                            for Morocco might produce greater Algerian support for the Polisario, an
                            invitation for support from the Cubans (already hinted at by the
                            Polisario), and a broadening of the conflict.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName></hi> briefly
                            reviewed the context in which the PRC discussion was taking place,
                            emphasizing the two-year deterioration in our bilateral relationship
                            with Morocco and the centrality of the military supply issue. He noted
                            in addition the changed situation produced by Polisario attacks inside
                            Morocco proper which helped precipitate mid-summer consultations with
                            Congress on whether and to what extent we should change our present arms
                            supply policy. Five options—later refined to three—had been discussed at
                            that time, and Congress had warmly welcomed the consultative spirit with
                            which the Department had presented them. At present we face a fourfold
                            problem:</p>
                        <p>1. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, a friend, has
                            staked his future on the Sahara situation.</p>
                        <p>2. We do not wish to jeopardize our interests in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>3. We face a stalemate so far as progress toward a negotiated solution is
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>4. The issue of self-determination for the Sahraoui people is gaining
                            prominence. (C)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> also reviewed the
                            status of Congressional sentiment on North Africa, noting that on the
                            House side there appeared to be support primarily for “Option 1
                            (standpat) with maybe a little bit more”; the House favored maintenance
                            of an essentially restrictive policy on arms sales. On the Senate side,
                            the SFRC voted 7–3 on September 20 in favor of three points:<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d42fn2" type="source">See <ref target="#d177">Document
                                    177</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. should undertake a concerted diplomatic effort toward a
                            negotiated solution.</p>
                        <p>2. We should move rapidly to send a new Ambassador to Rabat who can
                            maintain an effective dialogue with the King.</p>
                        <p>3. We should provide increased military assistance for Morocco but avoid
                            selling weapons designed primarily for counterinsurgency warfare in the
                            desert. (C)</p>
                        <p>In response to <hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                    >Newsom</persName></hi>’s request, <hi rend="italic">Mr.
                                Ames</hi> provided a <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> assessment
                            of <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s position: a) he
                            generally supported Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                            >Saunders</persName>’ presentation; b) the Agency had reviewed pertinent
                            earlier judgments and found them unchanged; c) although there had been
                            serious deterioration in <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                            >Hassan</persName>’s position since the first of the year, he was not
                            yet on a slippery slope (his difficulties derived largely from his
                            unwillingness to address possible solutions); d) the Western Sahara does
                            not mean much to 65 percent of <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s people. (C)</p>

                            questioned this analysis and stated that it runs counter to historical
                            experience. He wanted to know if the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                >CIA</gloss> had a reading from the Moroccan military on our arms
                            policy. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Ames</hi> replied that he had no reading. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName></hi>
                            then asked if there was any evidence that the Moroccan military favored
                            a negotiated solution or a Polisario takeover of the Western Sahara.
                            (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Ames</hi> replied [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] that the military wanted either to “get
                            in or get out”. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName></hi>
                            requested information concerning two other factors: 1) what do we know
                            about the magnitude of the Egyptian supply effort? (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Ames:</hi> Two planeloads of small arms. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>:</hi> And 2) what do we know about Saudi
                            attitudes, both financial and toward the Sahara situation in general?
                            (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Ames:</hi> The Saudis have decided that more money
                            won’t help; they prefer more active mediation. Khalid, coming from
                            Geneva, will stop in both Rabat and Algiers for this purpose. (C)</p>
                        <p>Additional questioning then ensued along the following lines:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>:</hi> What is the impact of all this on <persName

                                >Hassan</persName>’s main problem lies in command-and-control.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. Murray</hi> interjected that while the OV–10s would

                            exist, the Polisario could come from Mauritania. (C)</p>

                            then asked participants to comment on the three arms supply policy
                            options before the PRC: (U)</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Option 1</hi>. (Defended by Mr. Keeny.) <gloss
                                target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> feels that additional equipment
                            won’t win the war for <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>,
                            would merely involve us more intimately with Morocco’s sagging

                            concern. <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> has no problem with the
                            present level of arms transfers but wants to make sure that whatever we

                            that more equipment might encourage <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to be intransigent, thereby protracting the

                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Option 2</hi>. (Defended by <hi rend="italic">Mrs.

                            response to Morocco’s requests while maintaining some restraint. We
                            should seek a balance between Algeria and Morocco, though we would not
                            ourselves want to play a mediatory role. We <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
                            interested in Moroccan defense and would consider supplying additional
                            systems. This means that: we would furnish more spare parts and
                            maintenance for the F–5s; we would view the presence of F–5s in the
                            Sahara as only a technical violation of our bilateral; we would inform
                            Algeria that we are not indifferent to Morocco’s need and would urge
                            Algerian restraint on the Polisario; we would urge Saudi Arabia to play
                            a more active role; we would institute no contacts with the Polisario;
                            we would tell the Moroccans that we do not see a military solution in
                            the Sahara (we would consult with France, Spain, and others). (C)</p>

                            the issue involves a very close judgment call. On balance, however,

                            described the technical advantages of the OV–10 aircraft, including
                            recce and night-flying capabilities. The OV–10 would not be a decisive
                            factor militarily, but at the same time it is important not to diminish
                            its potential. (C)</p>

                            stated his view that with no prospect of a negotiated solution and with
                            little likelihood of military assistance changing the outcome, we really
                            have only two options: either we stick with our present policy, or even
                            less—taking the heat while hoping that this high-risk course might
                            convince <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> to negotiate—or
                            we move to Option 3. (C)</p>

                        <p>1. (S) Entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. Summary: In September 26 discussion with the Secretary, Moroccan
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> asked
                            for U.S. support, asserting that threat to Morocco was broadening.
                            International Communism, he said, is now actively seeking to penetrate
                            region, exploiting Western Sahara dispute to destabilize Morocco. The
                            Secretary informed <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> that
                            he was consulting with countries interested in Western Sahara dispute.
                            During October we hoped to conclude our military supply policy review,
                            and would let the Moroccans know the results. He noted that we had
                            received congressional views, with the House of Representatives coming
                            down less positively than the Senate. Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> added that our policy review is
                            not exclusively concerned with arms supply policy but also with issue of
                            how U.S. and others can contribute to long term stability in region. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Moroccan Foreign Minister called on Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> in New York September 26 for
                            annual bilateral consultation. Ambassador to the U.S. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Ali Bengelloun</persName> attended from Moroccan
                            side; Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_AFN_1">AFN</gloss> Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> and interpreter, from U.S. side.
                            After initial courtesies, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> said he wanted to talk about the serious
                            problem Morocco faces. Morocco regards U.S. as a friend and ally it can
                            rely on. There must continue to be a special relationship between the
                            two countries. Morocco is being tested in the Sahara and the scope <pb
                                n="113" facs="0134" xml:id="pg_113"/>of the danger has increased. It
                            is no longer Algeria versus Morocco, but more a matter of a policy
                            designed elsewhere and being carried out in the region through Communist
                            penetration. Morocco is defending the same values as its ally and
                            neighbor America. Morocco wants the Secretary and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> to know how serious the
                            situation has recently become. Morocco must know that it can count on
                            U.S. support. Our relations are good but “we sense a hesitation or
                            reticence and we would like to dispel your hesitation”. Morocco has made
                            some proposals for purchase of certain equipment and hopes that all
                            differences will be set aside.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> replied that
                            the U.S. has been and remains Morocco’s staunch friend and ally. We have
                            been following events with care, especially Morocco’s relations with
                            Algeria and the situation in the Western Sahara. The U.S. has noted
                            action by Mauritania and the Moroccan action that followed. We would
                            like the Foreign Minister’s assessment: How do you view the current
                            situation? What are Algeria’s current objectives? What is the situation
                            on the ground in the Sahara? And how do you see the situation developing
                            in the period immediately ahead?</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>, in reply, said that
                            situation at present is that the Algerian factor is being overtaken. A
                            couple of days ago <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> sent
                            a letter to the Secretary<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">Not found.</note>
                            noting that Secretaries General of the Communist Parties of France,
                            Spain, and Italy are meeting in Madrid. The other side gets Soviet arms
                            “to the limit”. Meanwhile, Algeria still maintains publicly that the
                            problem only concerns the Sahara people, not Algeria. This is not true.
                            The question is whether Morocco will resist, or become “destabilized”,
                            as Mauritania was. The Moroccan people stand firmly around the King and
                            will resist Communist efforts to destabilize the region to the end.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asked how the
                            Foreign Minister saw this tendency manifesting itself on the ground.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> replied that
                            beginning in June there was a significant escalation of sneak attacks
                            within Morocco’s former boundaries. Morocco was adapting to the new
                            situation. The arms that it had were not suited for this kind of task.
                            However, the Moroccan Army was becoming more “operational”. It was also
                            getting more “weight” now that 10,000 soldiers formerly positioned in
                            Mauritania, and the troops it had had in Zaire, had returned to Morocco.
                            However, there remains the question of supply. The question of military
                            equipment was vital.</p>
                        <p>7. In Mauritania, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            continued, there are a number of pro-Polisario and pro-Communist
                            activists supported by Algeria, Libya <pb n="114" facs="0135"
                                xml:id="pg_114"/>and the Iraqi Baathists. They are trying to
                            influence the Mauritanians who see their country’s interests as
                            requiring constructive relations with Morocco. The Mauritanian Foreign
                            Minister will tell you about this privately, and about the need to help
                            Morocco in order to help Mauritania—even though he can’t say this
                            publicly.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary asked whether <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> believed the Algerians were trying to
                            destabilize or overthrow the Government of Morocco or was that perhaps
                            overtaken too. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> replied
                            that as an issue that was overtaken, the Communist attempt through
                            destabilization of Morocco to extend their influence over the whole
                            region was now the issue. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> then mentioned the Tunisian invitation to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> to get together in Tunisia.
                            The Secretary said that the Tunisian Foreign Minister had just told him
                            about the negative Algerian reply.<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">No record
                                of <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s meeting with
                                Tunisian Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                    >Chatty</persName> was found. The Algerian reply was reported in
                                telegram 7304 from Tunis, September 17. (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D790424–1010)</note></p>
                        <p>9. The Secretary then said he wanted to tell <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> where the U.S. stood at present regarding its
                            policy review, which included the subjects of the OV–10 and armed
                            helicopters. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had done a great
                            deal of work in connection with its policy review. At present the
                            Secretary was consulting with various interested third parties as well
                            as with the Moroccans and Algerians in talks such as these. After next
                            week there would be another interagency meeting at which all the
                            evidence would be reviewed. Some time in October, therefore, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would come to a conclusion. Meanwhile,
                            the House and the Senate have also looked into the situation and
                            provided their views. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            said he hoped that the congressional views were positive. The Secretary
                            said that one House was more positive than the other: the House of
                            Representatives was less positive, though split.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said Morocco must
                            count on U.S. for physical and moral support. We saw what happened at
                            Monrovia and Havana, where a Communist bloc animated the majority and
                            carried with it many others of different persuasions. In view of these
                            developments, King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has
                            worked out a diplomatic plan which he has embodied in a letter he has
                            sent to the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. His
                            proposal would involve all the states bordering on the Sahara, North and
                            South, including Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and
                            Chad. The basic objective would be to convert this Sahara region from
                            zone of conflict to a zone of development and peace—and thereby to
                            oppose the Communist effort to penetrate and occupy it.</p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="0136" xml:id="pg_115"/>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> noted that our current
                            policy review is not exclusively concerned with arms supply but also
                            with the issue of how the U.S. and others can contribute to long-term
                            stability in the region. The U.S. wants to discuss how the international
                            community can contribute to a peaceful settlement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> agreed that this aspect was
                            very important and briefly mentioned Spain. Spain, he said, is going
                            through a difficult period. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> saw the Spanish Foreign Minister earlier that
                            day and asked him three questions: (a) Knowing Moroccans as you do, and
                            knowing that all Moroccans support the King’s policy on the Sahara, do
                            you really think that Morocco can be expected to give up the region? (b)
                            Strictly in terms of Spain’s own interests, is a Moroccan presence there
                            better or worse than some other presence? (c) When the development of
                            the region gets into full gear, should it be with the participation of
                            Spain, or of others? <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            then told the Secretary he believed firmly that if the Spaniards would
                            cooperate, and also the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, the four together in
                            partnership could do great things with the Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary said he had also talked to the Spanish as well as the
                            French about the Western Sahara.<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d42fn4">footnote 4, Document 42</ref>.</note> He then
                            recapitulated, stating that when our review was completed we would let
                            the Moroccans know.</p>
                        <p>13. As meeting was ending, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> noted that Morocco wanted to improve its
                            relations with certain Sub-Saharan states, particularly Nigeria and
                            Liberia. He hoped the U.S. could put in a good word to help this process
                            along, especially with Liberia. He noted that Tolbert had made a
                            moderate and conciliatory speech in the General Assembly shortly
                            before.</p>

                                Foreign Policy File, D790499–0331)</note> The underlying thrust of
                            your meeting should be that the U.S. is considering its various policy
                            options, not simply on arms but on all facets of the Saharan issue, and
                            needs to understand the Algerian position fully. We want you to describe
                            our evolving thinking and to probe the Algerians as to how far they
                            would go to get the process started that could eventually lead to a
                            negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>3. Following are talking points for use with Algerian Government:</p>
                        <p>A. As you know, the United States is reviewing its policies with respect
                            to northwest Africa. In this connection we wish the views of the nations
                            of the region. We attach particular importance to the views of
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>B. Ever since Algeria became independent we have sought to maintain a
                            balanced relationship between Morocco and Algeria, despite frequent
                            tensions between the two countries. We consider our evolving
                            relationship with Algeria important. At the same time, we have had a
                            very good relationship with Morocco over the years.</p>
                        <p>C. The general peace and stability of the area is threatened by the
                            Saharan conflict. The U.S. shares the view of many that an early
                            solution <pb n="117" facs="0138" xml:id="pg_117"/>is desirable. We do
                            not wish to be centrally involved in these efforts, but attitudes toward
                            a settlement are important to us as we consider our own policies toward
                            the individual countries of the area.</p>
                        <p>D. While we remain openminded as regards the determination of the final
                            status of the Saharan territories, we believe that no time should be
                            lost in moving towards a negotiated resolution of the Saharan issue.
                            Virtually everyone is in agreement that the continuing conflict is in no
                            one’s long-term interest.</p>
                        <p>E. This bloody conflict could continue for a lengthy period, and the
                            risks of wider conflict would continue to grow. Increasingly, we have
                            come to the conclusion that the conflict will not repeat not be solved
                            by military action alone. No side, including the Polisario, has the
                            capacity to win a military victory.</p>
                        <p>F. Algeria has provided arms, sanctuary, and political support to the
                            Polisario. In a real sense, therefore, Algeria is a party to the dispute
                            and, in any case, has the means to influence the outcome of a negotiated
                            solution through its relationship with the Polisario.</p>
                        <p>G. The U.S. has a deep interest in Morocco’s stability, its security, and
                            its economic and social development. We intend to maintain a military
                            supply relationship. In this connection we have sought to carry out a
                            balanced policy of restraint.</p>
                        <p>H. This year’s heavy attacks by Polisario forces on Moroccan forces deep
                            inside the sovereign borders of Morocco have changed the situation
                            significantly. This has increased Moroccan concern that Algeria intends
                            to use the Saharan conflict to topple the <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> regime. While we have made no final decisions, we
                            must take into account the fact that Morocco has every legitimate right
                            to defend itself within its territories which are not repeat not in
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>I. We have not repeat not undertaken a mediatory role in this dispute,
                            but we believe that third parties with an interest in resolving the
                            conflict in a fair and equitable way should receive a sympathetic and
                            cooperative response. To some degree France, Spain, Tunisia, Saudi
                            Arabia, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and certain African
                            states have displayed interest in accelerating movements towards a
                            negotiated settlement of the issue. We support these efforts in
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>J. Virtually all such efforts started with a common premise: That Algeria
                            and Morocco should meet at a high level. The Algerian response generally
                            has been that Morocco should deal directly with the Polisario. For the
                            purpose of determining our policy in the period ahead, we would like to
                            know whether Algeria could consider a meeting with Morocco devoted
                            exclusively to the issue of improved relationships between these two
                            countries, but without excluding the possibility that representatives of
                            the Polisario could be brought into the dialogue as it progresses.</p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="0139" xml:id="pg_118"/>
                        <p>K. It would also be extremely helpful to us if we could understand
                            precisely the Algerian position towards the regime of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>. We have heard several
                            descriptions of Algerian policy in this regard. One is that Algeria
                            would prefer that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            continue to lead his country. Another variation, however, of this
                            position is that Algeria believes that King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> is sure to leave the scene at some future point
                            in any event and that Algeria is confident it will be able to deal
                            effectively with any successor government.</p>
                        <p>L. We are posing these very serious questions to Algeria because we are
                            concerned at the evolving pattern of developments which, if unchecked,
                            could lead to instability and further tension in the region. This would
                            be in the interest of no repeat no one who views responsibly the
                            important position of this region in the world.</p>

                            willing to participate in effort to work one out. He stressed that

                            hoped for further meetings in coming months to permit discussions in
                            greater depth. Secretary agreed and suggested present meeting begin with

                                >GOA</gloss>’s current view of West Sahara issue? What were its
                            thoughts regarding possible solutions?</p>
                        <p>4. Benyahia replied at length: The <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            operated on the “golden rule” that all states recognized the boundaries
                            established in the colonial era; to do otherwise would destabilize the
                            entire continent. By now all the ex-colonies had achieved political
                            independence except the Spanish Sahara—why not it? One could overlook
                            the “golden rule” if the inhabitants had chosen to be attached to
                            Morocco or Mauritania but this had not happened and subsequent events
                            showed the inhabitants did not want to be joined to Morocco. Morocco
                            raises historical arguments, conceives of itself as an imperial nation
                            with territorial claims that include a third of Algeria, parts of Mali
                            extending to Timbuktu, and all of Mauritania as well as Western Sahara.
                            Impossible to tell where this will lead, if this logic is accepted.
                            Things being what they are, Morocco has signed a border agreement with
                            Algeria, recognized Mauritania, and is laying no claims on Mali. In 1975
                            when Morocco incorrectly claimed the Spanish had transferred sovereignty
                            to it under the Madrid Agreement it also declared that it had achieved
                            its legitimate borders, but later it expanded its territorial claims
                            when it took over the Mauritanian portion of the territory. Morocco is
                            one of those rare countries where one doesn’t know where its borders end
                            or begin. The problems this poses are rendered particularly serious
                            since Morocco asserts its claims by force not through a process of
                            self-determination. Algeria sees the Western Sahara problem as an issue
                            of decolonization that has not been resolved and can only be resolved
                            through a process of self-determination. Algeria has no claims of its
                            own to any part of the territory. In his press conference <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> offered to open ports to
                            Algeria and generally implied a willingness to share the territory with
                            Algeria, but Algeria will stick to its established borders; there is no
                            question of its negotiating with Morocco on any such “sharing” basis.
                            Furthermore, Algeria cannot construe the problem as <pb n="120"
                                facs="0141" xml:id="pg_120"/>a bilateral one between it and Morocco,
                            as it basically is between Morocco and the inhabitants of the territory,
                            and a settlement has to be between those two. Nevertheless, Algeria
                            recognizes that it has certain interests in the conflict: first, it is
                            taking place on Algeria’s border and could lead to a regional war; and
                            second, Morocco charges Algeria, correctly, with providing material
                            support—as to other African countries. But the Polisario is an
                            independent movement, not a creature of the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1"
                                >GOA</gloss>; it was created during the Spanish occupation, well
                            before 1975, and not in Algiers. The Polisario has proclaimed the SDAR
                            which has been recognized by 32 governments.<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3"

                            Algeria exclude the Polisario in negotiating the fate of the territory
                            with Morocco? How could it explain such action to the 32 governments
                            that have recognized the SDAR?</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary said <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> was not taking
                            sides in dispute. We value our relations with both Algeria and Morocco
                            highly and want those relations strengthened. Western Sahara dispute is
                            a danger to entire region. Continuation of conflict is in no one’s
                            interest. As a practical matter, and notwithstanding Algerian position
                            that issue is mainly between Morocco and Western Saharan inhabitants,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> does not see how a negotiated
                            solution is possible unless Algeria helps. As friend of both Algeria and
                            Morocco, we would like to urge Algeria to discuss issue with Morocco—and
                            to extent it proves necessary, desirable, and helpful, other parties
                            might be brought into the discussion. Otherwise, if Algeria insists on
                            standing apart while advising Moroccans and Saharouis to discuss problem
                            directly, the situation will just get more dangerous.</p>
                        <p>6. Benyahia said his government’s assessment of the situation was very
                            similar. Conflict does affect stability of region as a whole. No
                            military solution was possible, so question was what approach, what
                            mechanism should interested parties have recourse to. He thought his
                            government would be ready to participate in helping find a political
                            solution, drawing on “creative imagination” of concerned parties to
                            ensure that final settlement took account of interests of both sides. In
                            his opinion, Benyahia continued, <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            approach responded fairly well to all these concerns. The Monrovia

                            deterioration of situation, but sees it in its interest to get a
                            peaceful solution. Problem is not at all a matter of ideological
                            conflict between Moroccan and Algerian political and social systems. As
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> sees it, issue is purely a
                            national liberation struggle by a small country that wants its
                            independence. This has nothing to do with character of Moroccan regime.
                            Algeria was on very good terms with that regime until 1975. It is true
                            that in Ben Bella’s time there were attempts to destabilize
                            Morocco—training personnel in Algeria to go back to Morocco to stir up
                            trouble—but since June 1965, <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> has
                            pursued constant policy toward Morocco of friendship and
                            non-intervention. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was

                            Libyans were waging propaganda war against him. There was never any
                            proof Algerians had anything to do with either that attempt or the one a
                            year later. Indeed, <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> feels that from
                            its point of view <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> is “the
                            only pragmatic interlocutor for Morocco”. Algeria continues to believe
                            this but fears current situation could lead to destabilization in
                            Morocco. Secretary interjected that he agreed. Benyahia continued:
                            Chances of such destabilization occurring are growing over time. Algeria
                            does not want destabilization of Morocco for two fundamental reasons.
                            First, any government that might succeed <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> will use demagoguery and play on Sahara theme to
                            gain popularity. Second, destabilizing <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> could lead to string of coups and chronic
                            instability; Algeria did not want to have adventurous regime like
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s on its western
                            border. Algeria prefers to have a wise man in charge with whom it can
                            talk pragmatically.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary apologized that time had run out and meeting would have to
                            adjourn. He regretted not having had opportunity to discuss bilateral
                            issues but looked forward to talking to Algeria’s new Ambassador in
                            Washington, Redha Malek, who had just arrived.</p>

                            objectives, and the latest Saudi request that we supply arms to Morocco

                                reported: “Naif stated that in view of the serious situation facing

                                this will not be possible without full U.S. assistance. What the

                                is willing in principle to furnish military equipment to Morocco in
                                an expeditious manner (i.e. including from U.S. stocks).” (Carter

                            strengthen Morocco’s military position vis-a-vis the Polisario; only

                        <p>The immediate questions are whether we should do something in concert
                            with the Saudis to show support for <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>, and whether we should openly support <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> First Option:
                            Continuation of Existing Policy</p>
                        <p>While we have not supported <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s objectives in the Sahara, we have over the past
                            year acted positively on several Moroccan requests for equipment not
                            precluded under the existing, restrictive policy. There are other items
                            we could sell, such as additional tanks, which would enhance Morocco’s
                            ability to defend itself against a conventional attack from Algeria, but
                            these are not high on Morocco’s list of priorities when it is so heavily
                            engaged against the Polisario. Moreover, Saudi financing could be
                            necessary for some purchases, and the Saudis would probably not be
                            interested if <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> was not. In
                            short, there is more we could do under this option to show support for
                            Morocco, but we might have to finance it ourselves, and neither Morocco
                            nor the Saudis would consider it particularly helpful.<note n="17"

                                >Hassan</persName>’s objectives in the Sahara. We would still pursue
                            the actions described under option one to strengthen Morocco’s defense
                            against a conventional Algerian attack, mindful that the Saudis do not
                            share our distinction between military supply for use to defend Morocco
                            versus supply for prosecution of the war against the Polisario in the
                            western Sahara. We would exchange with the Saudis assessments of the
                            domestic political and the military situations facing <pb n="126"
                                facs="0147" xml:id="pg_126"/><persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>. We would want to be sure that they understand
                            our concern that the war is not winnable militarily and that additional
                            equipment will have at best only a marginal effect on the fighting. We
                            could emphasize the difference between support for <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> and support for his Saharan
                            objectives, and we could raise the possibility of increased Saudi
                            economic aid to Morocco. With this assessment as a background we would
                            press for further Saudi efforts to facilitate a negotiated solution,
                            making clear to the Saudis that we believe such a solution will require
                            significant Moroccan as well as Algerian/Polisario concessions. Assuming
                            the Saudis are willing to undertake such an effort, we would consider on
                            a case by case basis proposals that go beyond those in option one but
                            not going as far as to associate ourselves explicitly with Moroccan
                            objectives in the Sahara. We would explain to the Moroccans that our
                            position on the sovereignty issue remained unchanged, that no military
                            solution was possible, and that it was incumbent on all concerned to
                            work for a negotiated settlement. We would also intensify our
                            consultations with Algeria, France, Spain, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> and other parties. In this regard we might consider a
                            fresh <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> effort as suggested by
                            Liberian Foreign Minister Dennis.</p>
                        <p>We would have to discuss with the Saudis and with the Moroccans specific
                            actions to be considered under the case by case approach. These might
                            include supply of items as indicated on pages 4 and 5 of the discussion
                            paper at Tab A. However, both the Moroccans and Saudis would presumably
                            want to give more priority to equipment and training that would have an
                            effect in the Sahara in the short term, i.e. in about six months. Some
                            examples are contained in the upper two thirds of the list at Tab

                        <p>Principal arguments for and against this option remain as stated in Tab
                            A, with the added point that we now have an important Saudi interest in
                            a shift in U.S. military supply policy but also recognizing that this
                            option may not go far enough to satisfy the Saudis.</p>

                            since we all agree this is not possible. We would remain committed to
                            our present position on the sovereignty issue and on the need for a
                            negotiated solution. However, by providing equipment and training
                            primarily suited for the kind of war Morocco is waging against the
                            Polisario, we would associate ourselves more explicitly with <persName

                            than continuing to seek a military victory. The Saudis would clearly
                            prefer this option.<note n="20" xml:id="d46fn20">An unknown hand

                        <p>Here again, the basic arguments are as stated in the discussion paper at
                            Tab A. For more immediate impact than items such as the OV–10 aircraft
                            would have, we might provide some training and equipment listed at the
                            bottom of the table at Tab D. (While any increase in U.S. presence would
                            be sensitive, counterinsurgency training would be particularly
                            touchy.)</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName></hi> opened the meeting by noting that the
                            participants were essentially down to three choices, continuance of our
                            present policy, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> going all the way to help
                            Morocco, including the sale of OV–10 aircraft and Cobra helicopters, <hi
                                rend="italic">or</hi> some step in between. He briefly reviewed his
                            UNGA consultations in New York and noted the Saudi demarche calling for
                            bilateral cooperation with us on assisting Morocco militarily, a recent
                            and significant development. Whatever we did, we would have to tell King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> that we saw no
                            prospect of a military solution and that he should get on with a
                            negotiated settlement. The Secretary then solicited views around the
                            table and asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            to lead off. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> said he leaned to the view that
                            continued deterioration in Morocco’s military situation will not improve
                            conditions for a negotiated settlement. Our experience with the
                            Egyptians and the Israelis had demonstrated that we were more likely to
                            move disputants to a negotiating process if both sides felt confident in
                            their strength and stability. This was not now the case for Morocco.
                            Moreover, our record in supporting our friends, or the <hi rend="italic"
                                >perception</hi> of that record—which is what counts in foreign
                            affairs—is ambiguous. All things considered, he favored cutting the
                            Gordian knot and supplying Morocco with what it needed to bolster its
                            military position, which would in turn enable Morocco to negotiate from
                            strength. As far as Algeria is concerned, we should not be shy in
                            telling them that we do not believe a weak, unstable Morocco is in our
                            interest. At the same time, we can honestly tell them that we favor a
                            negotiated settlement and are putting pressure on <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> for that purpose. We should, in
                            sum, act like a big and strong country should act. (S)</p>
                        <p>Speaking for the <gloss target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss>, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Deputy Secretary Claytor</hi> said that he had discussed the
                            situation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName>
                            and both believed that we had to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s position. Defense was in essential agreement
                            with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s view and
                            felt that any other course would risk destabilization in a strategic
                            part of North Africa. Defense also agreed with the need to tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> that he had to
                            negotiate. One way to ensure that he did might be to give him part of an
                            arms supply package now and withhold the rest until we had evidence that
                            he was actively pursuing a negotiated settlement. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Admiral Hayward</hi> noted that the <gloss

                            expressed pessimism about inducing <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to negotiate, a) because the King thinks he has
                            to have military success, and b) because there is a “wave of enthusiasm”
                            among loyalist officers for improving <pb n="129" facs="0150"

                            greater fighting effectiveness. Director <persName corresp="#p_TS_1"
                                >Turner</persName> added that we ought not to overlook the
                            Polisario; in other words, we may want to try to play both sides of the
                            street. (S)</p>
                        <p>Summarizing <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>’s preference for
                            sticking to our present policy, <hi rend="italic">Mr. Keeny</hi> said
                            that liberalization risked protracting and perhaps escalating the
                            conflict. It would send a wrong signal to Morocco and complicate our
                            life with both Algeria and Congress. In response to Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s query concerning the
                            source of Congressional opposition to a changed policy, Mr. Keeny noted
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1">Steve Solarz</persName> was out in
                            front. Losing a confrontation with him and other members of Congress
                            would not help us with our friends.<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">An

                            which favored a partial relaxation of our present policy to include
                            items which would not incur Congressional opposition (replacements, for
                            example, for all eight F–5s lost by Morocco). Supporting Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s contention that
                            Congressional sentiment was a key factor which had to be put on the
                            table, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that we
                            faced a real fight in the House and no strong endorsement in the Senate.
                            The OV–10 had become a symbol and as such could give us trouble not only
                            with Congress but with Algeria. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> replied that it would be nice if we
                            could please everybody; yet in the real world we cannot. We must choose,
                            and if it is a question between pleasing Algeria and pleasing Saudi
                            Arabia, there was no doubt in his mind where the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> national interest lay. Moreover, we have to ask
                            ourselves how we will look in that part of the world if <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> falls. <persName

                            as a human being or otherwise. Yet he has been our friend. And our track
                            record in support of our friends is not reassuring. (S)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName></hi> then summed up his own position, emphasizing
                            that we have to support <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            but that we would have great trouble getting the OV–10 through Congress.
                            In those circumstances he recommended seeing if we can put together a
                            decent package with items that would not be as Congressionally sensitive
                            as the OV–10. (C)</p>

                            national interest which is worth the effort of arguing. The problem with
                            the option favored by State is that it is a typical halfway measure
                            which gets everybody mad. When the stakes are high, as they are in North
                            Africa, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has an obligation to

                            the President, but in response to Assistant Secretary <persName

                            expressed concern that such consultations could become abdication.

                        </list>
                        <p>The issue we face is whether and to what extent our present arms supply
                            relationship with Morocco should be changed, as a means both 1) of
                            helping King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> cope with an
                            increasingly difficult military and political situation deriving from
                            the Western Sahara conflict; and 2) of encouraging him (and other
                            parties directly concerned) to seek a negotiated settlement. (C)</p>
                        <p>Our policy has been under review since the summer, a move precipitated by
                            Polisario strikes within the internationally recognized frontiers of
                            Morocco proper. Since then other key developments have occurred,
                            including:</p>
                        <p>—Moroccan annexation of the portion of the Western Sahara relinquished by
                            Mauritania; (U)</p>
                        <p>—Detailed consultations between State and relevant subcommittees of
                            Congress on the direction our North Africa policy should take; (U)</p>
                        <p>—Growing evidence that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> may
                            not be survivable in the absence of some military or political success
                            within the near future; (C)</p>
                        <p>—Cy’s consultations with concerned parties at the UNGA, including the
                            French, Saudis, and Egyptians (who forcefully reaffirmed the view that
                            we urgently need to do more to help Morocco); (C)</p>
                        <p>—An explicit Saudi appeal for bilateral cooperation to assist Morocco
                            militarily (they would finance Moroccan arms purchases from us). (C)</p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="0153" xml:id="pg_132"/>
                        <p>Against this background Cy chaired yesterday’s PRC, which developed three
                            sharply differentiated policy options. To ensure the fairest and most
                            accurate presentation of these options, I asked each “sponsoring” agency
                                <hi rend="italic">to provide its own language, included at Tabs 1,
                                2, and 3 respectively</hi>.<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Tabs 1, 2,
                                and 3 are not attached, but the policy options are printed in the
                                attachment to <ref target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note> (C)</p>
                        <p>Despite differing viewpoints, there is general agreement on four major
                            concerns: 1) we want to help <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>; 2) we see no prospect of a military solution by
                            either of the contending parties; 3) we wish to promote a negotiated
                            settlement; and 4) whatever policy we formulate should be accompanied by
                            word to <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> that we expect
                            him to move actively toward negotiations. (C)</p>
                        <p>The question thus becomes one of which <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            policy option stands the best chance of contributing to a negotiating
                            process. In that connection, I am impressed by French, Saudi, and
                            Egyptian assertions that unless <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> receives help which he himself, as well as his
                            adversaries, considers significant, there will be little incentive for
                            Algeria and the Polisario to negotiate (our experience with the
                            Egyptians and Israelis suggests that both sides feel confident and
                            stable—which is not Morocco’s case at present). I also believe that
                            continued deterioration of Morocco’s politico-military position will
                            merely promote conditions of increasing instability in a strategic
                            corner of Africa which will be inimical to our interests. (C)</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I believe that option 1 is totally inadequate, and option 2
                            is a typical slicing of the pie in the middle, which satisfies no one
                            and is not effective. We simply have to choose whether we are prepared
                            to support Morocco and with it Saudi Arabia and Egypt, or whether we are
                            prepared to watch the situation deteriorate further and perhaps even see
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> fall from power. If
                            we help <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, we are in a
                            better position to create a stalemate, and on that basis to press him to
                            negotiate with the Polisario and the Algerians. If <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> does not obtain help, neither
                            the Polisario nor the Algerians have much incentive to compromise. If
                            the argument is that <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1">Steve
                                Solarz</persName> won’t like it, we should be prepared to take him
                            on, and not have our foreign policy made for us by individual
                            congressmen. You have done him a lot of favors, but if he doesn’t help
                            us then we can stop doing him favors. The Senate is likely to support
                            us—for example, Birch Bayh would be prepared to go to the mat for us.
                            Frankly, I think State is using congressional opposition to justify a
                            recommendation that is timid and unresponsive. In brief, I think the
                            time has come for us to fish or cut bait insofar as <pb n="133"

                            firmness in supporting its friends; it is also meant, however, to
                            stabilize the situation and to encourage both sides to come to the
                            negotiating table. We thus expect the King to exploit the additional
                            support this decision conveys to express a willingness to negotiate with
                            the Algerians and the Polisario.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">See <ref

                            solution either by Morocco or by its opponents. The U.S. accordingly is

                                Morocco whatever arms are necessary for the defense of its own
                                territory, but not transferring weapons that clearly would be used
                                in the Western Sahara.</p>
                            <p><gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> believes the present policy is
                                the best way to bring about a negotiated settlement in the Western
                                Sahara and thus to ensure that King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                    >Hassan</persName> remains in power. Intelligence assessments
                                make clear that the course of the war will not be altered by the
                                availability of new types of weapons. In March 1979, we liberalized
                                our policy by supplying Morocco with F–5 spare parts and other
                                equipment, but this has provided no leverage in our efforts to
                                persuade <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> to negotiate
                                and he has prosecuted the war with greater vigor, but less success.
                                Regardless of what we tell <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                    >Hassan</persName>, further liberalization would probably
                                encourage him to believe that if he continues to pursue a military
                                solution, the United States ultimately will directly support him in
                                the Western Sahara. Thus, a change in policy would probably prolong
                                the conflict and risk escalation to direct Algerian-Moroccan
                                clashes. <pb n="135" facs="0156" xml:id="pg_135"/>Sending new types
                                of arms to Morocco would move us closer to direct involvement in a
                                no-win situation. Additionally, deeper U.S. involvement in the
                                Western Sahara conflict would jeopardize now-improving relations
                                with Algeria, and antagonize most <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                    >OAU</gloss> nations. Finally, liberalizing our policy would
                                provoke a bruising battle in the Congress where the responsible
                                committees in both Houses can be expected to hold public hearings on
                                resolutions of disapproval, raising questions about the
                                Administration’s commitment to arms transfer restraint.<note n="6"

                            <p>This option would backstop an active diplomacy with all concerned
                                parties to achieve a negotiated settlement by a partial relaxation
                                of our arms transfer policy to Morocco. We would still not supply
                                sensitive new weapons systems that would be particularly suited to
                                the Sahara war, such as the OV–10 or the Cobra attack helicopter. We
                                might sell the Hughes 500 MD anti-tank helicopter and non-lethal
                                items such as aerial surveillance equipment and night vision
                                devices. We would continue to support previously supplied equipment
                                and replace end items, including F–5 aircraft, <gloss

                            <p>With careful managing we think this policy will enable us to:</p>
                            <p>—Help <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> enough,
                                politically as well as militarily, to establish conditions making it
                                possible for him ultimately to negotiate peace terms that he and
                                Morocco can live with, while giving us the influence we need to move
                                him in this direction. At the same time our help would not be such
                                as to encourage him to believe he could win a military victory.</p>
                            <p>—Show concerned countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Tunisia that
                                we are willing to help our friends, but without going so far as to
                                alienate Algeria, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, and
                                third parties who are convinced Morocco should give up its claim to
                                the western Sahara.</p>
                            <p>—Avoid the bruising battle we would face in Congress under Option 3.
                                Systematic and detailed consultations with the committees of both
                                Houses since July indicate that both would oppose Option 3. The
                                Senate would support Option 2 while House opposition to Option 2
                                would be markedly less than for Option 3. Congressmen <persName

                                Senators Church and Javits have stated in a joint letter that “. . .
                                the United States should not provide weapons that would be suitable
                                only for counterinsurgency operations in the western Sahara.” Any

                            <p>All agencies agree that a diplomatic rather than a military solution
                                to the Western Sahara conflict is required. However, before
                                negotiations are possible, the military situation must stabilize.
                                The King must feel confident enough to negotiate, and the POLISARIO
                                and their supporters must realize that they cannot win a military
                                victory. Given the POLISARIO’s recent escalation, including
                                increasingly frequent attacks into Morocco proper, the <gloss

                                We favor a commitment to provide Morocco at least 6 OV–10 aircraft,
                                Cobra-TOW helicopters, and other material useful to his defense in
                                the Sahara, but the OV–10’s will not in fact be delivered until an

                                technical assistance will not win the war for Rabat. But it will

                                    Morocco. The Department was instructed to prepared a detailed
                                    status report that addressed formal congressional notification,
                                    the composition of an arms package, and Saudi financing. (Carter

                        <p>The President’s October 19 decision contained two conditions: first that
                            the whole arms package is contingent on King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s agreement to negotiate, and
                            second that OV–10 deliveries should not occur until negotiations have
                            actually begun.</p>
                        <p>We believe that, while we must continue to press hard for a firmer, and
                            more explicit commitment than we have received so far from <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, it will not be practical to
                            withhold action on this initial package pending such a commitment.<note

                            intent of the Presidential decision would be preserved by constant

                            progress by Morocco on the negotiating front. The initial package will
                            be of limited military value, and we should consider future sales in
                            light of progress toward a negotiated solution. Furthermore, we will
                            still retain the option of holding up deliveries of items in the initial
                                package.<note n="4" xml:id="d50fn4"><persName corresp="#p_RJ_1"

                            to Congress this month. His abrupt decision not to attend, however,
                            removed the excuse we would have used with Congress to justify pushing a

                        <p>We explained the situation to Senator Stone. Stone reportedly told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAB_1">Duke</persName> in a meeting on
                            December 3 that the Moroccan failure to go to Monrovia made it seem
                            unwise to expedite the procedure. Stone was apparently embarrassed,
                            however, when this judgment was reported back to the Moroccan
                                Ambassador.<note n="8" xml:id="d50fn8"><persName corresp="#p_RJ_1"
                                    >Rentschler</persName> underlined this and the previous
                                sentence.</note> Senator Stone subsequently repeated his concern for
                            prompt movement, both orally to the Moroccan Ambassador and in writing
                            to the Secretary on December 11.<note n="9" xml:id="d50fn9">Not
                                found.</note> Stone was aware of the technical and funding questions
                            and told the Saudi Ambassador that it was partly the Saudis’ fault that
                            the case had not been moved in December. In his latest conversation with
                            us, Senator Stone said that he hoped the case would move as soon as
                            possible, January if necessary, and that his letter of December 11 was
                            not meant to force our hand beyond that. This seems to conflict with
                            conversations he and his staff have had with others in the
                            Administration, and we are unable to explain the apparent
                                difference.<note n="10" xml:id="d50fn10"><persName corresp="#p_RJ_1"

                        <p>In its letter of September 21 the SFRC indicated support for military

                        <p>In the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the equation is different. At the

                            probably has the support of <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">Lee

                            sales. Another nod toward peace by the Moroccans will change that
                            equation, and <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1">Solarz</persName> is
                            beginning to waver because of some constituent concern that he is being
                            overly hard on Morocco. In the final analysis, even if the House Foreign
                            Affairs Committee should pass a resolution of disapproval, a defeat of a
                            resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would permit us to

                            <p>October 30—Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"

                                OV–10s, 24 Hughes 500 MD helicopters, and 20 F–5E/F aircraft.</p>
                            <p>November 10—State 294014 instructs Jidda to discuss with Saudis a
                                package of six OV–10s, 20 F–5E/F aircraft and either 24 Hughes 500
                                MD helicopters or 6–12 Cobras. Because of earlier Saudi interest in
                                only items which are available immediately, emphasis is put on
                                delivery times, which appeared long for both F–5E/F aircraft and
                                Hughes 500 MD helicopters.</p>
                            <p>November 15—Saudis agree in principle to package as described. They
                                do not react against the aggregate cost but do ask questions showing
                                a concern that the package provide an appreciable and early military

                                F–5E/F aircraft (replacements for F–5A/B aircraft Morocco has lost),
                                and either 24 Hughes 500 MD helicopters or 12 Cobras.</p>
                            <p>November 16 to Present—While contingency instructions have been
                                prepared to pin down composition of package with Rabat and Jidda,
                                the complicated process of determining whether Cobras can be
                                released from active U.S. inventories and whether delivery times for
                                Hughes 500’s could be accelerated had to run its course.</p>

                            <p>December 7—MUSLO (MAAG) Chief Rabat reports that Moroccan Air Force
                                Chief says he is not clear on helicopter choices available to him
                                and requests dispatch of a U.S. Army team to assist him in making a
                                decision. Moroccan Air Force Chief also reiterates desire for 20
                                instead of only eight F–5E/F aircraft. (U.S. agrees in principle
                                that a team could be sent.)</p>

                                and Rabat and would include readiness to send a U.S. team to

                                target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>—State declined) to review the
                            situation on the border and to get a better feel for the kind of
                            contingencies we might face. The session was informative. The following
                            are the major points of interest:</p>
                        <p>—There has been no major buildup by either Egypt or Libya over the past
                            year. Egypt has a two division equivalent force in place in the Western
                            Military District which could move on very little notice. The Egyptians
                            outnumber the Libyans by three to one.</p>
                        <p>—Both sides have concentrated on improving their defenses over the past
                            year, with Egypt putting much more money and attention into manning and
                            maintaining a credible force than the Libyans.</p>
                        <p>—Egypt has forces in place which could take eastern Libya within a week.
                            The major impediments to an Egyptian attack are: (1) the <pb n="142"
                                facs="0163" xml:id="pg_142"/>difficulties of sustaining a military
                            operation over very long lines of communication and supply; and (2)
                            concern that Libya will be able to find expatriate pilots to man their
                            sophisticated aircraft and air defenses.</p>
                        <p>—The Egyptians took advantage of the <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> speech to rectify an oversight.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d51fn3">In telegram 13419 from Cairo, June 16, the Embassy
                                reported on <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s speech
                                marking the tenth anniversary of the evacuation of U.S. bases in
                                Libya: “While focus of address is on <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                                establishment of U.S. bases on Egyptian-Libyan border, there is
                                significant escalation of Libyan rhetoric in Qaddafi’s call for
                                Egyptian Army to mutiny and overthrow <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                    >Sadat</persName> government.” (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D800294–0091)</note> When <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> lifted martial law, he should
                            have left the military in charge of the border region since civil
                            authority is not up to the massive job of patrolling. In fact, the
                            military had probably continued to perform this task in the interim
                            since May, and the <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> speech
                            provided the excuse to formalize the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>—There is no eagerness on the part of the Egyptian military to clash with
                            a neighboring Arab state unless there is a clear and persuasive case of
                            provocation, where Egypt is seen as the aggrieved party and where an
                            operation is seen as defending Egyptian honor and security.</p>
                        <p>—There have been no tangible acts by either side to date which would put
                            substance behind the heated exchange of words.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">General Conclusion</hi>. Although Egypt is technically
                            capable of launching an attack on Libya with virtually no warning, such
                            an attack will almost certainly not be launched without a prior
                            escalation of provocations considerably beyond the present rhetorical
                            posturing. The movement of ground attack aircraft (Mirages/F–4s) to the
                            Egyptian border would be an indication that they were preparing to act,
                            but that is not strictly essential. The intelligence community is aware
                            of our interest and will be watching closely for any signs of hostile
                            intentions.</p>

                            The best guess is that he was wounded in the arm. The attempt on his

                            overseas began in March with a murder in Rome, and it may have been this
                            policy which led someone to make the attempt on <persName

                            treatment—perhaps for a wound that was not healing properly—is entirely

                            mismanagement of the economy, the devastation of morale and organization
                            in the military, and such minor items as increasingly routine torture in
                            Libyan prisons have given an increasing number of people grievances

                        <p>I am struck by the recent report out of Cairo that the level of new
                            troops going into the Western Desert is far greater than <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and his military aides are
                            leading us to believe. Maybe this is just a “driver training exercise”
                            as someone suggested, but it may also be that we are being carefully
                            soothed in advance of a new <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            “surprise.” You will recall that our advance warning time of the 1973
                            war and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s visit to
                            Jerusalem were brief to non-existent. My guess is that something of the
                            magnitude of an attack on Libya would not be shared with us—for reasons
                            of security if nothing else—until just before he struck. He has promised
                            us advance notice—but he did not say how much!!!</p>
                        <p>I can’t prove this, but I have a nagging feeling that something is going
                            on.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>During the past six weeks there has been a sharp escalation of Libyan
                            military intervention in Chad, reportedly in response to requests for
                            assistance from Chad’s Transitional Government of National Union (GUNT).
                            The build-up includes the introduction of Soviet-built <pb n="145"
                                facs="0166" xml:id="pg_145"/>medium bombers, helicopter gunships and
                            light strike aircraft as well as Soviet tanks, howitzers and armored
                            personnel carriers. An estimated 3,000 Libyan combat and technical
                            personnel have arrived in Chad with this equipment.</p>
                        <p>Concern grows that Libya’s intervention goes beyond aiding the GUNT
                            against the forces of ex-Defense Minister Hissein Habre and is aimed at
                            a permanent presence in northern Chad in keeping with Libyan
                            expansionist policies.</p>
                        <p>While our interests in Chad are extremely limited, this increased Libyan
                            intervention is cause for concern. Our immediate goal in Chad is to gain
                            access to our Chancery to complete destruction of classified material.
                            If Goukouni forces occupy all of N’Djamena, and if Libya does not play a
                            spoiling role, the U.S. re-entry team standing by in Kousseri (Cameroon)
                            should be able to complete its task within three hours.</p>
                        <p>Of longer term interest is prevention of Libyan domination of its
                            southern neighbor. To pursue this goal we have concentrated efforts on
                            an information campaign, including the sharing of satellite imagery
                            showing Libyan equipment, that seeks to (a) increase awareness among
                            Chad’s neighbors of the Libyan threat; (b) encourage Chad’s neighbors to
                            condemn Libya’s actions and (c) strengthen the will of Chadian
                            nationalists to resist any effort by Libya to occupy or dominate Chad.
                            Meanwhile, we will continue our dialogue with the GUNT concentrating our
                            focus on humanitarian assistance which was the topic of a recent
                            exchange of letters between Presidents Goukouni and <persName

                        <p>1. Summary. There has been significant improvement in our relations with
                            Algeria over past two years, due largely to Algerian interest in our
                            technology and market. Algeria will continue to be a force in
                            international politics and to cause trouble, but it has dropped back to
                            the second rank and as its economy grows may become more responsible.
                            The country looks stable under the direction of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, and the regime seems
                            remarkably relaxed about opposition. For better or worse, Algeria will
                            be dominant power in North Africa. Our posture towards it should take
                            into account our need for its energy resources. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. This is a retrospective and impressionistic look at the development of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Algerian relations over past two

                            period under consideration there has been a significant improvement in
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Algerian relations, in spite of
                            Algerian unhappiness with our position on the Sahara. This change has
                            reflected the growing interdependence between <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> (discussed in my economic valedictory)<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d55fn2">Telegram 373 from Algiers, February 12. (National
                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, D770051–0395)</note>
                            and the limited choices open to Algerians. While there are other sources
                            of technology and other markets, and while our companies are not as
                            efficient as Germans or Italians when it comes to construction in
                            Algeria, our positive approach and the size of our market make us their
                            most interesting available partner.</p>
                        <p>4. Nature and extent of improvement should not be exaggerated. We do,
                            however, have improved access to senior Algerian officials and are now
                            able to carry on something of a dialogue with them on subjects <pb
                                n="148" facs="0169" xml:id="pg_148"/>of mutual interest. There has
                            furthermore been a quantum jump in expressions of official interest in
                            technical and education cooperation with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>. A quick count, for instance, shows that the Ministries
                            of Higher Education, Agriculture, National Defense, Health, and the
                            Gendarmerie have all shown interest in the past two years in opening up
                            one or more avenues of cooperation. While Industry and Energy and
                            Finance have had close relations with us for some time, the other
                            Ministries mentioned above have not. As I have said before, we have
                            become respectable and a latent interest in things American is now being
                            allowed to surface. Thus, President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> told me during my farewell call that he hoped
                            the teaching of English would be emphasized and expanded in the local
                            education system in order to give the Algerians an alternative to
                            reliance on French culture.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">Telegram 366 from
                                Algiers, February 12, summarized the meeting. (National Archives, RG
                                59, Central Foreign Policy File, D770051–0315)</note> He noted that
                            the 1600 Algerian students now in the United States are a manifestation
                            of increased Algerian interest in our technology and said that interest
                            would increase as their economy developed.</p>
                        <p>5. The United States will nevertheless continue to be fair game in local
                            media. We are unlikely ever to qualify as a brotherly socialist state
                            and we can expect that our positions on most Third World issues will be
                            criticized locally, unless we undergo a substantial change in our own
                            outlook. The press does not reflect the attitudes of the average
                            Algerian, or necessarily always those of the government, but it is an
                            expression of the image we have for many Algerians. We are going to find
                            this irritating, but should not rise to the bait. It is well to protest
                            the more egregious offenses, but we should ignore the daily pinpricks,
                            and hope that eventually, as their economy expands and they become more
                            interested in stability and less in revolution, the Algerians will
                            become more responsible.</p>
                        <p>6. In the multilateral area the Algerians have pulled in their horns
                            somewhat over the past 18 months, apparently because they were tired of
                            getting all the opprobrium for their forward position on Third World
                            issues. They are still a force to be reckoned with, however, and we will
                            continue to find them a thorn in our side on many issues. We should not
                            be afraid to make our position known to them clearly and forcefully, and
                            we may hope that one day our representations will have some effect.</p>
                        <p>7. Malcolm Kerr in an article some ten years ago said that doing business
                            with Nasser was like trying to change a tire on a moving automobile.
                            Doing business with Algeria is not like that. The car is not <pb n="149"
                                facs="0170" xml:id="pg_149"/>moving. It is just that the lug nuts
                            won’t screw on properly, but with enough care and attention the tire
                            will eventually get mounted.</p>
                        <p>8. B. Building institutions—One reason our relations have improved has
                            been the Algerian concentration on institution-building over the past
                            year. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, who has been
                            fond of saying that Algeria was “solid” because if he went the people
                            would remain and would know what to do, has nevertheless been well aware
                            of the lack of institutions to take over should he disappear. He has no
                            apparent intention to share any real power with them, but he is
                            nevertheless going through a carefully worked-out process of setting up
                            institutions, a constitution, a Parliament, and a reorganized
                            government—to give the regime legitimacy and to make a power transition
                            possible at some point. Energies which might otherwise have been
                            expended on causing trouble internationally have been dedicated to this
                            task, and the points of irritation between us have diminished
                            accordingly. In particular, the Sahara has been put on the back
                                burner—<persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> did not
                            even mention the word (although he referred to it indirectly) in our
                            last conversation.<note n="4" xml:id="d55fn4">An unknown hand
                                highlighted the last sentence of this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <p>9. The building of these institutions has not been greeted with a great
                            deal of enthusiasm locally and there is a vocal, if modest, opposition
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> and all his
                            policies. The significance of this opposition is hard to gauge, and its
                            future role will be determined to a large extent by the role the
                            institutions are allowed to play. If the Parliament in fact is allowed
                            to express the opinions of its members and enjoys some authority, the
                            positions of regime opponents may be pre-empted.</p>
                        <p>10. Two questions:</p>
                        <p>A. Will the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> get it all together?:
                            The Algerians are embarked not only on building institutions but on a
                            forced draft industrialization program which has occasioned much waste
                            and a good deal of inefficient use of resources. The biggest single
                            problem is that of the lack of competent people to run things. Middle
                            management is a waste land, and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
                            delays have been caused by governmental inefficiency. Given the
                            population growth rate (3.2 percent) and the massive unemployment
                            (upwards of 25 percent) it is hard to be optimistic. Yet there are
                            positive factors. For one thing, there seems to be general agreement on
                            goals and there is a very competent elite which makes decisions on the
                            basis of logical (if flawed) reasoning rather than family interest. For
                            another, Algeria’s resources are impressive, and a certain amount of
                            waste can be absorbed without fatal consequences.</p>
                        <p>11. It seems to me necessary to strike a balance somewhere between
                            Pangloss and Cassandra. The Algerians are going to fall short of their
                                <pb n="150" facs="0171" xml:id="pg_150"/>goals. How short is the
                            question. My own guess is that they will get about 80 per cent of what
                            they are trying to do done.<note n="5" xml:id="d55fn5">An unknown hand
                                placed a checkmark in the right-hand margin next to this
                                sentence.</note> That is a passing grade, but whether they will be
                            left with an unmanageable industrial establishment which is producing
                            all the wrong things at the wrong time, and doing so poorly, as many of
                            my colleagues argue, or whether they will eventually arrive at a
                            second-rate but nevertheless functional equilibrium is the question. It
                            is easy to make comparisons with Mohamed Ali’s experiment in 19th
                            century Egypt, but the Algerians are considerably more sophisticated,
                            and have much more to work with, than the Egyptians were and did then.
                            As a perennial optimist, I will bet the Algerians reach a satisfactory
                            equilibrium some time within the next twenty years, but I won’t bet
                                much.<note n="6" xml:id="d55fn6">An unknown hand highlighted the
                                last two sentences of this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <p>12. B. How stable is Algeria? This is a question very much on the minds
                            of American businessmen contemplating this place. It is of course
                            impossible to predict what will happen here. Change is inevitable sooner
                            or later. I am impressed, however, by the relatively relaxed attitude of
                            the regime.<note n="7" xml:id="d55fn7">An unknown hand underlined the
                                phrase “relatively relaxed attitude of the regime.”</note> Although
                            there is opposition to it, as far as we can tell there are no political
                            prisoners except some five people, including Ben Bella, who are under
                            house arrest. The Army is as far as we know loyal to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> and it holds the keys to
                            power. There is always the risk that he will be assassinated. It would
                            be easy to do. He often rides unescorted in the front seat of a BMW and
                            follows an itinerary that frequently takes him through heavy traffic. I
                            suspect, however, that, barring accidents, he will be with us for some
                            time and that he will continue to rule Algeria with a firm hand. As long
                            as he is in power there will be stability. When he passes, someone else
                            will fill his shoes peacefully.<note n="8" xml:id="d55fn8">An unknown

                        <p>13. Conclusion: I close with the observation that, for better or worse,
                            Algeria is going to be the dominant power in North Africa. We may feel
                            warm about Tunisia and Morocco, but our economic interests are here.
                            This is one of the four or five most important states on the African
                            continent and in deciding what our posture towards it should be, we
                            should keep in mind the need to heat our homes in a winter like that we
                            are now passing through.<note n="9" xml:id="d55fn9">An unknown hand

                            Africa have remained in a relatively fixed pattern since the mid-1960’s.
                            Ties with Morocco and Tunisia are close, but ideological hostility and

                            financing. As a result, while Algerian positions on specific issues
                            involving concrete interests remain unchanged, the confrontational
                            tactics of past years seem to be waning.</p>

                            through a long, cumbersome process of institution-building that has
                            included four major elections. In addition, the country’s ambitious
                            development programs have slowed. Inflation, sluggish performance,
                            bureaucratic inefficiency, shortages of consumer items, and other
                            problems have resulted in growing popular disillusionment.</p>

                            many world issues and the development of a close relationship between
                            Algeria and the United States is a matter of great interest to me.</p>
                        <p>3. Since coming to office in January, I have been extremely pleased to
                            see the growing cooperation between our two countries in a variety of
                            fields. I am most appreciative for the opportunity which you accorded
                            Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>
                            to meet with you for such a thorough exchange of views when he visited
                            Algiers in April.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">See <ref target="#d57fn4"

                            the arrival of Ambassador Maoui, whose presence in Washington will

                            discussed the Middle East situation with you in detail when he was in
                            Algiers. I wish to underscore the commitment of the United States to the
                            search for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. We will continue
                            to work toward a reconvening of the Geneva Conference this year. As I
                            have stated publicly, our policy will not be affected by changes in
                            leadership in any of the countries in the Middle East. We expect Israel
                            and her neighbors to continue to be bound by <gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                            relations, a subject of great importance to us both. I feel that it is
                            especially important that the Conference on International Economic
                            Cooperation show constructive results during the Ministerial meeting in
                            Paris at the end of this month.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">The final

                            meeting presents an opportunity to make progress on a number of
                            important economic issues and also to establish a framework within which
                            to continue our discussions on questions of mutual concern. Several
                            questions require special attention. These include the transfer of
                            resources, where it will hopefully be possible to reach agreement on the
                            need for increased and more effective flows of foreign assistance,
                            particularly to the low income countries; commodities, where we will be
                            prepared to give new political momentum to the work in Geneva on

                            have been instructed to maintain close contact with their Algerian
                            counterparts as the Ministerial meeting unfolds. I hope to hear from you

                            with you personally at an early date. I hope that you will be able to
                            visit the United States at a mutually convenient time in the future so

                            is considered as a real friend by us. Bilaterally our relations have
                            reached such a degree that it would be a pity to leave aside political
                            contacts. Our economic and cultural relations have advanced very
                            well.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I share that view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>: We should have a

                            We already have 2,000 students in your country and a number of Americans
                            are teaching in Algeria. The cultural agreement <pb n="161" facs="0182"
                                xml:id="pg_161"/>would act as a framework and would complement what
                            we have in the commercial and economic area. Our relations are all the
                            more important in that they touch upon sensitive areas such as energy
                            and the petrochemical industry. We are sending as our new Ambassador to
                            Washington Ambassador Maoui who has 12 years of experience in our
                            government, is well aware of our problems, and as a former Secretary
                            General of the Foreign Ministry is very interested in having his mission
                            be successful. Let me tell you something which I have not mentioned
                            before and which I am saying here for the first time. We have a number
                            of American citizens in jail in Algeria for drug related offenses. We
                            had already reduced some of their sentences but on the occasion of
                            Ambassador Maoui’s assignment to Washington we are releasing five of
                            these individuals.<note n="4" xml:id="d60fn4">An unknown hand placed a

                            There are actually six, although the sixth one is in jail for sabotage.
                            He had been sentenced to death but then the sentence had been commuted
                            to imprisonment. I appreciate very much your letter concerning the Paris

                        <p>The Secretary: Let me state that there is a very genuine will and desire
                            on our part to have an open and forthcoming dialogue with Algeria. This
                            is important for our country and I look forward to opening and pursuing
                            that dialogue.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>: There is no
                            outstanding issue between our two countries.<note n="8" xml:id="d60fn8"

                            policy and have now been settled. I refer to Southeast Asia and to

                            topicality. We follow closely your efforts to find a solution in
                            Southern Africa. We are interested in the modest approach you follow
                            towards Africa. We sense a new American approach vis-a-vis the third
                            world and it is extremely important for us to have the feeling that you
                            are now prepared to listen to new viewpoints before formulating a
                            position. In the past, we had the feeling that your position was
                            pre-determined and, therefore, there was no sense in having a dialogue.
                            But now we feel that you are prepared to listen to other voices.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We do wish to listen and learn from those who are involved
                            in Africa before determining what our attitude can be in dealing with
                            the problem. Concerning African problems, we feel that the solution
                            should be found by the Africans themselves but we are willing to play
                            our part in assisting to find a solution in conjunction with the people
                            of the area, not imposing views from outside.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>: This approach is fair
                            and attractive, and I ask as an interested party because there is a huge
                            ambiguity in my part of the world concerning the Western Sahara.<note

                            Nevertheless, I had the feeling that a bad solution was favored in the
                            Western Sahara, as if in weighing the problem more weight was placed on
                            one part of the scale to the detriment of the other. Decolonialization
                            of that area is a time bomb for the entire region. We have no problem
                            with Morocco or Mauritania. We have treaties of cooperation with them.
                            The people of these countries share the same interests and aspirations.
                            Their leaders were together in the fight against French colonialism.
                            Nothing separates us. We see a small people, very few in numbers, being
                            deprived of the right to speak, of the right of self-expression. Our
                            position is very flexible. If the people are consulted and say they want
                            to be Moroccans or Mauritanians or both, we shall give our support and
                            our blessing to that decision.<note n="11" xml:id="d60fn11">An unknown

                            not want to belong to either of them, then a solution must be found. The
                            international community has not abandoned self-determination and Spain
                            as the sponsoring nation cannot dispose of the sovereignty of the
                            people. We all remember the circumstances. <persName corresp="#p_FF_1"
                                >Franco</persName> was dying. Spain does not know how to
                            decolonialize. It has left problems before departing from Equatorial
                            Guinea and it is now leaving problems in the Western Sahara. Let me add
                            that we follow with sympathy the democratization process now going on in
                            Spain. We have a situation here where Morocco, Mauritania, <pb n="163"
                                facs="0184" xml:id="pg_163"/>Algeria and Spain are all involved. The
                            real problem is very much like the problem of the Middle East where
                            there is no solution without the Palestinians. Here there can be no
                            solution without the Sahraouis.</p>
                        <p>Algeria does not seek a corridor to the Atlantic or a port on the
                            Atlantic. We do not seek a share in the Bu Craa phosphates.<note n="12"

                            for its own people and people of the region. We have arranged to

                            for us. It is only a matter of justice and principle.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Let me ask you a question. As you know we have stayed
                            apart from the controversy. I have talked to the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>

                            outlined the solution when I say that we have no territorial claim over

                            our situation to be misinterpreted. We are not like Morocco or
                            Mauritania with the additional justification that we would not have
                            succeeded. But yesterday’s remedy is not possible today and what is
                            possible today would not be possible tomorrow. Years ago, mock elections
                            could have taken place. This is not possible today because the Saharouis
                            have developed a genuine national awareness.<note n="15"

                            could have been held in the past because Algeria did not particularly
                            seek a role. I believe that Ambassador Young recently met with Saharan
                            delegates in Maputo. I think you should delegate someone to meet with
                            them and get an idea of the total situation. Public opinion in Algeria
                            is very sensitized to the problem.</p>
                        <p>Today you would find more Algerians to make sacrifices for the Saharouis

                            solution, and our feeling concerning Morocco and Mauritania is one of
                            sorrow because they were our friends. They were our companions in arms.

                            of cooperation with King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            and with President Ould Daddah. We have had a long honeymoon. In fact,
                            for a time it was almost Mauritania against Morocco, and Algeria against
                            Morocco and it was as a result of our efforts that Morocco recognized
                            Mauritania. Mauritania does not have a land problem. We would understand
                            this from the Chinese people, but Mauritania is underpopulated and does
                            not want to extend its territory. That would be my first reflection.</p>
                        <p>The second point would be a consultation with the people. They can become
                            Mauritanians or Moroccans and say so freely in a consultation.<note

                            these people be destroyed in a genocide? That is immoral. There are
                            quite a number of minor states with fewer people. Given the national
                            wealth of the region and how well organized the people are, it could
                            become a small Qatar or a new Emirate. It has lots of resources and a
                            very dynamic people.</p>
                        <p>Now people immediately begin to raise the speculation of the ideology of
                            being communist or becoming communist. Algeria fought for eight years
                            for its decolonialization and we are not communists. Surely you can say
                            that Algeria is very keen on its independence, very nationalistic, very
                            touchy on the subject but we are not communists.<note n="19"

                            in Algeria during the discussion on our new national charter and he
                            witnessed the whole procedure and knows this well. Islam is the
                            strongest obstacle to communism. I am not pronouncing any judgment
                            against communism. We have relations with all countries and ask only
                            that our sovereignty be respected. The third question is that since you
                            talk about a homeland for the Palestinians, why can you not find a
                            homeland for the Saharouis, who do not want to live in Mauritania and
                            cannot go on being refugees in Algeria. Algeria knows war. Algeria has
                            experienced war at firsthand, in World War II, in which our people were
                            involved, and in the war against French colonialization. Our people
                            yearn for peace, a peace which cannot be disturbed for a grain of sand.
                            We seek political justice in the region. I believe it would strengthen
                            the cause of peace and it is a noble and important objective for the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to undertake. Having first
                            avoided the confrontation, international legality would then come into
                            play. On the other side, there are some rigid precepts. “We have annexed
                            it and we shall keep it.” It should be an easy question to resolve what
                            the people want and for them to say so freely.</p>

                            there. There was a rather specific reversal. Why would the King of Spain
                            go to al Aioun and two weeks later announce partition, claiming that it
                            was part of the legacy of General <persName corresp="#p_FF_1"
                                >Franco</persName>. We all know that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_FF_1">Franco</persName> was intractable on the subject.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>’s position was then clearly in
                            support of self-determination, we wonder if there was at that time some
                            secret diplomacy on your part and that the arrangement was blessed by
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. I may be wrong but I want to say
                            what I think. So we must now make an effort to consolidate the effort
                            for peace, avoid a confrontation that would be costly for the whole
                            region. The region is ailing already. We have Libya versus Egypt,
                            problems in the Sudan, Chad and Tunisia. I am sure you can make a
                            contribution to having Morocco find a new solution for the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Your description of the problem as perceived by Algeria
                            has been very helpful. I want to reflect on what you have told me.<note

                        <p>1. Algeria’s philosophy of revolutionary socialism, its economic
                            self-interest, and its political commitments as Arab/African state bring
                            Algerians to oppose us on most multilateral issues.</p>
                        <p>2. Question becomes not how can we convert Algerians but how best we can
                            reduce their impact, either by stifling their activism or by
                            undercutting their influence.</p>
                        <p>3. Past year has seen decline in both Algerian activism and influence
                            because of <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> focus on Sahara and on
                            internal institution-building and economic development.</p>
                        <p>4. This focus provides opportunity we can attempt exploit to further the
                            decline. Algerians hope that new <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            administration will be more forthcoming on such Algerian concerns as
                            Sahara and New International Economic Order.<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3"
                                >The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International
                                Economic Order, adopted on May 1, 1974, at the Sixth Special Session
                                of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly, aimed to
                                redress the balance between developed and developing countries in
                                trade, commodities, and development.</note> In addition Algerians
                            have had to recognize increasing difficulty of obtaining financing for
                            their development projects. These factors have produced distinct
                            improvement in atmosphere of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Algerian
                            bilateral relations and have had spillover on Algerian behavior in
                            international fora, for example at CIEC meeting in Paris.</p>
                        <p>5. In this context, organizing for multilateral diplomacy vis-a-vis
                            Algeria involves:</p>
                        <p>A. Continued effort to maintain and expand cordial bilateral atmosphere
                            by such actions as:</p>
                        <p>I. Continued briefings on President’s, Vice President’s, and Secretary’s
                            meetings on Middle East and Southern African issues;</p>
                        <p>II. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> visit to <gloss

                        <p>III. Continued public neutrality on Sahara and show of flexibility in
                            North-South dialogue.</p>
                        <p>B. Continued effort to ensure Algerians aware of our views on key
                            multilateral issues and of importance we attach to them by such actions
                            as:</p>
                        <p>I. Use of Presidential and Secretarial messages on key issues;</p>
                        <p>II. Repeated mention of key issues not only by Embassy on specific
                            instructions but also by high-ranking visitors;</p>
                        <p>III. Provision of French translations to post.</p>
                        <p>6. We cannot expect to change many Algerian positions. We can expect to
                            contribute to muffling their influence. On many issues, such as Middle
                            East and Southern Africa, Algerians have abdicated responsibility for
                            articulating own positions and have indicated willingness to go along
                            with whatever parties directly concerned accept. On other issues, such
                            as illicit payments and <gloss target="#t_ILO_1">ILO</gloss>, Algerians
                            have been increasingly satisfied to remain “in the middle of the pack”,
                            as one Foreign Ministry official expressed it, rather than to lead pack
                            as they have in past.</p>
                        <p>7. For time being we should concentrate on encouraging these trends.
                            Further on down line, as our economic/commercial and cultural ties grow
                            and as past suspicions diminish, we may be able to do more. Algerians
                            have already demonstrated willingness to assist us on certain restricted
                            issues, for example diplomatic relations with Iraq. It will be a while
                            before we can expect such cooperation on broader multilateral issues. In
                            meantime, we should work to preserve and further their silence and
                            inactivity.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> elaborated on this
                            theme in discussion, criticizing the French also for their military role
                            in Zaire and Chad. When he sought assurance there had been no change in
                            administration’s African policy, Secretary reminded him that U.S. has
                            sought peaceful resolution of African disputes, while Soviets have
                            fueled the fires of conflict with massive arms shipments. <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> said he had told Castro,
                            Kosygin, and Mengistu the Eritrean conflict will have to be settled
                            politically, and that Castro had told him Cuban troops would not become
                            involved. On Namibia, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>
                            said Algeria will support a solution acceptable to the Front Line
                            states. <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> admitted there
                            have been secret peace talks between Rabat and Algiers on the Western
                            Sahara war. However, he indicated these have not been productive.</p>
                        <p>Secretary pledged continuing U.S. neutrality. <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> outlined terms of a possible settlement. On
                            the Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> was
                            highly critical of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and
                            argued that the Soviets be given a larger role in the peace process.
                            Secretary took the occasion to give him a briefing on our current Middle
                            East policy. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> called on Secretary
                            June 10 following request for appointment from Algerian Embassy, which
                            said <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> had been
                            instructed to seek meeting by Algerian President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>. Talks which lasted two and
                            half hours covered following topics:</p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="0191" xml:id="pg_170"/>
                        <p>3. U.S. African policy and the French: As discussion began, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> handed Secretary letter from
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> (text, which being
                            cabled <gloss target="#t_septel_1">septel</gloss>, protests French
                            military intervention in Africa). <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> quickly took up same theme, claiming African
                            Anglophones and those other African nations maintaining “policy of
                            national independence” join Algeria in opposition to French action.
                            Commenting that French appear to be acting on behalf of the West,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> asked rhetorically
                            why the West intervened to support defective, incompetent and corrupt
                            leaders against their own peoples. Accusing French of engaging in
                            colonial conquest, he said Paris is seeking encircle Algeria by
                            extending its influence in surrounding states. He suggested that if
                            Algeria forced to choose between suffering French attacks and permitting
                            Soviets to establish bases, Algeria would do latter. Noting that U.S. is
                            associated with France and Morocco in Shaba operation, <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> asked if this represented a long
                            term change in U.S. policy. He called on U.S. to urge France to act with
                            greater restraint in Africa. He then attacked African intervention force
                            proposed by France.</p>
                        <p>4. Replying, Secretary assured <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> there has been no change in African policies
                            of <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration,
                            reminding him that new administration had substantially increased
                            economic assistance to Africa, had given clear support for African
                            majority rule in Southern Africa and had sought peaceful resolution of
                            problems, while Soviets and Cubans poured in arms which escalated
                            conflict. With regard to Zaire, U.S. respected <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> principle of territorial integrity. Danger to civilians
                            arose from violation of international frontier. U.S. response to
                            requests for assistance from Zaire, France and Belgium was motivated by
                            humanitarian factors. He added parenthetically that U.S. action was a
                            specific response to situation in Shaba and not within the context of
                            proposals for an African peacekeeping force. U.S. realizes fundamental
                            reforms are necessary in Zaire and will seek these for the benefit of
                            the country’s people. Secretary again invited <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> to look at record of U.S.
                            African policy over previous 18 months and assured <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> that U.S. wants Algeria to
                            continue to pursue its policy of national independence.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> said he was
                            reassured by Secretary’s reaffirmation of administration’s African
                            policy. He said Algeria also supported principle of territorial
                            integrity and had demonstrated it in Congo, Biafra and Ethiopian
                            contexts. Mobutu’s accusations of Algerian complicity in renewed Shaba
                            incursion were prompted by French and Moroccans, he claimed. He blamed
                            South Africans for Shaba problem, indicating he thought they brought it
                            on via their support for Savimbi in an effort to distract attention from
                            their designs in Namibia and Rhodesia.</p>
                        <p>6. Namibia and Rhodesia: As examples of U.S. efforts to promote peaceful
                            settlements, Secretary outlined for <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> current efforts <pb n="171" facs="0192"
                                xml:id="pg_171"/>to reach agreement on future of Zambia and
                            Rhodesia. He expressed hope Algerians would use their good offices to
                            get <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> to accept the principles
                            formulated by the Group of Five<note n="4" xml:id="d63fn4">The Group of
                                Five, comprised of France, the United States, the United Kingdom,
                                Canada, and the Federal Republic of Germany, worked to resolve the
                                conflict between the South-West Africa People’s Organization
                                (Namibia) and the South African Government.</note> which are
                            supported by the Front Line states. He said U.S. also would appreciate
                            any help Algerians could give to promote Rhodesian settlement.</p>
                        <p>7. Algeria fully supports Front Line states, <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> said. Discussing Walvis Bay, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> expressed belief this issue
                            is principal obstacle to <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss>’s
                            adhesion to Group of Five’s proposals. Secretary then outlined elements
                            of public statement Group of Five prepared to make concerning Walvis Bay
                            if <gloss target="#t_SWAPO_1">SWAPO</gloss> would agree to defer
                            resolution of its status until after elections. He also clarified other
                            aspects of Group of Five proposal and reactions of individual Front Line
                            Presidents. Responding, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> described himself as personally
                            reassured.</p>
                        <p>8. Western Sahara: Responding to the Secretary’s inquiry regarding press
                            reports of talks between Rabat and Algiers, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> admitted these have occurred, asking
                            Secretary to treat this information confidentially. He accused Moroccans
                            of press leaks designed to forestall efforts by third parties to mediate
                            dispute. If this behavior continued, he said, Algeria will reveal that
                            no progress has been made and that the two parties remain in total
                            disagreement. His personal belief, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> claimed, is that Moroccans think French
                            intervened in Mauritania partially to prevent Morocco from extending its
                            borders to Nouakchott or even St. Louis. In brief discussion of possible
                            solutions, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> said that
                            realizing <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> had put his
                            throne at risk Algeria appreciates some concession must be made to his
                            ambitions. He suggested Morocco might keep portion of Sahara including
                            phosphate mines and part of seacoast, while Saharans received remainder
                            of territory now occupied by Morocco and Mauritania. Although the
                            Moroccan political parties are very bellicose, there are factions in
                            Morocco which favor peace, even within the royal entourage. He suggested
                            that if U.S. helped Algeria by getting the French to pull back rather
                            than fueling fires, Algeria would work for a relaxation of tension in
                            the area. He cautioned that, as with Namibia, it would be difficult to
                            achieve progress. Without making any comment on this proposal, Secretary
                            said U.S. policy toward Sahara dispute would remain one of
                            neutrality.</p>
                        <p>9. During exchange on the Horn, Secretary said U.S. could see no possible
                            justification for Cuban military involvement in Eritrea, as the dispute
                            is purely internal. Such involvement moreover would be inconsistent with
                            Cuban pretensions of non-alignment. In fact, U.S. already has told
                            Cubans there is no justification for them to remain in Ethiopia. <pb

                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> said they already
                            had been ejected from two Nilotic countries and that no superpower
                            should want to see the other superpower feeling humiliated. Superpowers
                            should regard each other within the context of global issues, and the
                            U.S. should not force the Soviets’ backs to the wall if U.S. wants a
                            SALT agreement. Both U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                            should “close eyes to some things” in the search for equilibrium. He

                            Cuba would not become militarily engaged in Eritrea. The problem
                            demanded a political solution, and <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"

                            Mengistu, as well as on Castro. Asked by the Secretary why 17,000 Cuban
                            troops remain in Ethiopia, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> said the Ethiopians fear new trouble in the

                        </opener>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter of May 20.<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">See <ref

                            great importance to our relations with Algeria and am glad for this
                            opportunity to renew our dialogue. I was pleased too that Secretary

                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> were able to have
                            such a useful discussion, when the Minister delivered your letter.</p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_173"/>
                        <p>I completely understand your concern about events in the Sahara. The
                            United States is in the fortunate position of enjoying good relations
                            with all three governments involved in this question. While maintaining
                            a position of neutrality ourselves, we will continue to urge our friends
                            in each country to seek a peaceful settlement. I was encouraged to learn
                            that there have been some discussions, and I earnestly hope these
                            eventually will prove successful, for we would like to see peace
                            restored in North Africa.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the Western Sahara conflict, I am deeply concerned about other
                            areas of tension and conflict in Africa. Under my Administration, the
                            United States has followed an African policy which has emphasized
                            support for majority rule, substantially increased economic assistance,
                            and the active pursuit of peaceful solutions to African disputes. Recent
                            United States actions in Zaire were a specific and humanitarian response
                            to the danger to civilians in Shaba Province resulting from the
                            violation of Zaire’s border, and did not reflect any change in our
                            African policy.</p>
                        <p>During their discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> had an opportunity to clarify our two
                            Governments’ views on other African issues, as well as those problems
                            which impede the search for a durable peace in the Middle East. Such
                            exchanges are very helpful in our continuing efforts to expand
                            communications between Algeria and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The United States and Algeria have many interests and perspectives in
                            common. Foremost among these is the mutual recognition that conflict is
                            in the interests of no nation in the long term, that peace is the
                            foundation upon which the true prosperity and well-being of every nation
                            is based, and that respect for the sovereign independence and
                            territorial integrity of others is essential to preserve stability and
                            harmony in relations among nations. Those are the principles upon which
                            the United States has relied in dealing with you and your neighbors in
                            the Maghreb in the past, and they will form the basis of our policy in
                            the future. I hope to be in touch with you soon to propose specific
                            dates for your visit to Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">In a

                        </list>
                        <p>Our policy toward Algeria in recent years has consisted of building on
                            the strength of our mutual economic interests, which are quite
                            extensive, in order to engage in an increasingly serious political
                            dialogue on issues such as the Middle East, third-world economic <pb
                                n="176" facs="0197" xml:id="pg_176"/>demands, and the Sahara
                            conflict. We have tried to keep our political differences from affecting
                            our economic relations, and we have wanted <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> to feel that he has an alternative to
                            exclusive and heavy reliance on the Soviets. On the whole, this policy
                            has served us fairly well, although the political dialogue that we have
                            sought has never really gotten off the ground.</p>
                        <p>As you know, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> is now
                            gravely ill. A U.S. medical team arrived in Algiers on Sunday to offer
                            emergency assistance,<note n="2" xml:id="d66fn2">Sunday, November 19. In
                                telegram 3339 from Algiers, November 24, the Embassy reported on
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s status:
                                “Although <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> is still
                                in a coma, ‛his situation is better than ever’ and good enough that
                                the doctors have decided that the risks of surgery outweigh the
                                possible benefits at least for now.” (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D780485–0133)</note> but the prognosis
                            is not good. If <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> is
                            replaced, there is likely to be a period of confusion in Algeria since
                            there is no obvious successor. The Foreign Minister and the Interior
                            Minister are both possible candidates and we have established a
                            reasonably good working relationship with the former.</p>
                        <p>During any succession struggle, we will want to use our influence to
                            strengthen the hand of the moderates. This means sticking with our
                            policy of formal neutrality on the Sahara conflict for the moment,
                            cooperating normally in economic and technical spheres, and continuing
                            to express interest in an ongoing political dialogue. Until we see what
                            the new leadership looks like, it will be difficult to develop a more
                            finely-tuned policy. If <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> dies, a high-level U.S. representative might
                            head the delegation to the funeral and could carry a Presidential
                            message to the new leadership.</p>

                            an end an era in Algerian politics marked by surprising stability,
                            militancy on Third World and Palestinian issues, entanglement in an
                            unpopular war over the Sahara, and a heavily statist, but nonetheless
                            impressive, social and economic policy. Based on what I know of the
                            likely successors, <hi rend="italic">I would predict:</hi> (S)</p>
                        <p>—a period of preoccupation with internal problems. Great care will be
                            taken to maintain law and order. Vivid memories exist of the near-civil
                            war after independence. (U)</p>
                        <p>—some relaxation of the socialistic economic system, which has not been
                            popular or particularly effective. (U)</p>
                        <p>—continued commitment to rapid social-economic development and a hawkish
                            stand on oil prices. (C)</p>
                        <p>—a non-aligned foreign policy. I do not anticipate closer ties with the
                            Soviets. We may be able to develop fairly good relations with the new
                            leadership. (S)</p>
                        <p>—a gradual disengagement from the Sahara conflict through a negotiated
                            solution. (C)</p>
                        <p>The risks in the period ahead are that the hard-won stability and unity
                            of the country, which was <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s greatest achievement, may be lost. Weak
                            leadership or a crisis of authority could open the way for a more
                            pro-Soviet group, or for reliance on an aggressive foreign policy to
                            foster domestic unity. This is clearly not in our interest. (S)</p>
                        <p>Assuming that real power rests in the hands of Colonels Yahyaoui (head of
                            the Party), Ben Ahmed (Interior Minister), Ben Djedid (head of the
                            western military district), and to some extent <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> (Foreign Minister), we
                            should be able to develop relatively good relations. But we do not at
                            present know anyone except <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName> among these leaders, and he is the least
                            influential. Nor do we have a particularly aggressive Ambassador in
                            Algiers. (S)</p>

                        <p>We may want to think of a series of visits simply as a way of getting to
                            know the new leadership. For example, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName>,

                            and I could all find reasons to go over the next year or so. At a time
                            when we are not doing very well keeping old friends in the Middle East,
                            we should not pass up the chance to get off to a good start with the new
                            Algerian leadership. We do not have much to offer them
                            concretely—although our private sector does—but we nonetheless have
                            interests in the area that will be served by better U.S.-Algerian

                        <p>When he seized power in 1965 from Ahmed Ben Bella, independent Algeria’s
                            first ruler, <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> created a
                            26-man Council of the Revolution. Composed primarily of military
                            officers who had supported his takeover, the Council was a collective
                            leadership group in which <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s status was that of first among equals. In
                            the intervening years the Council has lost members and influence as
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> out-maneuvered his
                            rivals and asserted his political dominance. Since <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> became ill, the eight active
                            surviving members of the Council have taken the reins of government in
                            hand. They are of the Algerian political establishment and probably will
                            designate, and to a major extent serve as <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s successors, providing considerable
                            continuity in state policy.</p>
                        <p>Algeria’s leaders are extraordinarily secretive, a characteristic not
                            unrelated to their clandestine experiences during Algeria’s independence
                            struggle. We have had almost no access to most members of the
                            Revolutionary Council and have little meaningful secondhand intelligence
                            about them. Our imperfect understanding is that there currently are at
                            least two major factions within the Council. One, headed by Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Abdelaziz Bouteflika</persName>, is
                            considered more interested in good relations with the West than the
                            other, which is headed by Party Chief Mohamed Yahiaoui. The two other
                            key members of the Council seem to be Oran Military District Commander
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Chadly Bendjedid</persName>, who has the
                            support of some other senior military officers, and Interior Minister
                            Mohamed Abdelghani. The loyalties, if any, of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> and Abdelghani are uncertain.
                            Unclear also are the preferences of less influential Council
                            members.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing there are wide gaps in our intelligence, we have concluded
                            nevertheless that to preserve their status the Council members will
                            patch over their differences and reestablish collegial leadership. This
                            is consistent with the risk minimizing and turf protective propensities
                            in Algerian political life. It also is what appears to be occurring at
                            present and it is the pattern which first followed independence and was
                            adopted by <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> at the
                            beginning of his own reign.</p>
                        <p>Over time however we would expect the evolution which then occurred under
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> to be repeated—one
                            member of the collegium eventually will become dominant. Although it is
                            difficult to predict, the final struggle may well be among a leading
                            military figure such as <persName corresp="#p_BC_1"
                            >Bendjedid</persName>, who would have significant Army support;
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>, with the backing
                            of moderates and technocrats; and Yahiaoui, with student and Party
                            support. The successful contender would not be able to rely exclusively
                            on his initial power base but would have to expand it at the expense of
                            his competitors. An essential element would be his acceptability to
                            senior military officers.</p>
                        <p>Algerians outside the Council could make a bid for power. Only two of the
                            six regional military commanders are Council members. No <pb n="180"
                                facs="0201" xml:id="pg_180"/>unit commanders, most of whom we cannot
                            even identify, are on the Council. The presence of powerful Islamic
                            currents within Algerian society, including the apparent organization of
                            conservative Muslims in the civilian sector, makes it possible there is
                            some cohesion among fundamentalist officers and NCO’s. However, the
                            Council appears to have the country in hand. It has instructed the Army
                            and the Party to maintain order, and it has the security services
                            watching each other and the Army. The 4,000 Americans in Algeria
                            therefore are believed to be in little danger at present.</p>
                        <p>The Algerian Constitution would make National Assembly President Rabah
                            Bitat interim Chief of State during the 45 days following <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s death. He is an ideal
                            figurehead: one of the founders of the Algerian revolution and a man of
                            modest ambition. The Council probably will follow constitutional
                            provisions to the extent of allowing Bitat to assume the Presidency for
                            the interim period. It is less clear what will happen thereafter. The
                            Constitution says the Party is to meet and nominate a successor, whose
                            mandate would be affirmed in a general election. Although a Party
                            Congress is tentatively scheduled for 1979, there has been no Party
                            Congress since the sixties, and the Council might not feel confident it
                            could control one now.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the Council decides, it clearly must bring into senior
                            leadership positions representatives of the technocrats needed to
                            administer the Government. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> included them in his cabinet, and this could
                            be the procedure followed again. However, the relationship between the
                            Council, which has no constitutional standing, and a cabinet would be
                            awkward. One possible solution would be for the Council members to take
                            for themselves the principal state and army offices either held by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> or vacant at the
                            time of his death. In addition to the Presidency, these include the
                            positions of Vice President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and
                            Chief of Staff.</p>

                        <p>It is unclear who, if anyone, would dominate an “interim” collective
                            leadership. <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>’s health
                            is uncertain and his acceptability to the Army doubtful. Yahiaoui is
                            almost totally unknown to us, and <persName corresp="#p_BC_1"
                                >Bendjedid</persName>’s ambitions are believed limited to retaining
                            control of his Oran fiefdom. The international orientations of the
                            Council’s leading figures also are obscure. Although he defends
                            articulately Soviet positions in exchanges with American officials,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> is said to value
                            Algeria’s connections with the West, and to be distrusted by the
                            Soviets. The Soviets and radical Arabs are said to favor Yahiaoui, but
                            this is the only evidence we have that he may be any more sympathetic to
                            their ideologies than <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                            >Boumediene</persName>.</p>
                        <p>No major reorientation of Algeria’s domestic and international policies
                            is likely, although the new leadership, at least initially, might <pb
                                n="181" facs="0202" xml:id="pg_181"/>be less active internationally.
                            Whoever governs Algeria is expected to recognize that Western
                            technology, finance and marketing are essential to the development of
                            Algeria’s hydrocarbon sector, and that the earnings from this sector are
                            the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> for Algerian growth. We
                            therefore would expect a continuation of Algeria’s extensive economic
                            ties with the United States (i.e., $1.4 billion in Exim credits) and
                            other Western Governments without any letup in criticism of Western
                            economic “imperialism”. Algerian petroleum exports (8 percent of our oil
                            imports) also will continue. There is little basis to hope that the
                            Algerians will turn away from their military assistance relationship
                            with the Soviets, but good reason to believe that as ardent nationalists
                            they will guard their independence zealously. On the Middle East, any
                            change probably would be marginal, which means they will remain in the
                            steadfastness camp and are unlikely to give our peacemaking efforts any
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Mismanagement, corruption and shortages of consumer goods have eroded
                            much of the public support <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>’s regime won by bringing order to a nation
                            still divided after independence. New leaders might seek public favor by
                            allowing the private sector a larger role at the margins of what will
                            remain a socialized economy. Given public apathy about Algeria’s role in
                            the Sahara conflict, and the popular impression this is responsible for
                            some of the country’s economic problems, new leaders might be more
                            willing to compromise than <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName>. For him the war by proxy against <persName

                            While this is not a top-priority foreign policy issue, it is worth
                            doing, particularly at a time when our position in the Middle East is

                            cabinet ministers on arrival and given the best accommodations. We had
                            no significant opportunities for official contacts, but there were no

                        <p>I wish to extend to you my best wishes upon your inauguration as
                            President of Algeria. The United States attaches great importance to its
                            relations with Algeria, which plays a significant role in world affairs.
                            I look forward to continuing growth in the relations between our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="0207" xml:id="pg_186"/>
                        <p>In recent years there has been a mutually beneficial expansion of
                            economic relations between our two nations in energy and other fields.
                            American technology, financing, and commercial ties can continue to
                            offer positive benefits for Algeria’s development. We are particularly
                            pleased to have so many young Algerians in our universities. Their
                            presence enriches the educational experiences of our own students, and
                            the knowledge and skills they acquire here will help enable them to
                            contribute to the development and progress of their own country.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Mr. President, we have enjoyed a useful exchange of views
                            with senior officials of the Algerian Government, including your
                            predecessor. I regret that President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> was unable to make a state visit to the

                            you could expect a reception that would be correct, verging on cool; if

                            to hear you out). In either case it would be a useful stop, and for
                            essentially the same reasons as for Algeria (authoritative statement of
                            our policy). At the same time, you could well be the one to <hi

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I am pleased to inform you personally that Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName>, my Assistant for
                            National Security Affairs, is leading the American delegation to your
                            celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the Algerian revolution.
                            The happiness of this occasion is in strong contrast to the sorrow which
                            we shared with the Algerian nation less than a year ago at the funeral
                            of the late President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"

                        <p>This year’s national day celebrations will also provide a special
                            opportunity for a high-level discussion of our common concerns. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> has my full
                            confidence and looks forward to such a discussion with you. I hope that
                            you will receive him and talk with him as freely and frankly as you
                            would with me about the matters that so concern us both in this critical
                            period. He will report personally to me upon his return to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that our mutual interest in encouraging the development of
                            international understanding and cooperation will continue to guide our
                            relations. In particular, my country desires to build on the
                            constructive bilateral ties which our two nations already enjoy. I view
                            our mutual relations as important to the development and progress which
                            I know both of us desire to see in the North African region.</p>

                            the President, by sending him to Algeria, wanted to outline the
                            importance of our relations with Algeria; he had asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to explain to the Foreign
                            Minister and President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName>
                            the basic points of United States foreign policy in the Middle East; and
                            more specifically to outline the reasons underlying the President’s arms
                            supply decision on Morocco. (C)</p>
                        <p>In developing these views, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> added that he
                            wished to summarize very briefly a number of key ideas: First, the
                            President and the United States Government accept the reality of
                            fundamental change in the world. We live in a period marked by a major
                            redistribution of political power, reflecting changes which in a sense
                            started with the shots fired in 1945 at Setif.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d75fn2">On May 8, 1945, French police fired on Algerians
                                protesting colonial rule in the town of Sétif.</note> We have seen
                            the end of the Eurocentric era, and while we accept this change, we
                            insist that it be stable, constructive, and lead to conditions which are
                            both peaceful and equitable. We are not interested in defending the
                            status quo, but at the same time we will not permit other powers to
                            exploit changes for their own ends. We view the non-aligned movement as
                            a constructive element in world <pb n="193" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_193"
                            />affairs and we especially appreciate the important role which Algeria
                            plays in that context. (U)</p>

                            Minister that we expect neither Algerian approval nor support for our
                            Middle East policy; we would, however, like Algeria to understand that
                            policy. The President’s Administration, he noted, is the first
                            Democratic Administration to work for peace in the Middle East on a
                            basis other than maximalist Israeli positions. We are not supporting a
                            separate Israeli-Egyptian agreement; rather we want to use the
                            Israeli-Egyptian agreements as a catalyst leading to a larger
                            settlement. We will try, in the next phase of negotiations, to move
                            toward Palestinian autonomy. We hope to draw some moderate Palestinians
                            directly into this process. We hope transitional arrangements will
                            emerge which will, in time, modify both Israeli and Palestinian
                            expectations, out of which will come eventual recognition of Israel’s
                            right to exist. Our policy is based on the premise that Palestinians
                            have the right to participate in the shaping of their own future. We
                            expect this process to move forward, with the result that there will be
                            both restoration of territories and self-government—for Arabs in general
                            and for the Palestinians in particular. We recognize and respect the
                            Arab renaissance and consider it in the United States interest to have
                            friendly relations with as many Arab countries as possible. In this
                            connection we want better relations with Iraq and Libya. (U)</p>
                        <p>Concerning Morocco, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                    >Brzezinski</persName></hi> stressed that the arms decision we
                            took was based on three things: first, the solution to the Western
                            Saharan conflict should be political not military; second, we are not
                            supporting Morocco in order to enable it to seek a military solution;
                            rather we want to encourage Morocco, on the basis of stability and
                            confidence, to seek a political settlement; third, we think it important
                            that our friends know they can count on the United States and that the
                            United States will not let military solutions be imposed upon them.

                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> added that we are not seeking to mediate
                            this conflict—none of the parties have asked us to be a mediator and we
                            are not volunteering—but we will be using whatever influence we have to
                            urge others to join us in encouraging the parties to look for a
                            political solution. The North African region has enormous potential; its
                            resources are such that it could easily become a new Ruhr. We are
                            confident that neither Algeria nor Morocco wants a war, and we are thus
                            doing what we can to help promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> went on to note that we consider Algeria
                            an important actor, both regionally and internationally. Algeria has
                            high standing in the non-aligned movement and in the international
                            community. Algeria’s struggle for independence confers prestige upon it,
                            as does <pb n="194" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_194"/>the role played by
                            religion in Algerian national life and the fact that in international
                            affairs Algeria speaks for itself. We are encouraged by our growing
                            economic relations and believe that the time has come for more frequent
                            contacts between our two countries in political affairs. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> concluded his presentation by noting
                            that, while he didn’t expect our two governments to agree on everything,
                            he didn’t think we have any fundamental conflicts. We both agree on the
                            need to keep foreign military presence and ideological pressures out of
                            Africa. We respect religious principles and the natural desire of people
                            to participate in organizing their futures. We are both conscious of the
                            gradual redistribution of political power taking place which will affect
                            events until the end of this century and beyond. On all of these issues
                            there is enough common ground to enable us to speak seriously to one
                            another. (U)</p>
                        <p>In response, and before delivering his own presentation, <hi
                                rend="italic">Foreign Minister Benyahia</hi> asked why Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> had not mentioned the words
                                “<gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>” or “Palestinian State” in his
                            remarks concerning the Middle East. <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> replied that he
                            had wished to stress the basic tenets of our policy rather than specify
                            solutions. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Minister Benyahia</hi> went on to note that
                            Algeria is very appreciative of the President’s gesture in sending Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to Algeria for
                            the 25th Anniversary observance of the Algerian Revolution. Contacts
                            between our two countries have not been frequent, which Algeria does not
                            consider a good thing. So far as developing a dialogue is concerned, we
                            are in agreement and we want this dialogue to be open and permanent. So
                            far as international affairs are concerned, Foreign Minister Benyahia
                            stressed that Algeria had acquired its independence through suffering
                            and struggle. Accordingly, a fundamental basis of Algerian policy is its
                            support for national independence. Algeria is excessively sensitive to
                            the struggle of others for self-determination, and sometimes has gone
                            against its own interest in asserting this principle (when Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asked for specific
                            examples, Benyahia cited Algeria’s severance of relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UK_1"
                                >UK</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> over the
                            Middle East—moves which hurt a developing country like Algeria from an
                            economic point of view). (C)</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Palestinian question in the Middle East, <hi rend="italic"
                                >Foreign Minister Benyahia</hi> said that Algeria saw this in the
                            same way that it saw Rhodesia, Namibia and the former Portuguese African
                            colonies. People must have the right to independence; the Palestinian
                            people’s existence in negotiations can only be undertaken with those who
                            represent and carry on alone the struggle of the people. History without
                            exception shows that those are the only ones who validly express the
                            people’s interest, a point which also applies to the Saharan conflict.
                                <pb n="195" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_195"/>The Foreign Minister said
                            he did not want to employ adjectives that are too extreme, but the least
                            he could say about our policy in the Middle East was that it was
                            “unrealistic.” Any process which implicitly or explicitly aimed at
                            eliminating the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> will inevitably
                            lead to a large-scale confrontation in the Middle East. (C)</p>
                        <p>Speaking at much greater length on the Western Saharan conflict, <hi
                                rend="italic">Foreign Minister Benyahia</hi> said he did not wish to
                            get into a discussion which would question the friendship of one people
                            against another people. However, if he were to rephrase Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s position it would seem
                            that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is against the
                            self-determination of people who are opposed by friends of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. The basic facts of the Western Saharan
                            situation are that Morocco, by force of arms, now occupies a territory
                            previously held by the Spanish and that the people living there want
                            their independence. These facts have led to a decolonization struggle.
                            Either one is for self-determination, against it or neutral in this
                            struggle. Each of these positions dictates certain actions. However, one
                            thing is clear, you cannot claim neutrality while supplying one of the
                            parties to the conflict the means of military repression. (C)</p>
                        <p>Developing further his points, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                Minister</hi> wondered where Morocco really thought its borders were
                            located and then alluded to the claims Morocco made as far as Timbuktu.
                            Benyahia said he did not want to make a comparison with Israel, adding
                            Morocco was one of the rare states in the world that wanted to have
                            “elastic frontiers.” The Sahara conflict is one involving the right of a
                            colonial people to self-determination, something that is not
                            “negotiable.” The situation is not similar to that of the Algerian
                            liberation struggle where the Algerians had something to negotiate over
                            with the French; i.e., rights of French citizens remaining in Algeria
                            and the commercial interests of French companies in Algeria. The
                            difficulties that Morocco is having in the Sahara are not due to a lack
                            of military equipment. They are due to a lack of moral justification.
                            Additional arms to Morocco will not change the situation at all. In sum,
                            said Benyahia, Algeria did not find American rationale for its supply
                            policy convincing. Reinforcing Morocco to negotiate would mean
                            negotiations at the expense of the Saharan people’s right of
                            self-determination, a point which led Benyahia to comment on the
                            question of bilateral relations. He stressed that Algeria was ready to
                            discuss peace, but it continues to refuse two things: (1) the idea that
                            the Western Saharan conflict could be considered a bilateral affair
                            between Morocco and Algeria; (2) that Algeria can be the agent to
                            discuss the future of the Saharan people with third parties. Since the
                            existence of the first liberation movements, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has tended to attribute communist
                            motives to them. Such an interpretation is worthy of “cartoons.” Our
                            Charge in Washington reports that one of your staff told him that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> knew of the existence of an
                            accord <pb n="196" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_196"/>between Libya and
                            Algeria to use the Tuareg Tribesmen of Mali and Niger to destabilize
                            their respective governments. This allegation prompted us to call on the
                            governments of those two countries to see whether they believed such an
                            allegation. Before making up its mind, the Foreign Minister urged the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to contact the allegedly
                            threatened governments. Algeria’s policy, he said, is not to meddle in
                            the affairs of its neighbors; the only problem Algeria has with Morocco
                            is based on that country’s policy of expansionism. (C)</p>
                        <p>On the subject of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Algerian relations,
                                <hi rend="italic">Benyahia</hi> agreed with Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> that since Algeria’s
                            independence there have been no direct issues of disagreement between
                            us. Economic ties have grown to such a state that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is now Algeria’s number one economic
                            partner, with France in third place. Algeria would like to expand those
                            ties even more. At the same time, however, Algeria does not want the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to become a factor of
                            destabilization in the region. Benyahia emphasized in this context that
                            the American arms supply initiative causes Algeria enormous disquiet and
                            concern. He likened <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy to the
                            plight of a businessman who invests in a bankrupted business, since
                            Algeria is convinced that arms to Morocco, no matter in what quantity,
                            cannot bring stability, expecially for Morocco itself. <hi rend="italic"
                                >The Foreign Minister</hi> said that for <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Algerian relations to remain excellent, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> must not contribute to destabilization
                            in the region. The <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is investing in
                            a “rotten regime” in Morocco and, therefore, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> arms will neither stabilize the region nor defeat the
                            Polisario. Referring to the experience of recent history, the Foreign
                            Minister pointed out that each time a power attempted to stop the
                            process of self-determination, that power itself became destabilized. He
                            cited, as examples, the cases of France with respect to Algeria and

                            Algeria knows the King, but doesn’t know what might follow him. It could
                            be even more expansionist. (C)</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, <hi rend="italic">Foreign Minister Benyahia</hi> said he
                            was in agreement with a need to develop our relations. He agreed too
                            with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s points
                            concerning a new economic order and the redistribution of political
                            power. The more we discuss these problems, he said the better we will

                            the frankness with which it was delivered. He said that he felt it was
                            fair to conclude that there were two issues which, while not central to
                            our relations, were nevertheless important and on which we do not agree:
                            the Palestinian question and Morocco. He wished to make a brief
                            observation on each of these two issues. (C)</p>

                        <p>On Palestine, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                    >Brzezinski</persName></hi> questioned the Foreign Minister’s
                            analogy between the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and Algeria’s
                            own revolutionary experience. He agreed on the importance of recognizing
                            the principal combatants; adding while it was true that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FLN_1">FLN</gloss> was the principal combatant during
                            Algeria’s independence struggle, the fact is that the principal
                            combatants in the Middle East have not been the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> but rather Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> stressed that he did not
                            ignore the importance of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> but he
                            did not feel that its experience was comparable to that of the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted, he has often said
                            that if the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> ever fought like the
                                <gloss target="#t_FLN_1">FLN</gloss>, Israel would be in serious

                        <p>A seond important difference between the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FLN_1">FLN</gloss>, <hi
                                rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> continued, is that in all the latter’s
                            documents there was a readiness to sign a treaty with France provided
                            France recognized Algerian rights. The <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> on the other hand does not accept an internationally
                            acceptable platform for a Middle East framework of peace, embodied in
                                <gloss target="#t_UNSC_1">UNSC</gloss> Resolutions 242 and 338. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> added that he
                            made this observation not for polemical reasons but because unless
                            certain distinctions were made clear, historic analogies can be
                            seriously misleading. We do not exclude the role of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>—there is a process of change, and in
                            this process there will be greater recognition of Palestinian rights.
                            The resignation of Dayan and Abba Eban’s speech are indicators of that
                            recognition within Israel itself.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">Israeli
                                Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan resigned on October 21 over differences
                                with Menachem Begin regarding Palestinian autonomy and the West
                                Bank. Abba Eban’s speech is not further identified.</note> In
                            response to the Foreign Minister’s contentions that we are pursuing an
                            erroneous policy, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            said he felt obliged to point out that Arab policy in all the years past
                            did not recover a single inch of Arab territory held by Israel. <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy is bringing that restoration
                            about, and once the Sinai is restored, along with autonomy in Gaza and
                            the West Bank, the stage will be set for further progress—and that is
                            the reason why extremist elements in Israel oppose this because they see
                            where it is leading. (C)</p>
                        <p>On Morocco, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                    >Brzezinski</persName></hi> reemphasized that we are not
                            assisting Morocco to impose its maximalist position. We are, however,
                            worried by potential disruption in Morocco’s political life and the
                            possible collapse of the King. The problem is that Morocco’s perception
                            of the Western Sahara is completely different from Algeria’s. Morocco,
                            and even Tunisia, say Algeria is the dynamic and expansionist power in
                            the area. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> went on to stress the need for dealing
                            with subjective perceptions because they motivate people no matter how
                            ridiculous <pb n="198" facs="0219" xml:id="pg_198"/>the perceptions
                            might seem to others. For our part, we will be using our leverage to
                            promote a political solution. Some of our common friends will do the
                            same. What we cannot permit is a situation to develop where one side
                            gets massive outside assistance while the other becomes progressively
                            isolated and forced to accept an imposed solution. It is this
                            consideration which has led us to undertake talks with Morocco and
                            others. We have no hidden motives. We are not trying by subterfuge to
                            help Morocco prevail in a military sense. Finally, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> concluded, we don’t feel we
                            have to choose between our friendship with Morocco and our growing
                            relations and friendship with Algeria. Many of the things he has said,
                            he added, the Foreign Minister will disagree with or reject. But so will
                            the Moroccans. The important thing is to seek a political accommodation.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Foreign Minister</hi> pointed out that the Moroccan
                            King speaks of the “right of hot pursuit” into Algeria. He felt it
                            necessary to point out that if Morocco ever resorts to hot pursuit, then
                            there will be a broader conflict. He continued by asking Dr. <persName

                            rigidly adheres to those principles of the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> Charter calling for the respect of the rights of the
                            people of the continent and for national borders. He chucklingly told
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> that the latter
                            was “insulting” Morocco when he said that the Polisario has enormous
                            military might while Morocco has inadequate means. The Foreign Minister
                            suggested that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> send a State
                            Department mission to visit the Polisario on the spot to see the amount

                            Moroccans. With time running out before Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName>’s next appointment with the Iranian Prime
                            Minister and Foreign Minister, the Foreign Minister indicated that
                            allegations of Tunisian fears of Algerian domination seemed to him
                            incredible. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> took his leave in reemphasizing his

                            occasion. Rather, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            said that he wished to underline a fundamental belief: while we may
                            disagree on this issue or that, on the basics we do not disagree at all.
                            We believe that the world is in the midst of fundamental change. We
                            believe that Algeria is a very important regional and international
                            force in that process. Algeria speaks for itself in international fora
                            and for no one else. We respect Algerian independence, we understand its
                            sources, and we understand Algeria’s influence on others. For all of
                            these reasons, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            continued, we believe the time is ripe for more frequent contacts. We
                            are prepared to engage in a serious dialogue with Algeria on all the
                            major issues of concern to us both. We feel strongly that Algeria has a
                            very major role to play, and we want to collaborate with Algeria as
                            closely as possible. (U)</p>

                            anyone who had participated in the attempted coup. Algeria believed in
                            the principle of good relations with its neighbors; it never tried to
                            export its revolutionary experience to Morocco, nor create problems
                            there. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> knows this.

                            Western Sahara, and our perceptions there were different. Algeria’s is
                            based on the principle of self-determination for all people, a principle
                            which it has believed in since the organization of its revolution. It is
                            also a principle shared by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. Algeria believes that the

                            organize its own life. Unless this principle is applied, <pb n="201"

                            precedent in Africa, in effect a return to jungle law where smaller
                            countries will be at the mercy of larger countries. This would lead to
                            instability in the continent. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1"
                                    >Bendjedid</persName></hi> reiterated that Algeria has no claim
                            in the Western Sahara. The problem there is between the Saharan people,
                            who want self-determination, and another power which is using force
                            against them. Algeria supports any and all liberation forces. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> had said before to
                            the American Ambassador that before the Western Sahara problem had
                            arisen Algeria had very good relations with Morocco. The President
                            wanted Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to know
                            that Algeria’s principles are the same regardless of the monarchial
                            system in Morocco. That system concerns only the Moroccan people.
                            Algeria has no right to concern itself with Morocco’s internal affairs,
                            but if it did have to pronounce a view, it would say that Moroccan
                            stability is in Algeria’s interest. The President wishes King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> himself would recognize that
                            Algeria does not want to make any problem. The most important thing for
                            Algeria is to work for the improvement in the lives of its own people,
                            to help the nation achieve development. Having fought for 7½ years,
                            Algeria knows all the dangers of conflict, perhaps better than anybody
                            else in the region. (C)</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of arms supply to Morocco, <hi rend="italic"
                                >President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName></hi>
                            expressed the view that this could lead Morocco to try to oppress its
                            neighbors. To understand the importance of the Polisario fighting in the
                            south, it is necessary to come back to the origins of the conflict: it
                            is Morocco which oppressed the Sahara people, not the contrary. The role
                            that Algeria played between the Polisario and Mauritania demonstrates
                            its peaceful intentions so far as that conflict is concerned. (C)</p>
                        <p>At this point <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                    >Brzezinski</persName></hi> expressed the hope that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> would permit him to
                            use Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TAG_1">Toumayan</persName> as his
                            interpreter. Sometimes, he said, he speaks in a way that is deliberately
                            enigmatic, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TAG_1">Toumayan</persName> is
                            accustomed to this. He went on to say that he had found the President’s
                            views, as well as the Foreign Minister’s, extremely beneficial. These
                            will enable him to return to Washington and to report to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> with a clearer
                            understanding of Algerian foreign policy and a better understanding of
                            Algerian concerns. He will also go back with the feeling that in terms
                            of fundamental conceptions of world affairs, there is no real conflict
                            between Algeria and the United States. (C)</p>
                        <p>Concerning the differences which have surfaced, <hi rend="italic">Dr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi>
                            continued, these strike him as essentially practical in nature; he can
                            detect no fundamental strategic difference. He was very reassured by the
                            President’s emphasis and that of the Foreign Minister on the need for
                            political contacts. We share that view. On the question of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> arms <pb n="202" facs="0223"
                                xml:id="pg_202"/>for Morocco, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> indicated that he would comment briefly. He
                            was enormously impressed by the military parade which he had the
                            privilege of seeing the day before. He noted that while he was not a
                            military technician, he did have the impression that not all of the arms
                            shown in the parade were of local manufacture. Moreover, some of the
                            weapons <hi rend="italic">not</hi> produced in Algeria impressed him as
                            being very modern. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> thought that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> would have far greater cause
                            for concern if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had already given
                            the same level of arms to Morocco. What we are giving the King does not
                            match what Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> had
                            seen the day before. In any event, the purpose of our arms is to ensure
                            that the King, who is a source of stability in Morocco, does not feel
                            cornered in a difficult situation. (S)</p>

                                    >Bendjedid</persName></hi> replied that he would like to
                            underline a point: if Algeria seeks modern armaments, it is not to
                            oppress a neighbor. It has never used arms against its neighbors.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> asserted that
                            he had personally attended meetings in international fora where the King
                            recognized that there was no border problem with Algeria. Algeria has
                            neither expansionist policy, nor soldiers outside its frontiers. On the
                            other hand, Morocco does have an expansionist policy—indirectly against
                            Algeria and Mauritania, directly against the Western Sahara people.
                            Having this point of view, Morocco could create a real danger in the
                            region. President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName>
                            believes that all the big powers, especially the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>, should prevent any country in the region from having
                            such a policy. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>’ own interests in
                            the region would thereby be served. (C)</p>

                            essential underpinning of Algerian national life; Algeria had suffered
                            too much to desire anything different. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> went on to say that besides wanting
                            peace, Algeria was the strongest power in the region. It could feel
                            secure about its peace. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> certainly
                            has no intention of supporting anyone against Algeria. We intend to use
                            the political leverage we have to encourage Morocco, and others who are
                            our friends, to seek a peaceful solution. We do not underestimate the
                            potential destructiveness of the Western Sahara conflict. It threatens
                            not only Morocco, our traditional friend, but everyone else in the area.
                            One cannot predict the consequences of an awakened political
                            consciousness of the Saharan people as a whole. It might not be possible
                            to circumscribe a conflict in its present area. <pb n="203" facs="0224"
                                xml:id="pg_203"/>One cannot exclude the possibility of a spillover
                            which would invite an East-West ideological confrontation. (S)</p>

                            ideological problem in the Western Sahara. (C)</p>

                            should the conflict expand. One cannot predict the implications of such
                            a conflict, one could make no firm assumptions. In any case, he wished
                            to underline the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> desire for the most
                            rapid end of the conflict. The question is how and what will be the
                            solution. We have no prescription. We will encourage our friends to seek
                            a political accommodation; we will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> encourage
                            our friends to seek a military solution. We respect the principle of
                            self-determination. That in turn raises the question of how to move in
                            the direction of a solution based on principles shared by <hi
                                rend="italic">all</hi> the parties. At present, there is a division
                            between the sides which excludes shared principles. But with patience
                            and encouragement from friends, that division can be narrowed, and
                            things which seem difficult or impossible to one or the other parties
                            now can become acceptable. The important thing is to avoid creating a
                            situation where one of the two parties feels compelled toward acts of
                            desperation or provocation. (S)</p>

                            the two sides Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> had
                            in mind? (C)</p>
                        <p>Morocco and those who oppose Morocco, <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName></hi> replied. He added
                            that he didn’t really know who was opposing Morocco, but he assumed that
                            everyone in the room knew. He went on to assure the President that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> is engaging in discussions with
                            our friends, which aren’t easy, to encourage them to look at the
                            realities in a peaceful and practical fashion. At this stage, we do not
                            think it is possible to envisage the details of a peaceful solution, but
                            that can be possible once a process has been started which can lead to a
                            serious dialogue. (C)</p>

                                >OAU</gloss>, an organization which has designated a committee to

                            friends should work with the committee to lead Morocco to adopt a

                            every avenue that might lead to peace. We ourselves are not prepared to
                            become a mediator—we have the impression that neither Algeria nor
                            Morocco desires us to play this role. (C)</p>

                            had meant to say. There is an existing framework for peace, which has

                                Central Foreign Policy File, D790509–1095)</note> after his meeting
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName>, and he
                            expected that this issue would be discussed further. All he is saying at
                            present is that we will be exploring all ways to peace. Morocco and
                            Algeria are Arab countries; there are many different ways to encourage
                            the parties toward peace in that context. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1"
                                    >Bendjedid</persName></hi> assured Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> that Algeria will welcome
                            any initiatives leading to peace and stability in the conflict. It will
                            be in Algeria’s interest to do so. Though Algeria is not directly
                            involved in the conflict, it is in Algeria’s interest to see it
                            resolved. He then asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> if the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            believes in self-determination as a principle. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> answered yes. However, he added,
                            self-determination is only one principle; non-use of force is another;
                            national security is a third. He was sure that we both shared these.

                            principles; he wished to underline that aspect. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> reiterated that he did not believe that
                            any fundamental conflict divided us on the question of principles or the
                            application of these, either on this continent or anywhere else. We feel
                            that the Non-Aligned Movement is a positive force in world affairs. This
                            is a change in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy from past
                            Administrations. We feel that countries such as Algeria and Yugoslavia
                            are providing leadership in a constructive way. This is an historically
                            important development, because it implies a waning in previously intense
                            ideological divisions. During many years in the West, for example, the
                            concept of socialism was associated with atheism. Algeria is
                            demonstrating that socialism and religion were compatible. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1"
                                    >Bendjedid</persName></hi> said he would like to stress the fact
                            that Algeria continues to follow the same line as it builds its society.
                            No one could make Algeria communist. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName></hi> stated that he has never suspected the
                            Algerian people or its leadership of sympathy for Communism; still,
                            before his visit, he had underestimated the extent to which the Algerian
                            people were attracted to religion. As a young student and academician he
                            had thought of the Algerian struggle as more of a political and national
                            phenomenon rather than religious. The resurgence of religion in national
                            life is something which Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> finds especially fascinating. In America we
                            neither fear this nor object to it. We welcome it, <pb n="205"

                            and systemic mosaic we see as the ideal for a world of pluralism and
                            diversity. If he were a Soviet leader, he added, he would be greatly
                            concerned by this trend. He would have to ask himself, everytime
                            greetings appeared in Pravda from the Socialist and Democratic Republic
                            of Algeria, what the 65 million Moslems living in the Soviet Union were
                            likely to think. He could imagine people from Tashkent saying “Why can’t
                            I have my own mosque, my own flag, my own country?” (C)</p>

                            how fruitful he felt his talk with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> had been. Algeria and the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> both favored a cooperative relationship.
                            As regards the Western Sahara, he believes that the <gloss

                            is confident about <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> intentions there.
                            He asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to relay

                            Relations</p>
                        <p>A. The Algerian leadership is realistic, hardheaded and very religious.
                            This religious aspect was stronger than I had expected and is very
                            explicitly stressed in their pronouncements and activities.</p>
                        <p>B. The Algerians resent the Cuban role in the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1"
                                >NAM</gloss> and there is growing dislike for the Soviet Union
                            because of the Soviet mistreatment of its Muslims.</p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="0227" xml:id="pg_206"/>
                        <p>C. The Algerians are critical of our Moroccan decision but listened to my
                            explanations and by their words and deeds seemed to imply that it should
                            not affect the bilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Algerian
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>D. I believe that my visit, and especially the conversation with the
                            President and Foreign Minister, in addition to my deliberate public
                            display of respect for the martyrs of the Algerian revolution, made an
                            impact on the Algerians. I believe that the time is ripe for closer
                            political and military contacts, and both <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> and State should be instructed to pursue all
                            opportunities. The Algerian leadership was especially receptive to my
                            statement to the effect that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> approves of the non-aligned movement and
                            especially of Algeria’s role in it (“We respect Algeria because we know
                            that when Algeria speaks, it speaks for itself and no one else.”).</p>
                        <p>E. Finally, I think the <gloss target="#t_VOA_1">VOA</gloss> should be
                            instructed to step up its broadcasts to Arab countries on the subject of
                            the Soviet mistreatment of its Muslims, especially with regard to denial
                            of religious opportunities.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is material unrelated to Algeria.]</p>
                        <p>I come back convinced that Algeria is going to become the dominant force
                            on the North African Continent. I believe we can work with it if we are
                            firm in stating clearly what our objectives are, and if at the same time
                            we indicate our positive appraisal of their role and respect for their
                            independence. The judgment both of my Algerian hosts and U.S. Ambassador
                            was that the visit was timely and constructive; the Algerians gave every
                            impression of being delighted by it and went out of their way through a
                            variety of small symbolic gestures to highlight my presence and to
                            display warm feelings towards you as well as myself.</p>
                        <p>I also gave a TV interview, and visited the revolutionary sites outside
                            of Algiers.</p>

                            this afternoon. Malek stressed Algeria’s determination to broaden

                            that the Iran and Afghanistan situations offered grounds for closer

                                January 21, the Department provided a detailed account of the
                                meeting between <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and
                                Malek. (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D800036–0466)</note> He personally thought the non-aligned movement
                            should take a position against the Soviet invasion. I pressed him to
                            urge that the Algerian Ambassador in Tehran try hard again to gain
                            access to our hostages. He agreed.</p>
                        <p>On the Sahara, he agreed on the need for an early, peaceful solution
                            based on a compromise settlement. I suggested that Algeria discuss the
                            Sahara bilaterally with the Moroccans in the first instance, rather than
                            insisting that the Moroccans talk first to the Polisario. (<persName

                            may already have started.) Malek expressed uneasiness over the
                            forthcoming testimony to Congress on the Moroccan arms package, and
                            hoped it would not have a negative impact on our relationship. I assured
                            him that we would make clear our arms are designed to promote a
                            negotiated settlement, not to win a war.</p>

                            Assistant Secretary Day called in Libyan Charge to deliver protest note
                            concerning incident January 27 when U.S. Navy plane was harassed in
                            mid-air over international waters by two Libyan Mirages. Charge asked if
                            we expected <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> response and was told
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would be interested in any
                            explanation <gloss target="#t_LARG_1">LARG</gloss> prepared to give.
                            Details of incident are included in note, text of which follows.</p>
                        <p>2. Begin quote. The Department of State wishes to inform the Embassy of
                            the Libyan Arab Republic that on the morning of January 27, 1977, two
                            Libyan Mirage aircraft engaged in irresponsible and extremely dangerous
                            maneuvers over international waters which threatened the safety of a
                            United States Government airplane at latitude 34–09 north, longitude
                            13–08 east beginning at 10:32 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time.</p>
                        <p>The two Libyan aircraft approached an unarmed United States military
                            aircraft from the southeast, coming to within 200 feet of the United
                            States aircraft which was flying at an altitude of 13,500 feet. One of
                            the Libyan fighters then maneuvered directly over the American aircraft
                            by rolling from a position on the American aircraft’s left to its right,
                            and accelerated so as to pass directly ahead of the American aircraft at
                            a distance of 200 feet. The two Libyan aircraft then took up a position
                            approximately two miles behind the American aircraft, one Libyan
                            aircraft performed a maneuver similar to a gunnery approach, and the
                            United States aircraft was illuminated with Libyan fire control radar
                            until approximately 10:43 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Throughout its
                            flight, the United States aircraft never proceeded closer than 53
                            nautical miles from Libyan territory, and the dangerous maneuvers
                            described took place approximately 75 nautical miles north of
                            Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government hereby protests in the strongest terms that
                            the actions of the Libyan aircraft constituted an extreme hazard to the
                            safe navigation of the American aircraft over the high <pb n="209"
                                facs="0230" xml:id="pg_209"/>seas, and were in violation of
                            international standards of aviation safety. The United States Government
                            would consider it a dangerous and unfriendly act should such an incident
                            recur and would hold the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic fully
                            accountable for any future incidents in which United States aircraft
                            transiting international air space were threatened. End quote.</p>

                        <p>2. Begin text: The Embassy of the United States of America refers to the
                            Ministry’s note of February 7, 1977, concerning the encounter between a
                            United States military aircraft and Libyan Air Force planes on January
                                27.<note n="4" xml:id="d81fn4">See <ref target="#d79fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 79</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>3. The U.S. aircraft at no time approached closer than 53 nautical miles
                            from the Libyan coast and at the time it was intercepted by the Libyan
                            planes was 75 nautical miles off Libyan shores. The U.S. considers that
                            the American aircraft in question was exercising the freedom to fly over
                            the high seas in accordance with international law. The United States
                            does not consider that any nation may validly purport to subject any
                            part of the high seas, or the airspace over the high seas, to its
                            sovereignty, nor to establish prohibited areas of the kind referred to
                            in the Ministry’s note. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            considers that the aircraft of the Libyan Air Force that flew
                            dangerously close to the American aircraft failed to pay reasonable
                            regard to the interests of all states in the exercise of the freedom of
                            the high seas, in accordance with international law.<note n="5"

                            exception of South Yemen, where the U.S. has neither diplomatic
                            relations nor resident officials under the flag of a protecting power,
                            Libya and Iraq are the two Arab States whose interests and policies
                            radically diverge from our own. Iraq is the only Arab country which has
                            not resumed diplomatic relations broken off during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
                            War. Libya was one of the few Arab countries which did not sever
                            relations with us then; after <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s takeover in September 1969, however,
                            U.S.-Libyan relations deteriorated and since November 1972, our
                            respective Embassies have been headed by Chargés.</p>
                        <p>Iraq and Libya refuse to accept the existence of the State of Israel and
                            share support of the Palestinian elements that reject a negotiated
                            settlement. Although Iraq and Libya share much of the ideological
                            paraphernalia of the radical end of the Third World spectrum, Iraq’s
                            orientation is secular and modernizing while Libya’s is conservative
                            Islamic. Apparent similarities between Iraq and Libya probably are
                            outweighed by actual differences in ideology, political style and social
                            custom. The Soviet Union is the major supplier of military equipment to
                            Iraq and Libya but the single-party governments in both countries remain
                            deeply suspicious of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. In
                            Libya the Communist Party is outlawed; in Iraq it is severely
                            circumscribed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Libya</p>
                        <p>Under <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s leadership, Libya
                            adopted foreign and domestic policies characterized by extreme
                            nationalism, militant Islam, and advocacy of radical Third World
                            ideology. Between 1969 and 1974 the Libyans ejected us from Wheelus Air
                            Base, attacked an unarmed American C–130 plane in international
                            airspace, partially or totally nationalized U.S. oil interests in Libya,
                            expelled American missionaries <pb n="213" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_213"
                            />and confiscated their properties without compensation, and, during the
                            1973 Arab-Israel conflict, applied an embargo on the sale of petroleum
                            to the U.S. which lasted until 1975.</p>
                        <p>But the most important issue dividing us has been <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s commitment to the destruction
                            of Israel, his willingness to use Libyan resources to undermine a
                            negotiated Middle East settlement and subvert those Arab Governments
                            which favor such a solution, and his support for international
                            terrorism.</p>
                        <p>Despite our political problems with Libya, we maintain active commercial
                            relations; nearly 10 percent of our crude oil is imported from Libya,
                            representing about 30 percent of Libya’s production. Approximately 2,000
                            Americans live in Libya, working for oil companies and in other
                            occupations. About 2,000 Libyans are studying at U.S. institutions of
                            higher learning under Libyan Government sponsorship.</p>
                        <p>Since late 1974 the Libyans have professed a desire for improved
                            relations. Libya appears uneasy over its estrangement from fellow Arabs
                            and its growing reliance upon the Soviets for arms and technology. By
                            improving relations with the U.S. Libya may hope to lessen its
                            dependence on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, to obtain
                            access to U.S. military goods and technology and to regain status and
                            respectability in the Arab world. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> appears to believe that the advent of a new U.S.
                            Administration offers the possibility of a change for the better.</p>
                        <p>In our discussions with Libyan representatives we have indicated that a

                        <p>We maintain active commercial relations with both nations, and Libya has
                            recently indicated its interest in establishing normal diplomatic
                                relations.<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">In telegram 230 from Tripoli,

                                desire for improved relations with the United States, and presented
                                Libya’s positions on the two barriers to improvement: the Middle
                                East and terrorism. (Carter Library, National Security Affairs,

                            the economic and political activities of the Persian Gulf area and has
                            resolved, at least for the moment, the border dispute and the Kurdish
                            issue which had been a major source of irritation in its relations with
                            Iran.</p>
                        <p>In both cases, I believe that we should be alert for opportunities to
                            develop more normal relations. The timing, however, of any U.S.
                            unilateral move in this direction will be extremely important since it
                            will be interpreted by other Middle Eastern states as a signal of our
                            intentions and could have major implications for the success of our
                            efforts to promote an Arab-Israel settlement. Both Libya and Iraq are
                            viewed as pariahs by their neighbors. Thus, I would recommend that any
                            move on our part toward closer ties be carefully prepared in advance
                            through consultations with our friends in the area, particularly the

                            effective political instrument. It will also provide him with a pretext
                            for sidelining and perhaps abolishing completely the military’s
                            Revolutionary Command Council, which has theoretically ruled Libya since
                            1969.</p>

                            about the attitudes of the rest of the officer corps, which views the

                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s one-man rule. The
                            defection of other Council members in the wake of Muhayshi’s betrayal
                            and the resentment stirred up by an investigation of the conspiracy
                            compounded tensions between <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> and the military and ended all pretense of

                        <p>Since 1975, the incidence of insubordination and violence within the
                            armed forces—including at least several attempts on <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s life—has increased markedly.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has responded by
                            repositioning key units and major ammunition stores, by upgrading the
                            police and paramilitary forces at the expense of the army, and by
                            systematically replacing all those suspected of disloyalty with his
                            kinsmen and members of tribes from his home region.</p>
                        <p>He has been hesitant to reduce the power of his subordinates on the
                            Council, however, without first regaining control over the military. He
                            apparently now feels confident that he can remove the glaring evidence
                            of divided leadership that the Council has come to represent. None of
                            the four active members, including Prime Minister Jallud, has a
                            powerbase sufficiently strong to challenge <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, and dissension among them probably precludes
                            their acting in concert.</p>
                        <p>In his campaign to sell the new government structure, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has carefully skirted the
                            question of what will become of his colleagues. He has said only that
                            their “protective role” is over and that the people can seek their help
                            as they see fit. The Council could theoretically remain as part of the
                            military command or any of its members could relinquish his rank and
                            serve in the new all-civilian government. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> may favor such an arrangement as a way of
                            mitigating the ill-will he has already engendered in his colleagues.</p>

                            encouraging them to greater political activism. His orchestration of
                            numerous popular demonstrations has served both to generate enthusiasm
                            for the new order and to warn his detractors that he has the support to
                            carry off the change.</p>
                        <p>Stripped of its socialist jargon, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s blueprint, in theory, resembles that of a
                            parliamentary system. The electorate, however, is to be organized in
                            small neighborhood “congresses,” trade unions, and “people’s committees”
                            to give <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s tribal
                            supporters maximum representation. A national people’s congress, a
                            secretary general, and a cabinet are to serve as parliament, premier,
                            and government. The people’s congress is also supposed to elect a
                            president—presumably <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>—who
                            has vaguely defined but no doubt sweeping powers.</p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="0238" xml:id="pg_217"/>
                        <p>Much of what <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has said
                            about the new government and the way he has orchestrated its promotion
                            are reminiscent of old-fashioned tribal politics. Meetings over the past
                            several months to discuss the plan have consisted of debate over local
                            interests, with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> both
                            receiving and issuing criticism and advice but always acting as final
                            arbiter. Most of his audience seem to enjoy the exchange, and are
                            prepared to do his bidding.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Cynical View</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s decision to inaugurate
                            the new government in Sabhah—his small desert hometown where the Qadhafa
                            tribe is still centered—and to invite such notables as Fidel Castro was
                            calculated not only to attract international attention but to forestall
                            any effort to disrupt the proceedings. He is probably especially worried
                            about disgruntled officers who resent the termination of their special
                            role in the Libyan government.</p>
                        <p>According to several sources, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s move is regarded by much of the military as a
                            simple power play which will lead to further changes in the officer
                            corps and a general diminution of the importance of the armed forces.
                            Most officers concede that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> already completely controls what will become the
                            apparatus of the new government, and believe he will have little trouble
                            sidelining officers who are close to Prime Minister Jallud,
                            Commander-in-Chief Mustafa Kharubi, and the other two remaining Council
                            members.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear that this cynicism extends to the rank and file. Most
                            enlisted men come from Bedouin families whose lot has improved markedly
                            under <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s rule. Moreover,
                            as <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has moved against
                            officers, he has been careful to cultivate their subordinates. In
                            addition to keeping the salaries of the enlisted men relatively high,
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has repeatedly
                            admonished officers to follow the example of the “loyal” rank and
                            file.</p>
                        <p>Libya’s small educated middle class probably views with alarm the
                            changeover in government. The traditional commercial establishment and
                            the new class of professionals and businessmen have never been
                            sympathetic to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s military
                            dictatorship. Now they are even more fearful of his turn toward tribal
                            politics.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has coupled his elevation
                            of tribal groups with repeated verbal attacks on the urban “bourgeoisie”
                            and a number of policy moves against the private sector of the economy.
                            So far, the business community has been able to fight a successful
                            rear-guard action by simply delaying, ignoring, or evading his decrees.
                            This may become increasingly difficult, however, as tribal and rural
                            leaders—who have a strong bias against the urban establishment—become
                            more politicized.</p>

                            Ambassadors is agreed upon. Al-Mismari will then have the primary job of
                            improving short-term relations with the United States. In the event that

                        <p>In late summer 1981, multiple intelligence reports from a variety of
                            sources revealed Libyan Chairman <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Mu’ammar
                                Qadhafi</persName>’s intentions to assassinate U.S. citizens,
                            including President Ronald Reagan. In telegram 79388 to multiple
                            recipients, November 21, 1981, the Central Intelligence Agency provided
                            an analysis of the attempt against Ambassador to Egypt <persName
                                corresp="#p_EHF_1">Hermann Eilts</persName> to provide background
                            for <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s current threats.
                            According to this analysis, the plot to assassinate <persName
                                corresp="#p_EHF_1">Eilts</persName> was formed in 1976, in reaction
                            to the disengagement agreements between Egypt and Israel. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> viewed these agreements as a
                            form of treason and blamed the effort on the United States. According to
                            the Agency: “Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EHF_1">Eilts</persName>
                            had been picked as the target of the operation because he was considered
                            to be the major U.S. representative of the ‛imperialist-reactionary’
                            policy of U.S.-Egyptian collusion.”</p>
                        <p>The plan, developed by Venezualan terrorist Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez
                            (“Carlos the Jackal”) and the Libyan intelligence service, involved the
                            use of two hit men documented as Egyptians. The first plan involved
                            planting an incendiary device “somewhere within the U.S. Embassy in
                            Cairo.” That plan was subsequently abandoned in favor of “a small,
                            well-trained team to carry out a direct personal attack on the
                            Ambassador.”</p>
                        <p>“Execution of the operation involved two separate but related actions.
                            First, a sniper, probably using a Soviet M–54 sniper rifle, would fire
                            at the Ambassador as he exited the front door of the Embassy. The second
                            member of the team would then throw grenades to anyone attempting to
                            come to the Ambassador’s assistance. Should a sniper attack be
                            impossible because of trees or other obstacles in the line of fire, then
                            the main attack would be made on the Ambassador’s car as it exited the
                            Embassy grounds. In this case, since ‛Carlos’ believed that the car
                            would be armor-plated and would have bullet-proof glass, one attacker
                            would throw Soviet-made high-explosive grenades underneath the car in
                            order to force the occupants to leave the vehicle. The Ambassador would
                            then be shot with a handgun. The other team member, with his sniper
                            rifle, would be stationed in a building across the street from the
                            Embassy where he could fire on anyone attempting to aid the Ambassador
                            and also try to cover his partner’s retreat.”</p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="0242" xml:id="pg_221"/>
                        <p>The plan was cancelled when surveillance revealed that security around
                            both the Ambassador and the Embassy had been strengthened. Additionally,
                            before the “action agents” departed for Cairo, Libya received a démarche
                            from the United States, informing <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> of U.S. knowledge of the plot, and demanding
                            that it be aborted. No attempt was made against <persName

                        <p>1. Below is an informal translation (by Embassy Arabic-trained officers)
                            of note handed me at noon April 14 by <gloss target="#t_FonOff_1"
                                >FonOff</gloss> Americas Dept official Ibrahim Bahad under direct
                            instructions from ForSec Turayki. Arabic text will be pouched.</p>
                        <p>2. Bahad said delay in response was due to need for investigation into
                            matter by Libyan Government. Investigation, he added, was continuing.
                            After hearing his sketchy account of contents, I asked why Col.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had not taken
                            opportunity for direct communication with President <persName

                            for Colonel’s methods but note constituted considered views of Libyan
                            Government and hinted that Colonel had hand in drafting.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to my query, Sahad said he had not seen text President’s
                            letter and didn’t know if Turayki had.<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">An

                                    <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s letter was not
                                found.</note> He believed he and Turayki only two officials in
                            Tripoli <gloss target="#t_FonOff_1">FonOff</gloss> aware of subject;
                            added that matter very sensitive for Libyan Government which appreciated
                            thus far discreet handling by U.S. He reiterated continuing Libyan
                            desire improve political relations with new administration and regretted
                            ongoing unfriendly U.S. attitude more in sorrow than anger. He <pb

                            misunderstanding might not have arisen. He concluded brief presentation
                            by reiterating statement made to me early March in Sebha by FonSec
                            Turayki that U.S. would be best advised not to take sides in disputes
                            between Arab countries.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Carle reported on his

                        <p>4. Unsurprisingly Libyans sticking to Qashut’s initial denial but in more
                            detail and seeking pin blame on Egypt. Content of note appears to be one
                            long prevarication while tone is conciliatory.</p>
                        <p>5. There are probably a variety of reasons for indirect response through
                            Embassy rather than direct answer from Colonel. High on list is Libyan
                            pride and pique that Charge Qashut’s initial retort was not
                                accepted.<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">See <ref target="#d86">Document

                            affair and characterize it as a “misunderstanding.” Even though

                            Nevertheless, he probably chose to toss it back to <gloss

                            doubt he really feels.</p>

                        <p>The Secretariat wishes to clarify two points contained in the
                            above-mentioned note. In the first instance, the names of the persons
                            (men) are non-Libyan, as the numbers of their passports and dates of
                            their births in that note (of that date) exchanged on this subject.
                            Despite our conviction that the subject in its entirety does not warrant
                            the sending of messages, nevertheless we respond in order not to destroy
                            a dialogue even on this subject.</p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="0244" xml:id="pg_223"/>
                        <p>Secondly, the aforementioned note names some officers and the American
                            Ambassador to Egypt who was the subject of the note. It is very clear
                            that this information is false Egyptian information.</p>
                        <p>Before responding to this note, we gathered the facts about the first
                            point and began an investigation of the aspects of the note as soon as
                            it was brought to our attention.</p>
                        <p>The two officers mentioned were referred to in a message broadcast by the
                            Egyptian Middle East Radio (MENA) for reasons of their own. This
                            information that appears in the note is the work of Egyptian Middle East
                            News Broadcast (MENA). We wish to make it clear that the officers do not
                            work in Libyan intelligence but work in the field of agriculture since
                            the beginning of the revolution and everyone knows them and knows the
                            agricultural projects which they are known for. No doubt the American
                            companies working in the area know that as well.</p>
                        <p>We undertook a careful investigation of the two persons mentioned in the
                            message and it appears that the first is Azzat Mahmud Abdel Rahman of
                            Egyptian nationality who entered the country more than four years ago as
                            a construction worker (carpenter for reinforced cement) and the
                            investigation continues to learn more information about him. As for the
                            second person, he is Nasir Iddiin Jaffar. He is of Sudanese nationality
                            and entered the country for work with a contractor. He is now working
                            (as a houseboy) in the Brazilian Embassy in Libya. We are absolutely
                            convinced that no Libyan party previously contacted or commissioned him
                            with any act, but we do not know if this Sudanese is an agent of foreign
                            intelligence and we do not know if he is involved in spreading rumors.
                            We invite you to meet with him; the meeting can be attended by an
                            American and a Libyan party, and we have no objection to a third,
                            neutral party in order to assure you that your information is false and
                            has no foundation in fact.</p>
                        <p>The very choice of the American Ambassador in Cairo shows that the entire
                            subject is an Egyptian plot against Libya. Otherwise, why not an
                            American diplomat working in Libya or in any other country. We return to
                            the theme that Egyptian intelligence aims at involving the United States
                            of America in a local dispute.</p>
                        <p>The Carlos mentioned in the message has only been mentioned by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>. We again must clarify that
                            Carlos has not entered Libya except on the occasion of the Oil
                            Minister’s kidnapping when he transitted Tripoli International Airport
                            after the plane had stopped at other international airports. Since that
                            time we don’t know anything about Carlos. We inform you that Carlos is
                            wanted by us for trial because he killed one of the members of the
                            official Libyan delegation at the <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>
                            Ministers’ Conference in Vienna.</p>
                        <p>We inform the United States of America that we are not killers nor
                            bandits and we are principled.</p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="0245" xml:id="pg_224"/>
                        <p>If we decided on a belligerent course, we would announce this and it
                            would be because the world would be convinced of the justification for
                            it, or we ourselves would be convinced, and if we do not decide on war
                            openly, there is no other way for us.</p>
                        <p>We took the first steps to encourage President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and we announced our faith in
                            the new American administration because President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> is a man of religious principle
                            and morality. It is not reasonable that we would encourage the new
                            administration by undertaking acts which would ruin relations with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is not possible that we could be responsible for the
                            brutality which is attributed to us. We know that we are a neutral,
                            progressive revolution with friends and enemies. The enemies will plot
                            our downfall if we are not prepared to counter whatever the enemy may
                            conspire against us. Because of this, we work for ourselves and carry
                            the burden with courage.</p>

                        <p>1. At his request, Libyan Charge <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1"
                                >Gashut</persName> called on Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName

                            relations with his Foreign Minister. <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1"
                                >Gashut</persName> initiated conversation by stating that he wished
                            to discuss Department Spokesman’s comments of June 10 to effect <gloss

                                >Gashut</persName> asked rhetorical question, “What can we do,” then
                            proceeded to answer it by stating Libya was prepared to send Ambassador;
                            he added that U.S. should release C–130’s.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> noted in reply that it
                            would be best to discuss major substantive policies at issue between us,
                            than to focus on possible misinterpretation of Department’s Press
                            Spokesman’s remarks. He then reviewed in detail administration’s Middle
                            East policy, with its purpose the establishment of a permanent, just
                            peace for all in the area, including <pb n="226" facs="0247"
                                xml:id="pg_226"/>the Palestinians. He noted that the logic of
                            Libya’s rejectionist posture was the frustration of this major policy
                            initiative of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            and the condemnation of the area to future wars.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> continued that Libya’s
                            support for rejectionist organizations as a part of its Middle East
                            policy resulted in Libyan support for terrorist actions. We did not want
                            to get into a sterile argument of definitions, i.e., terrorist vs.
                            freedom fighters. No matter what one called the persons involved, the
                            massacre of innocent people, such as the Rome airport tragedy, was an
                            abominable act which had to be condemned by all.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d90fn2">Reference is presumably to the December 17, 1973,

                            important to recognize that we were not dealing in semantics, but

                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName>, with force and some
                            emotion, replied by defending his government’s Middle East policy. He
                            argued that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was not
                            trying to stop the convening of a Geneva Conference but he did not
                            believe that this conference could result in justice for the
                            Palestinians. The thrust of his presentation was that Libya could not do
                            other than support the rejectionist cause if it were to remain true to
                            its own revolutionary traditions. He explained that Libya’s solution to
                            the problem was the creation of a secular democratic state in Palestine.
                            As concerns the Israelis, he explained that his government believed that
                            all Jews who were in Palestine prior to 1947 should be allowed to remain
                            and coexist peacefully with the Arabs in this secular democratic state.
                            All of the others would have to leave. He subsumed the “terrorist issue”
                            in his presentation.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> noted that successive
                            American administrations had expressed the commitment of this country to
                            the security and existence of the state of Israel. This was a given in
                            American policy which has been accepted by the Arab confrontation
                            states, who were cooperating with us in our search for peace in the
                            Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName> responded by
                            describing the Libyan view of the “Arab nation” which, to the extent we
                            could understand his point, seemed to imply that those particular Arab
                            states we referred to were really irrelevant to the current situation
                            and to the great sweep of history.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName> returned to the need
                            for both countries to engage in actions to improve relations. He backed
                            into an endorsement of a “high level dialogue” by explaining the
                            necessity for senior officials to sit and reason together, putting aside
                            the issues which may divide us and concentrating on the areas of
                            agreement. To support his contention of wide areas of agreement between
                            us, he cited the fact that Libya and <pb n="227" facs="0248"
                                xml:id="pg_227"/>the United States had voted together on “great
                            numbers” of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions.</p>
                        <p>7. Conversation then turned to subject of Libya’s relations with other
                            Arab states. <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> noted that,
                            as far as U.S. was concerned, basically this was something for Libya and
                            the other Arab states concerned to sort out. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName> brightened up at this point and
                            said, “thank you, that’s good to hear.” <persName corresp="#p_VN_1"
                                >Veliotes</persName> then noted that we had, however, legitimate
                            concerns about certain aspects of Libya’s relations with other Arab
                            states, particularly when Libyan policies and actions were aimed at
                            certain Arab governments and leaders who were very friendly to us and
                            were cooperating with us in our search for peace in the Middle East. We
                            could only conclude that a principal purpose—if not the principal
                            purpose—of such Libyan policies was the disruption of our Middle East
                            peace policy. Although these were intra-Arab problems to be solved by
                            the Arab parties concerned, Libya should be aware of our interpretation
                            of its purposes as they affect us.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> then noted that,
                            looked at in light of foregoing discussion, questions of exchange of
                            Ambassadors and release of C–130’s were symptoms of a problem, not the
                            cause. He added that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>’s Middle East policy, the success of which was
                            very important for global as well as regional considerations, was
                            offering peace with justice to all concerned. In striking contrast,
                            based on <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName>’s description,
                            the logic of Libyan policy was to offer to Palestinians and others the
                            “peace of the grave.” <persName corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName>
                            protested this conclusion and repeated his earlier comments about the
                            need for Libya to be true to its revolutionary traditions.</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: Our conversation lasted for about an hour and was always
                            cordial, if frank and vigorous. Upon leaving, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSF_1">Gashut</persName> said he would look forward to
                            another discussion after his return from Libya in August. Based on this
                            experience, we conclude that no useful purpose can be served by
                            initiating a “higher level dialogue” in near future.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Oshkosh Truck Company has a contract to sell $60 million worth of
                            large trucks to Libya. These trucks are purely commercial items and are
                            not controlled by any policy prohibitions. However, they are extremely
                            large and are intended for the Libyan Army as end user. It is evident to
                            everyone that the Libyans intend to use them as tank transporters. State
                            originally took a very firm position with Commerce, insisting that this
                            sale be placed under a controlled list where it could be affected by
                            policy considerations. Commerce has stalled. Yesterday, the Oshkosh
                            Company, which faces severe financial hardship if the sale is killed,
                            managed to convince <persName corresp="#p_CRN_1">Cooper</persName> at
                            State that the sale should go through. <persName corresp="#p_CRN_1"
                                >Cooper</persName> has reportedly convinced <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> to reverse the previous
                            State position. We are informed that the first trucks are due to be
                            shipped at the end of this week. (C)</p>
                        <p>If this sale is approved, we face three policy repercussions:</p>
                        <p>—We must be prepared to answer queries on the Hill during a time when
                            terrorist legislation is under active consideration;</p>
                        <p>—We must reexamine our own policy since we recently turned down the sale
                            of 727s to Libya on the grounds they could be used for military
                            purposes, and this is in direct contradiction.</p>
                        <p>—We must consider how to inform <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"

                        <p>David’s earlier call to State was successful in preventing a total

                            for use as tank transporters. However, it was not successful—at least
                            thus far—in getting State officially back to its previous position of
                            lobbying with Commerce to get the trucks placed on a validated list
                            rather than the general license it is now on. A validated listing
                            permits us to exercise policy control over sales. A general license is

                        <p>The issue will go to Under Secretary Harmon at Commerce within 24 hours.
                            Once he has made a decision, it will be extremely difficult to reverse
                            it. As far as I can tell, State does not plan to weigh in on this,
                            although they are still trying to develop a collective position. I
                            believe it is essential that Commerce be aware of the foreign policy
                            implications of this case and that they be informed in advance of our
                            concern. I have previously talked to <persName corresp="#p_MSJ_1">Stan

                        <p>1. Department is following closely reports of your initial meetings with
                            Libyan officials and is pleased to learn of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s alleged interest in better relations with U.S.
                            However, Department recalls that in recent past similar professions by
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> have been accompanied
                            by actions and public accusations incompatible with any improvement in
                            bilateral relations. There does not appear to be any novel element in
                            the current situation, e.g. persuasive evidence of serious strain in
                            Libyan-Soviet relations, which might be prompting <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to consider the changes in
                            Libyan policy which his emissaries have been informed would be necessary
                            for more normal relations with U.S. There also are other foreign and
                            domestic policy reasons which argue against modification of our current
                            policy of indicating our displeasure with Libyan behavior by refusing to
                            discourse with them at a senior level.</p>
                        <p>2. Department does appreciate and share your desire to work, where
                            possible, for an improvement in bilateral relations. Department has
                            informed Madfa’i it is prepared to resume the discussions initiated
                            before his departure on consultations. Department is pleased action is

                            Department will continue to monitor closely Libya’s behavior regarding
                            terrorism, its neighbors, and Middle East peace process, while
                            indicating to Libyan officials that these are areas where more
                            responsible action on their government’s part offers the possibility for
                            more normal bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>3. You should inform the GOL immediately, and we will inform Madfa’i,
                            that the Department has decided to consult with Congress on its attitude
                            toward the sale of two 727s. Sale would be subject to obtaining
                            guarantee that aircraft would not be used other than for normal
                            commercial purposes and would only be made with clear understanding that
                            supply of spare parts for all LAA’s 727s could be cut off if any of
                            these aircraft were used for other than commercial purposes.<note n="3"

                            on Libyan PermRep Kikhia at <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> request for one hour Oct 2. After short
                            discussion of Camp David Accords, during which Kikhia made standard plea
                            for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> to recognize <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> switched conversation to bilateral relations. He
                            said he was prepared to see if some improvement is possible. Private
                            links continue to prosper through companies, unofficial trips, and the

                            administration going to Congress to try to get consensus on proceeding
                            with the sale of commercial aircraft to Libya. Agreement has been given
                            for the export of the 400 Oshkosh trucks. Dept has noted with pleasure
                            that Libya has ratified The Hague Convention.<note n="4" xml:id="d95fn4"

                            With regard to C–130s, because of Libya’s active support for “terrorist”
                            activities, we are not able to move on military items.</p>
                        <p>2. Kikhia expressed his great personal interest in improving relations.
                            On positive side, he cited existence of diplomatic relations, fact that
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> imports approx. 40 percent of
                            Libyan oil at annual cost of 4 billion dollars, 4,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> citizens working in Libya, and 3,000
                            Libyan students in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. What bothers
                            him is that every American official gives him a different reason for the
                            lack of high level official relations. Some have said because of support
                            for <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and Pentagon has put Libya in
                            category of nations “dangerous to U.S.” which makes no sense. Libyan
                            policies were almost identical to those of Algeria and Iraq and there is
                            no such campaign against them. Stories such as threat to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Amb in Cairo and its connection with
                            Moro revolt have been incorrect <pb n="234" facs="0255" xml:id="pg_234"
                            />or exaggerated.<note n="5" xml:id="d95fn5">An unknown hand underlined

                            he alleged <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had put out statements
                            suggesting Libya is seeking to improve relations, under pressure from
                            U.S. This puts Libya in a “humiliating” position. Kikhia concluding that
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> needs a scapegoat in the region
                            for domestic political reasons and Libya serves the purpose.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said we are dealing
                            with public impressions and it is not useful to argue about allegations
                            of Libyan involvement in acts against <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            interests—that is what is believed in the public and in the Congress.
                            His call was “informal” to find out Libyan desires. He understood they
                            include exchange of Ambassadors, beginning of high-level dialogue, and
                            more normal diplomatic exchanges. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> said he will examine these ideas. He could then
                            meet again with Kikhia or FM Turayki to try to clear away some of the
                            misunderstandings. Department sees desirability of better relations, but
                            we must justify each step we take in view of prevailing impressions of
                            Libyan policies.</p>
                        <p>4. In closing, Kikhia raised possibility of following such future meeting
                            with a joint communique in which each side would state its position.
                            This would be preferable to unilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> statement which suggests Libya responding to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> pressure.</p>
                        <p>5. Department has been taking look at Libyan-<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> relations and will give further attention in light this
                            conversation. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> will plan
                            contact Kikhia again when Under Secretary returns from Europe Oct

                                >Newsom</persName>’s Meeting With Libyan Foreign Secretary
                            Turayki.</p>
                        <p>1. Summary. Luncheon meeting focused primarily on bilateral relations.
                            Issue of a joint statement on terrorism, which earlier had been
                            discussed informally as a possible precondition for movement toward
                            normalization of relations, did not arise, as each side restated
                            familiar positions on terrorism. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> told Turayki frankly that Libya’s image with
                            Congress and public as supporter of terrorists and meddler in affairs of
                            other nations would have to improve before political relations could
                            become more normal. Turayki reiterated desire for better relations
                            without holding out any promise that Libya would change its policies to
                            facilitate this process. Exchanges on Middle East and Africa broke
                            little new ground. Despite sharp disagreements, meeting was cordial.
                            Discussion on Western Sahara reported <gloss target="#t_septel_1"

                                Tripoli, October 21, summarized the discussion on the Western
                                Sahara: “Turayki said Libya feels Morocco and Mauritania must comply
                                with the resolutions of the UNGA and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                    >OAU</gloss> and that the consultation conducted with the Jemaa
                                did not do this. Libya had tried to facilitate negotiations between
                                the Moroccans and Algerians but without success.” (National

                        <p>2. Meeting was held as a result of an earlier discussion between
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> and Libyan PermRep
                                <persName corresp="#p_KM_1">Kikhya</persName>.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d96fn3">See <ref target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note> At
                            the request of the Libyans, who were fearful that press would describe
                            them as coming cap in hand to Washington to seek an improvement in
                            relations, no public announcement was made of the meeting. In response
                            to Libyans’ request for an informal exchange, meeting was conducted over
                            lunch, and <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> spent almost
                            two hours with Turayki, who was accompanied by Charge Madfa’i and a
                            notetaker from the Embassy. Although there had been previous discussion
                            with the Libyans about the possibility that a joint statement on
                            terrorism might be published as a step toward more normal bilateral
                            political relations, it quickly became apparent this was not in the
                            cards, and the subject was not raised.</p>

                        <p>3. Discussion opened rather slowly with an exchange on Southern Africa
                            focused largely on press accounts. When <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> asked about Libya’s relations with Chad, Turayki
                            said problems remain but his government is in touch with the Sudanese
                            and Nigerians. After more rather general remarks about South Asia and
                            the state of King Khalid’s health, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> engaged Turayki on bilateral relations by
                            commenting that recent Arab-American Dialogue in Tripoli served a
                            particularly useful function, given the limits on what could be
                            accomplished on a government to government basis. Elaborating, he
                            explained that Libya’s image with the Congress as a supporter of
                            terrorist groups inevitably puts restrictions on what the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Government will do vis a vis Libya.</p>
                        <p>4. Turayki responded that his government wanted “at least” normal
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and felt the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> emphasis on terrorism was an
                            attempt to make Libya a scapegoat for its Middle East policies. When he
                            suggested distinction between terrorists and liberation fighters,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that impression
                            exists in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> that Libya supplies funds
                            and arms to groups which engage for whatever motive in acts which result
                            in loss of innocent lives. Moreover, Libyans, or individuals trained in
                            Libya, had been involved in incidents such as those at Orly and Istanbul
                            airports, and in the assassination of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            diplomats, which had no direct relation with the attainment of national
                            liberation. Turayki responded that some liberation fighters trained in
                            Libya might misuse their training, but Americans trained by <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Army sometimes use their military skills
                            to commit crimes. Libya is not responsible for everything done by those
                            trained in Libya and agrees that some of these activities are not
                            related to liberation and deserve condemnation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> replied that while <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> realizes and has informed interested
                            members of the Congress that Libya has acceded to the international
                            conventions on hijacking, he did not remember Libya ever having
                            condemned a terrorist attack at an airport.</p>
                        <p>5. Shifting ground, Turayki said that while his government is interested
                            in dialogue with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, it would not
                            respond to pressure. He characterized <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            decisions on trucks and planes as pressure, stating these decisions had

                            Turayki then repeated argument that real basis for <gloss

                            disagreement on Middle East policy and threatened that Libya would buy
                            admittedly inferior aircraft from alternate sources. Without using term
                            Soviets, he suggested Libya would move closer to them “if backed into a
                            corner” by <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. <persName

                            said hand of Libya seen in many acts of violence which do not seem
                            related to the Arab cause, mentioning the Philippines, and talk of
                            Libyan involvement in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. The
                            impression that Libya is prepared to support acts of violence against
                            governments all over the world makes it difficult to improve bilateral
                            relations. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> realizes Libya can
                            purchase aircraft elsewhere, he concluded, but discussion was based on
                            Libya’s desire for American planes.</p>
                        <p>7. When <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> asked for
                            clarification of Libya’s general policy regarding the supply of arms to
                            dissident groups, Turayki replied he had come to discuss bilateral
                            relations not Libyan policy. He accused <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> of supporting terrorism by furnishing Israel with
                            weapons. At this point <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                            commented that he had read Turayki’s General Assembly address, and,
                            returning to this subject a few minutes later, said Turayki’s
                            characterization of American policy represented rhetoric ten years out
                            of date.<note n="5" xml:id="d96fn5">Turayki addressed the General

                        <p>8. When discussion again focused on bilateral relations, <persName

                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> diplomat, would have access to Turayki
                            and other Libyan officials. Administration recognizes there have been
                            positive developments, such as accession to hijacking conventions and
                            settlement of nationalization cases. Congress is kept informed of these
                            matters, and the administration would keep in mind <pb n="238"
                                facs="0259" xml:id="pg_238"/>the possibility of normalizing
                            relations. When Turayki objected that trade restrictions would be an
                            impediment to this process, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> reminded him that Libya’s image in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> also is an obstacle.</p>
                        <p>9. Raising the Camp David Accords, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> stressed importance <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> attaches to implementation of both agreements,
                            emphasizing benefits for Palestinians. Turayki responded that all Arabs
                            except <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> oppose the Accords
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> had signed them when
                            his position was weak. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is
                            within his rights signing a Sinai agreement, Turayki said, but he has no
                            right to be discussing Palestinian problems. If <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> wants a real and permanent peace it should reconsider
                            its position regarding <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>10. Rejecting Turayki’s description of Arab reaction to the Camp David
                            Accords, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said he saw no
                            realistic alternative which would allow Palestinians to regain homeland.
                            When Turayki suggested <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> put more
                            pressure on Israel, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                            commented that as proud and independent state Libya could understand how
                            Israelis would resent pressure. He pointed out that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> had put unprecedented pressure
                            on Israel already. Any contact with <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>
                            would provoke a congressional prohibition on such meetings. By accepting
                            responsibility for violent acts not directly related to the Palestinian
                            struggle, <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and Fatah have earned a
                            poor image in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. Turayki countered that
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has a bad image among people of
                            Arab world. While America might have good relations with leaders of weak
                            reactionary regimes, the Arab people do not accept American professions
                            of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>11. Despite evident differences, meeting ended cordially, with Turayki
                            suggesting that <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> or
                            Secretary visit Tripoli. It was agreed that should there be any press
                            inquiries about the meeting each side would state that it had been
                            arranged to take advantage of Turayki’s presence in the <gloss

                        <p>You should be aware that Clinton Murchison—among other things owner of
                            the Dallas Cowboys—is soon on his way to Libya to discuss an air defense
                            system. (State opposed sale of this system to Libya, but Murchison
                            evidently formed a company in the Bahamas and designed the system with
                            European parts to avoid the restrictions.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CWA_1">Billy Carter</persName> was Murchison’s
                            guest at the Super Bowl, and another guest was Irving Davidson who is
                            Murchison’s advance and PR man. Davidson is a Vice President of one of
                            Murchison’s businesses and, among other things, is a registered agent

                        <p>During the game, Libya was much discussed. Davidson described the process
                            of registering as a foreign agent as a painless one that is merely a

                        <p>Commerce opened the issue of selling Boeing 727s to Libya in May 1978. In
                            August 1978 <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> agreed that
                            serious consideration go forward. The <gloss target="#t_NEA_1"
                                >NEA</gloss> Bureau sent <persName corresp="#p_MSJ_1">Stanley
                                Marcuss</persName>, Commerce, a memorandum on November 2 which
                            approved the sale because Libya had provided assurances that the 727s
                            would only be used for civil aviation.<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">Not

                            Libya was warned, all spare parts for 727s would be cut off. Although I
                            cannot get to complete State files this morning, all the information
                            available indicates that <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                            approved this final action. (C)</p>
                        <p>The considerations behind the approval were twofold. On the one hand,
                            Boeing and Commerce made a strong case that the effect on our foreign
                            trade deficit would be significant, not small change. On the other hand,
                            State came to the view that we might turn Libya around on its terrorism
                            policy. Recently, after Libya agreed to support certain international
                            anti-hijacking agreements, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_QACE_1"
                                >Quainton</persName> visited Tripoli for discussions with the Libyan
                            Foreign Minister.<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3">In telegram 33222 to Tunis,

                            productive as expected, but Libya did not draw back in its softer
                            rhetoric. (S)</p>
                        <p>During all this diplomatic effort, of course, Libya has been quite busy
                            in training terrorists and acting as a supply and transit depot for
                            covert activities throughout the region. (S)</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s support for Amin is

                            prompted numerous press and Congressional inquiries. The state of our
                            current knowledge is sufficiently imperfect that we can honestly reply
                            that we have few details. But the Libyans have done themselves
                            substantial damage, creating further opposition to their normalization
                            campaign. When we are in the bubble at Tripoli remind me to tell you an

                            continue to deliver Chinooks to Libya (the Moroccans have been calling
                            attention to these deliveries when complaining about our initial refusal
                            to permit the Italians to ship Chinooks to Rabat). He called personally
                            and was quite concerned. I told him our lawyers say we could not
                            withdraw our permission (we looked into this when we learned the Libyans
                            are training Palestinian pilots on the choppers). On further reflection,

                                some noteworthy changes in Libyan activities, which at least
                                temporarily redound to the benefit of Western industrial states.

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has taken a number of
                            steps to improve his image in the West in general and Europe in
                            particular. No Palestinian or other Arab terrorist activities carried
                            out in Europe during 1978 can be attributed directly to the Libyans.
                            Tripoli, for example, had only a tangential connection with the May 1978
                            incident at Orly Airport in which members of the Popular Front for the
                            Liberation of Palestine (<gloss target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss>) fired
                            on passengers of an El Al airliner with weapons purchased by Libya in
                            1975; there is no evidence that the Libyans had prior knowledge of or
                            gave approval to the operation. [<hi rend="italic">classification

                        <p>3. The West Germans have particularly good reasons to welcome the change
                            in Libyan attitude. Before 1978, Libya maintained at least indirect ties
                            with German terrorists: groups such as the Baader-Meinhof <pb n="244"
                                facs="0265" xml:id="pg_244"/>Gang (BMG) and the Revolutionary Cells
                            (RZ) were involved in several joint terrorist attacks with the <gloss
                                target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss>, which has received substantial
                            Libyan aid. In one past incident, for example, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss> group that hijacked an Air France
                            jet in June 1976 included RZ members. On its way to Entebbe, Uganda, the
                            plane received permission to refuel at Benghazi, a move that the Libyans
                            later called a “humanitarian gesture”. [<hi rend="italic">classification

                        <p>4. In September 1977, however, the Libyans agreed to West German requests
                            not to grant asylum to members of the BMG whose release had been
                            demanded by the kidnappers of Dr. Schleyer. The next month they refused
                            landing permission to a hijacked Lufthansa jetliner; the <gloss
                                target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss> hijackers in this instance had been
                            aided by the BMG. A year later Libyan officials said they were ready to
                            cooperate with West German officials in locating four German terrorists
                            who had been expelled by Yugoslavia. The Libyans described the
                            terrorists as “disturbed persons” and promised that Libya would not only
                            deny them sanctuary but would try to persuade other countries to act
                            likewise. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and handling

                        <p>5. Italy also received some reassurances from Libya in 1978. Italian
                            security officials long suspected that the two major leftist terrorist
                            organizations, the Red Brigades (RB) and the Front Line, were benefiting
                            from external support, possibly including Libya. In what was probably a
                            public relations gesture, however, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> called in the Italian Ambassador a few weeks
                            after Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the RB in March 1978, to express his
                            condolences to Moro’s family, his condemnation of RB, and his
                            willingness to help in securing Moro’s release. However, Libya recently
                            purchased <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> diving equipment ($700,000
                            in June 1978 with a commitment to buy more in the future), and an
                            Italian claimed that he accidently witnessed the under water training of
                            RB members at a facility outside Tripoli. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>6. Libya has significantly reduced its material assistance to Irish
                            terrorist groups. As of 1978 the Libyans were no longer providing
                            weapons, support facilities, or training for the Irish Republican Army
                            (IRA). They were continuing to provide unspecified cash payments to the
                            IRA, despite new objections by some ranking Libyan officials that aid to
                            Irish terrorists furthers no Libyan or Arab goals. The <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> now seems to be the main Middle
                            Eastern donor of training and arms to the IRA. In 1978 Iraq decided for
                            the first time to extend military aid as well. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >classification marking and handling restriction not

                        <p>7. Libyan support for and training of Spanish and Basque terrorists
                            appears to have diminished. As late as 1976–77 a few persons affiliated
                            with Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA–V) and First of October
                            Revolutionary Group were reportedly trained in Algeria with some <pb
                                n="245" facs="0266" xml:id="pg_245"/>funding provided by Libya.
                            Moreover ETA–V may have received some weapons and ammunition through
                            Libyan [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]

                            during this period. At present, however, nearly all material support for
                            terrorism in Spain apparently comes from either indigenous sources or
                            ethnic Basques [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        <p>8. Libyan meddling in Greek and Turkish issues has remained limited and
                            to some degree works at cross-purposes. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not
                                declassified</hi>] Libya’s verbal endorsement of Kurdish
                            separatism—including the Turkish Kurds—is somewhat at odds with recent
                            Libyan-Turkish negotiations for military cooperation. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>9. In an unprecedented gesture, the Libyan Government last November
                            invited the Director of the Office for Combatting Terrorism of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Department of State to visit
                            Tripoli for discussions on international terrorism. When the visit took
                            place in January 1979 the Libyan Foreign Secretary put his government on
                            record concerning terrorism by noting that there were different
                            interpretations concerning the “legitimacy” of “liberation movements,”
                            with some having political claims that Libya supported.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d100fn3">See <ref target="#d98fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    98</ref>.</note> He added, however, that Libya opposed such acts
                            as hijacking and terrorism and advised its friends not to use means that
                            worked against their interests. He emphasized that the Palestinians do
                            not feel the same responsibility to the international community as do
                            the United States and Libya. He said Libya did not believe that
                            hijacking planes and individual crimes were helpful to the Palestinian
                            cause. Denying that Libya controlled such organizations, he added that
                            his country was ready to cooperate with the international community to
                            put an end to terrorist acts, and would advise “liberation movements” on
                            the “correct way to fight.” [<hi rend="italic">classification marking

                        <p>10. Such Libyan statements are to some degree self-serving. This was
                            highlighted by the Foreign Secretary’s comment that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy on embargoing certain items to
                            Libya was “not useful.” Moreover, while the Foreign Secretary can make
                            such policy statements, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            still makes the decisions, usually on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                            basis and without much regard for consistency. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >classification marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>11. Libya’s moves in recent years with regard to hijacking still reflect
                            some of this inconsistency, although its overall record is clearly <pb

                            with West German terrorists has been mentioned. In addition, Libya in
                            February 1978, refused landing permission to a Cypriot airliner that had
                            been commandeered by members of the Iraqi-supported Black June
                            Organization involved in the assassination of an Egyptian newspaper
                            editor. That refusal is consistent with the Libyan Foreign Secretary’s
                            statement to the visiting <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> official
                            last January that Libya would not support every act of violence carried

                        <p>12. On the negative side of the ledger, the Libyans have thus far refused
                            to support the antihijacking agreement reached at the July 1978 Economic
                            Summit in Bonn,<note n="8" xml:id="d100fn8">See <hi rend="italic">Public

                            permission to land. The Libyans released the passengers but ignored a

                            Convention which Tripoli ultimately supported. Nonetheless, in recent
                            months the Libyans have helped free: an American missionary who had been

                            fishing boat seized by the Polisario Front; several European hostages

                            The body called Israel is a racist, colonial and political phenomenon
                            that emerged from the Second World War, exactly like Rhodesia, and the
                            racist and colonial aspects of it make it impossible for us to recognize

                            international terrorist activities, Libya remains a major supporter of
                            Palestinian and other “national liberation” groups. While most of these

                            the Libyans put up $10 million for the December 1975 <gloss

                        <p>18. In another area of support for the Palestinians—training—Libya’s
                            profile is lower, although the type and perhaps the extent of the aid
                            probably remains unchanged. There are fewer Libyan facilities now
                            training Palestinians than before; of the 12 terrorist training camps in
                            Libya, at least four are used by Palestinian groups, compared to 20
                            camps operating in 1970. The overall level of Palestinian training has
                            not diminished, however, since the discontinued Libyan training camps
                            have been replaced by new ones in Lebanon. Whether these new camps
                            employ Libyan instructors is not known. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>19. Another indicator of change in Libya’s aid to terrorists is Tripoli’s
                            probable decision to end its close relationship with “Carlos,” a
                            Venezuelan-born <gloss target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss> operative who led
                            several sensational terrorist attacks in the past. Housed at “The

                            Libyan Intelligence Service planned such operations as the aborted

                            1977. Since 1977, Carlos’ whereabouts have become a matter for intense
                            speculation on the part of several governments. Some reporting suggests
                            that he is still in Libya, other reports have placed him at various
                            times in Iraq, Czechoslovakia, and Aden. [<hi rend="italic">1 line not

                            single Iraqi transaction with the <gloss target="#t_PFLP_1">PFLP</gloss>
                            in January 1978 involved the physical transfer of 18 tons of weapons and

                        <p>21. In any case, one aspect of the Libyan-Palestinian relationship is

                            since mid-1977 he is known to have asked Palestinian groups to aid Libya

                            to be his foremost targets. He recently told Moroccan officials that
                            Libya was no longer providing military support to the Polisario Front;
                            the Moroccans do not take him at his word, however, and it is likely
                            that Polisario guerrillas are still training in Libya. Last October the
                            Yemen Arab Republic Government accused the Libyans of involvement in an
                            unsuccessful coup attempt. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and

                            and Uganda are the best examples. Libyan and Soviet instructors train

                            may also be used for the same purpose. During the last months of Idi
                            Amin’s rule in Uganda, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            not only dispatched Libyan troops to fight the invading forces, but sent

                            Libya had supported various anti-Shah terrorist organizations. There

                            equipment for Turkish Kurds, but in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, not
                            Libya. However, the Libyan Foreign Secretary did say in January 1979
                            that the Kurdish question was one which needed a “political” solution.

                        <p>27. Libya continues to send arms and money to the Moro National
                            Liberation Front (MNLF), a Muslim organization seeking independence for
                            part of the southern Philippines. Until recently, Libya openly boasted
                            that it was aiding the MNLF militarily and financially. In October 1977,
                            the Libyan ambassador to the Philippines announced that Libyan relief
                            funds for the Muslims would, in the future, be channeled through the
                            government of the Philippines. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        <p>28. Since 1977, Libya has increased aid to another Asian Muslim group,

                            separatists for terrorist actions in Sri Lanka. There has been
                            considerable friction lately between the Muslim Tamil and the Hindu
                            Singhalese on the island and this may be another case where Libya is

                        <p>29. Libya’s relationship with Bangladesh is ambiguous. In November of
                            1977, Libya was strongly suspected of abetting a coup attempt with some
                            Soviet help. [<hi rend="italic">5 lines not declassified</hi>] [<hi

                        <p>30. Although <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> enjoys the
                            attention he receives from the Third World, he is apparently having
                            second thoughts about supporting revolutionary movements only distantly
                            related to Arab or Muslim goals. During a recent conference of Latin
                            American guerrilla groups in Tripoli, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> benefitted from being portrayed as a staunch
                            supporter of revolutions in Latin America. But when representatives of
                            Nicaragua’s Sandinista guerrillas later approached him for SA–7 rockets,
                            he turned down their request, saying Libya would “consider” sending only
                            small arms shipments. [<hi rend="italic">classification marking and

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            Motivations</p>
                        <p>31. Libya’s present attempts to improve its image in the West as well as
                            its generally more cautious approach in supporting extremist groups are
                            motivated by a variety of external and internal concerns. As mentioned
                            above, Foreign Secretary Turayki last January pointed to possible
                            Western economic embargoes. Moreover, a realignment of power in the
                            Middle East has followed the opening of the Egyptian-Israeli dialogue.
                            Cairo no longer need worry about a military threat from Israel, and may
                            deal more forcefully with a neighbor which has periodically supported
                            terrorist raids inside Egypt. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> has recently expressed concern regarding an
                            Egyptian military buildup on Libya’s borders. In addition, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> feels politically insecure at
                            home, suggested by his constant shuffling of key personnel, especially
                            of his security and intelligence officers. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >classification marking and handling restriction not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>32. Given <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s personality,
                            his newly cautious approach to terrorism could easily be short-lived.
                            His need to be in the limelight is likely eventually to impel him toward
                            resuming more active support for various revolutionary groups.
                            Nonetheless, for at least the short run, he has attempted to repair some
                            of the damage his earlier policies as a patron for international
                            terrorism has wrought, in an effort to be accepted as an influential
                            world leader rather than an outlaw chieftain. [<hi rend="italic"

                            the <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> visit. As a result,
                            Libya immediately welcomed the request for a mission. Libya believes in
                            dialogue and contacts in a small and interdependent world. If we do not
                            face the problems of the world as one united family, we cannot overcome
                            them. Although we may laugh at propaganda against Libya in the United
                            States media, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> can see for
                            himself the progress that has been made. As he can see, the U.S. media
                            does not reflect the true picture. Although he is satisfied that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> as a former U.S.
                            Ambassador to Libya will help the mission, he would also welcome other
                            converts to the Libyan side. In the Arab tradition, he welcomed his
                            guests and asked to hear <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"

                            it has been nearly nine years since a senior U.S. official had the
                            opportunity to speak with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            and hear his views on Libyan policy. That is too long a time.</p>
                        <p>We have many important bilateral interests. Our people have worked
                            closely with Libyans for many years in the development of Libya. We have
                            appreciated its continuing hospitality to our citizens in Libya. We have
                            important trade relations and support the development of Libya. We also
                            genuinely support the continued independence of Arab nations. We have
                            differences, however, and I am here to discuss these candidly. As Major
                            Jallud said, the impression of Libya conveyed by the media may not be
                            fully accurate, such as the impression of its support for movements
                            around the world which some regard as linked to terrorism. There is
                            certainly some exaggeration in this, and many do not understand Libya’s
                            commitment to the Palestinian and liberation movements. It would help to
                            know how Major Jallud sees Libya’s role in this part of the world and
                            relations with Egypt and the Palestinians in the context of its active
                            policies in both the Middle East and Africa.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Jallud</hi> interjected that, as far as he knew from a
                            prior briefing by Secretary-General Turayki and what he had heard, he
                            concluded that <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> wanted
                            only to hear his views and discuss possibilities of dialogue. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> carried no concrete
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName></hi>
                            replied that his mission was to continue the dialogue and to explore
                            problems on the basis of his knowledge of Libya. Jallud’s <pb n="254"
                                facs="0275" xml:id="pg_254"/>comments would be helpful, and he would
                            report to the President the Major’s expression of current Libyan
                            policies and concerns. They would be most helpful in reaching decisions
                            to be made in our bilateral and broader relations. Foreign Secretary
                            Turayki has visited us in Washington, Charge <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWL_1">Eagleton</persName> is in touch with Foreign
                            Ministry officials, and we have read many declarations by Libya’s
                            leadership. He could also convey from his experience here the deep
                            emotions of Libya’s people on Palestine and their deep sensitivities on
                            questions of sovereignty and liberty, but there is no substitute for
                            direct expression by Libya’s leaders to someone in touch with the
                            President and Secretary. The whole question of efforts to bring peace in
                            the Middle East rests on the rights of the Palestinians and the role of
                            countries of the area in this process. It is of utmost importance to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>. While we can
                            keep bilateral and other issues separate, a clear understanding of
                            Libya’s policies is necessary in order to deal with a variety of
                            attitudes, some hostile toward Libya, in Washington.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Jallud</hi> commented that, although dialogue is
                            desirable, he would like to express regret, since he had expected to
                            hear concrete proposals from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>. Libya should have been in the position of a
                            listener. Since the mission is to have a dialogue and exchange ideas, he
                            would, however, express his views. In spite of big differences between
                            us, since 1969 Libya has never said no to a dialogue. While we cannot
                            separate bilateral from general relations involving the destiny of Arab
                            nations and Libya, we believe that improvement in bilateral relations
                            would be a desirable step.</p>
                        <p>He clarified that recent discussions with Tito in Tripoli focused on
                            non-alignment in general, rather than relations with the U.S. Libyans
                            believe, however, that opposition by the U.S. does not help their
                            position of non-alignment. Since Tito’s visit preceded the Havana
                                Summit,<note n="5" xml:id="d101fn5">The Sixth Summit of the
                                Non-Aligned Movement was held in Havana September 3–9.</note> they
                            discussed non-alignment and the <gloss target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss> in
                            general. They informed Tito that present U.S. policies do not help Libya
                            to continue its non-aligned position. In fact, to the extent that the
                            U.S. has bilateral relations with smaller non-aligned countries, it will
                            affect their overall position of non-alignment. Libyans believe that
                            third-world countries all desire to be non-aligned. In the final
                            analysis, when you have a strong enemy pushing you to the wall and
                            cannot withstand the pressure, it will force you to be aligned in order
                            to fight for your own survival. This is not particular to Libya, but is
                            a general principle. The question Libyans ask is what the U.S. wants
                            vis-a-vis bilateral relations. Libyans are not the kind of people to be
                            affected by pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="255" facs="0276" xml:id="pg_255"/>
                        <p>During the last ten years of the revolution, Libya was the underdog in
                            relations with the U.S. while the latter continued a favorable
                            commercial exchange. Libya was subjected to a situation which was not to
                            its advantage. Now, it must take a stand and start to think. It must
                            review the situation and state that it cannot continue as the underdog
                            with U.S. interests safeguarded and Libya’s interests victimized. It is
                            essential that relations be on a reciprocal basis. Libya does not care
                            about profit and loss. It is a matter of principle and dignity. After
                            the revolution, when Libya nationalized some oil, it ran the risk of a
                            boycott and loss of markets for what it believed was the correct
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The Libyans feel that the U.S. people, the President, <persName

                            Libyan people will not allow this situation to continue and will
                            pressure the government to change its attitude to the U.S. when they see
                            the simple fact that transport aircraft, already paid for and with
                            Libyan markings, have been undelivered since 1972 and commercial Boeing
                            aircraft have been embargoed.<note n="6" xml:id="d101fn6">The Deparment

                            hand, Libyans see constant provocation by the U.S. and, on the other, a

                            stand. Libyans are not traders and bargainers. As politicians, they
                            assign their treatment by the U.S. its moral, not material, value. It
                            seems as if Libyans always offer smiles to the U.S.</p>
                        <p>We would like to seize this opportunity to convey to President <persName

                            U.S. that the time has come for the U.S. to end its boycott and respect
                            commitments and signed agreements. If the U.S. had rejected the sale
                            before signature of a contract it would be different. We cannot stand by
                            while you put an embargo on the Boeings.</p>
                        <p>In approaching this question, we look to the U.S. government, not
                            Congress. It is obvious that when Americans and Congress were against
                            Vietnam, the number of troops there reached one million and aircraft
                            1,000. Tomorrow <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> will sign
                            the SALT treaty. The President has already acted on Rhodesia. Nixon
                            acted on Vietnam. We think after <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>’s visit the U.S. should release the C–130s and
                            Boeings. Then we can think of improving relations. It cannot be one

                            explained that, even though Congress is deeply involved and the American
                            public has definite opinions, he represented the President’s own special
                            concerns and would be very frank. There are <pb n="256" facs="0277"
                                xml:id="pg_256"/>very few things today of such overriding importance
                            to the President as peace in the Middle East with recognition and
                            restoration of Palestinian rights in the West Bank and Gaza. The
                            President has decided on pursuing this and means it. There are two
                            routes to a solution. The Rejectionist States see a solution only
                            through armed struggle. We find serious dangers in this approach and
                            cannot foresee success by any of the parties involved. It would be a
                            grave risk to peace. The only other route is through negotiations, and
                            Camp David is based on two phases. The first was the Egyptian-Israeli
                            treaty and the second is self-determination for the Palestinians. We are
                            now involved in the second stage. We do not link this to the question of
                            aircraft but from the President’s standpoint the attitude of states
                            toward the peace process is an important element in his considerations.
                            As we told Turayki, we have had messages from other states participating

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Jallud</hi> responded that U.S. policy would make a big
                            mistake if it believed that Libya would link small bilateral problems
                            with general policy in the Arab world. If Libya engaged in a dialogue,
                            linking bilateral relations with its general position regarding the
                            Middle East, it would be lost in a sea of sand. It is impossible for
                            Libya to change its attitude or policies in regard to the U.S. stand on

                                Policy File, D790272–0467)</note> During that conference, the
                            Palestinians and Arab countries rejected any idea of others having a
                            mandate to <pb n="257" facs="0278" xml:id="pg_257"/>act for them. The
                            Palestinian issue cannot be considered in the absence of the
                            Palestinians themselves.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName></hi>
                            asked if the conference communique represented Palestinian policy or was
                            also the Libyan view. If it represented Libya’s policy, it would be very
                            difficult to explain paragraph 23 of the communique calling for
                            liquidation of all American economic and political interests in the Arab
                            world. Such a statement comes at a time when President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> has risked his political
                            position and made greater efforts than any previous U.S. president to
                            help the Palestinians.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Jallud</hi> responded that the communique was both
                            Palestinian and Libyan policy. What did the U.S. expect from people
                            victimized in both bilateral and multilateral issues? Did we expect that
                            when one party drops a bomb the other offers sweets to eat?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName></hi>
                            pointed out that the President is presently being attacked for
                            statements he has made on behalf of the Palestinians and for efforts he
                            is making to restrict Jewish resettlement and bombing attacks in
                            southern Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>We have considered the sale of C–130 and 747 aircraft with cargo
                            configurations to a country which has already used two American
                            commercial aircraft to support military operations in Uganda and has now
                            subscribed to a declaration on liquidation of American interests in the
                            Arab and Islamic world. The President must consider if it is in our
                            interest to provide additional capacity to a country which seems
                            dedicated to erasing American interests in this part of the world.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Jallud</hi> responded that, after ten years of
                            attempting not to change its policy, Libya might be forced to do so in
                            response to the U.S. position. Did the U.S. expect to be saluted after
                            placing an embargo on civilian aircraft? Interest in improving relations
                            should come from both sides. We are, however, far apart on this issue.
                            We did not expect the U.S. to change its position.</p>

                            visited Libya on June 16–18 to discuss relations with the U.S. and
                            Libyan reaction to the Boeing turndown. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> met with the number two official, Major Jallud,
                            and with the Foreign Minister.<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d101">Document 101</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> was unavailable,
                            apparently because of his mother’s death. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> found the Libyans willing to talk, but firmly
                            opposed to our efforts in the Middle East, unwilling to accept any
                            linkage between what we do bilaterally and their wider policies, and
                            angered by our decision not to supply 747 and C130 aircraft. You will
                            recall that we stopped the 747s after the Libyans used 727s in their
                            operations in Uganda. Following is a summary of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>’s conclusions on possible
                            retaliation against us by Libya and next steps in our relations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Setting</p>
                        <p>Action against U.S. interests in Libya is clearly possible but is not a
                            foregone conclusion. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>’s
                            reception in Tripoli indicates that Libya wants to maintain ties with
                            the U.S., probably to avoid an appearance of dependence on the Soviets
                            and a consequent loss of credibility with non-aligned countries. For
                            this reason, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is also
                            courting the Europeans. He received Foreign Minister Genscher June 18–20
                            and hopes to visit Bonn, Rome, Paris and London during July. Fear of
                            attack by Egypt is another restraining factor, and Jallud specifically
                            raised the issue of U.S. arms supply to Sadat. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said it was only prudent for
                            Egypt to look to its defenses. He told Jallud we were not encouraging
                            any Egyptian moves against Libya and similarly cautioned against any
                            Libyan moves against Egypt. On the other hand, the Libyans have noted
                            that our policy on commercial exports is tougher on them than on Iraq
                            and other rejectionist states. The others, however, are not known to
                            have used commercial aircraft for military operations <pb n="259"
                                facs="0280" xml:id="pg_259"/>as in Uganda. Finally, Libyan reaction
                            to the 747 decision will be affected by a sense of inferiority which
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> noted in repeated
                            references by Jallud and others to being the underdog and “punished” by
                            U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Possible Libyan Actions</p>
                        <p>Direct U.S. interests in Libya consist of 2,500 Americans (principally
                            oil field personnel), oil imports of 700,000 bpd (10% of our imported
                            oil), and investments with a current replacement value of $2.5 billion.
                            If Libya decides to retaliate, a total embargo on oil is probably not
                            feasible unless they cut back production which <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has thus far been reluctant to
                            do. (Tunisian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> confirmed this assessment to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>).<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>.</note> More likely,
                            Libya would interrupt present marketing arrangements with the U.S.,
                            placing more oil on the spot market and seeking new contracts with
                            Europe. We know that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            broached the possibility of expanded oil markets in Germany with
                            Genscher this week. Other gestures, not to be excluded, given the
                            emotional element in Libyan policy, include severing diplomatic
                            relations, offering naval facilities to the Soviets, or nationalizing
                            less productive U.S. petroleum-related investments. We will in the next
                            month be sending an analyst to Libya to develop further what Libya’s
                            options and general policies may be.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Steps</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> promised the Libyans he
                            would report to you on his conversations and provide a further response
                            to them after the Asian Summit meetings. The Libyans may also defer
                            possible action until after the Muslim month of Ramadan beginning July
                            25. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has no major speeches
                            scheduled until the Tenth Anniversary of the Libyan Revolution on
                            September 1. On my return from Asia, I will propose to Foreign Minister
                            Turayki that we meet for further discussion while he is at the General
                            Assembly in September.<note n="4" xml:id="d102fn4">See <ref

                            still have the option of releasing the 747s, but do not recommend it in

                            licenses expire and do not intend to reconsider. We have asked Commerce
                            to review all four-wheel drive vehicles on a case-by-case basis and will
                            carefully review pending orders for jeeps without taking immediate
                            decisions. We hope by these actions to buy some time before Libya takes
                            a decision.</p>

                            <p>1. Relations between the United States and Libya regarding the sale
                                of C–130s, 727s, and 747s have over the years taken heavily symbolic
                                overtones, which in large part account for Libya’s consideration of
                                drastic measures in retaliation for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >US</gloss> denial of these planes. The possible nationalization
                                of the remaining <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil company
                                assets in Libya in retaliation for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >US</gloss> Government refusal to permit the sale of transport
                                aircraft to Libya [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            <p>2. The contract for the original contingent of eight C–130s dates
                                back to mid-1969, before the revolution in Libya that brought
                                    <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to power. Those
                                planes were delivered without incident, but by the time the new
                                Libyan regime sought to exercise its right under the contract to
                                purchase another eight planes, it had established a record for
                                supporting terrorism that induced the United States to hold up the
                                export license. (Strictly speaking, the license has not been denied;
                                it is still “under consideration.”) Lockheed had been warned in
                                advance of potential problems with the license but accepted full
                                payment ($4.5 million per plane) from the Libyans, who are still
                                paying monthly storage and service charges for their maintenance in
                                Georgia. The Libyans have chosen to make the issue a matter of
                                principle, not finances; they have refused to re-sell the planes,
                                although with the rise in prices—the C–130, substantially unaltered,
                                now goes for $10.5 million—they would stand to recapture their money
                                and probably make a tidy profit. The C–130 question has remained an
                                irritant in Libyan-<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> relations for
                                years. (U)</p>
                            <p>3. In March 1978, Boeing applied for a license to export two 727s and
                                was turned down. That fall, however, the decision was
                                reversed—apparently the result of Congressional pressure to help out
                                Boeing, <pb n="263" facs="0284" xml:id="pg_263"/>although the
                                reversal also came at a time when the Libyan government was seeking
                                improved relations with the United States to balance its growing
                                ties with the Soviet Union. The license was granted under condition
                                that the aircraft not be put to military use or altered to enhance
                                their military capabilities, and that they not be used for military
                                training. The 727s were delivered in November. (C)</p>
                            <p>4. In March 1979, the United States received evidence that the
                                Libyans had used 727s to transport troops and military equipment to
                                Uganda—though, as it later developed, the 727s used were not those
                                sold under the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> conditions. The
                                United States nevertheless decided that the spirit if not the letter
                                of the agreement had been violated, and decided to block the export
                                of the three 747s. (U)</p>
                            <p>5. The Libyans already had reason for irritation at the United
                                States. They have been attempting for some time to persuade the
                                United States to upgrade its representation in Libya to the
                                ambassadorial level, without success. Libya looks with considerable
                                suspicion at the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> alliance with
                                Egypt, particularly the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                                willingness to help Egypt out with arms, in view of the fact that
                                President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> continues to
                                make preparations for an attack on Libya; <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is also convinced that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-sponsored Egyptian-Israeli
                                peace treaty represents a sell-out of the Palestinians, Syrians, and
                                Jordanians. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> resents
                                    <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> opposition to the Libyan
                                involvement in Uganda and the fact that Libyan oil—10% of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil imports—seems to be given no
                                weight in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> attitude toward
                                Libya. (S)</p>
                            <p>6. Since the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> decision on the 747s
                                was announced, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has
                                made clear his intense annoyance and the fact that he would
                                seriously consider retaliation—specifically by withholding <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil supplies—if the decision were
                                not reversed. During West German Foreign Minister Genscher’s visit
                                in mid-June, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> talked
                                angrily about “anti-Libyan actions” by the United States and
                                indicated that Libya was interested in expanding oil exports to West
                                Germany by shifting oil from <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                                contracts. In a magazine interview given on 25 June, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> said that Libya was
                                “seriously thinking” of reducing or even stopping oil production for
                                two or three years in response to “pressure and threats of
                                invasion.” (The article was originally mistranslated to sound as if
                                the decision to stop production had already been taken, and caused a
                                minor panic on Wall Street.) During the course of his three-week
                                tour of various Arab countries beginning at the end of June,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> apparently
                                attempted to persuade the oil-producing countries that they ought to
                                freeze production to defend Arab rights. He made no converts, but
                                may still be thinking about a unilateral use of the oil weapon.
                                (C)</p>
                            <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has made no public
                                statements implying that he is considering nationalizing the
                                remaining <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil interests in Libya
                                as an alternative form of retaliation, but the step could hold
                                considerable <pb n="264" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_264"/>appeal for
                                him. The move would probably cost him very little, particularly if
                                the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> companies could be induced to
                                remain in place—a strong possibility in light of the current tight
                                oil market. With the tenth anniversary of the Libyan revolution
                                approaching on 1 September, moreover, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                    >Qadhafi</persName> may be tempted to announce the
                                nationalization as a dramatic gesture suitable to the occasion.
                                (C)</p>
                            <p>8. Nevertheless, we believe that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                    >Qadhafi</persName> will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> make a final
                                decision until he has given up hope of persuading the United States
                                to approve the aircraft sales. Moreover, Libya is currently
                                negotiating revenue-sharing agreements with <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                    >US</gloss> and West European firms now operating in the country
                                in an effort to encourage exploration and development commitments;
                                nationalization would presumably upset the applecart.</p>
                            <p>9. Finally, Libya—probably as a result of its own intelligence assets
                                in Egypt—expects an attack from Egypt, possibly as early as this
                                month. It realizes that the United States is the only country that
                                might successfully dissuade <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                    >Sadat</persName> from the attack, and would not wish to
                                alienate the United States—or provoke the United States to support
                                the Egyptians—at this critical juncture. If, however, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> held the United States
                                partly responsible for an Egyptian attack, he might take any one of
                                the following retaliatory moves: nationalization, embargo of oil
                                deliveries to the United States, or possibly even cut off of total
                                production for a time. (S NF)</p>
                            <p>10. After a decision to nationalize, two main issues would remain:
                                terms of compensation and the future role of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> companies in Libya. (U)</p>
                            <p>11. Although companies frequently argue that compensation should be
                                based on replacement cost, net book value or some portion of net
                                book value is more frequently settled on as the basis for a
                                compensation agreement. A comprehensive audit would be required to
                                determine the exact value of these assets and disputes between
                                Tripoli and the companies over the results could be expected.
                                (C)</p>
                            <p>12. One American oil executive has estimated that the net book value
                                of the remaining producing assets of American firms in Libya is
                                around $100 million. This compares with an original cost on the
                                order of $1 billion. American equity in Libyan producing assets
                                currently represents about 30 percent of the total. (C)</p>
                            <p>13. The same American executive estimated that replacement costs for
                                facilities to produce an equivalent amount of production—about
                                600,000 b/d—would amount to between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion.
                                He put the finding costs necessary to establish a reserve base to
                                support this level of production at an additional $1.8–2.6 billion,
                                bringing the grand total for replacement to an estimated $3.4–4.5
                                billion. The compa<pb n="265" facs="0286" xml:id="pg_265"/>nies
                                clearly would not expect the Libyans to agree to such compensation.
                                (C)</p>
                            <p>14. The above estimates do not include an <gloss target="#t_LNG_1"
                                    >LNG</gloss> plant owned by ESSO with an estimated book value of
                                around $35 million and a replacement value of about $800 million.
                                They also do not include an estimated $100 million worth of
                                equipment in Libya belonging to American oil service companies.
                                (C)</p>
                            <p>15. Compensation could take forms other than cash. For example, Libya
                                might offer the companies better long-term purchase agreements
                                “guaranteeing” future access to Libyan crude or a slight discount on
                                crude purchases. The former concessionaries in Kuwait, for example,
                                purchase crude at a 15 cent-per-barrel discount. Current Libyan
                                financial arrangements allow the companies operating there to
                                maintain a 50–55 cent per barrel profit margin on their equity oil.
                                (C)</p>
                            <p>16. While the Libyans need technical assistance, they do not
                                necessarily need <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> technical
                                assistance. Although <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> oil
                                technology and services are in general superior to those of other
                                nations, Tripoli probably would be willing to arrange technical
                                service contracts with non-<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> firms
                                to replace <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operators. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> could probably obtain good
                                terms in the current market by providing access to Libyan crude
                                denied to the nationalized <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                                companies. Similarly, while the Libyans clearly want <gloss
                                    target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> investment in exploration and
                                production, they could find European investors. (C)</p>
                            <p>17. If <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> companies are to be
                                excluded from Libya and denied access to Libyan crude, their
                                attempts to find new supplies would put further pressures on the
                                world market. (C)</p>

                        <p>The first thing to do is to judge whether the aircraft embargo issue and
                            other sources of Libyan hostility are likely to precipitate a rash
                            Libyan action or proxy action (sabotage of tankers in the Strait of
                            Hormuz, for example) seriously damaging to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> interests. While the chances of <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s recklessly jeopardizing
                            Libyan oil revenues are low, he could devise a nationalization that
                            keeps the oil flowing. (S)</p>
                        <p>The next thing to do is to consider whether the risk is sufficiently real
                            and great to warrant appeasement of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> on a non-vital but burning issue, i.e., the
                            C–130s or the 747s. I have asked Bob Hormats to get some technical and
                            legal specialists in State to look into the feasibility of a restricted
                            lease of transport aircraft with crews by a <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> company, perhaps with assurance of immediate recall by
                            the lessor if the aircraft are sent on missions outside Libya. This
                            probably is not practicable. Hormats will explore other ideas and report

                            <p>Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has for years
                                expressed his intention to nationalize foreign oil holdings in
                                Libya. These expressions have ordinarily taken the form of
                                interviews with the press.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Form of nationalizations</hi>. There are two forms
                                of nationalization: One is expulsion, the other is participation.
                                Expulsion means that all equity is assumed and corporate expatriate
                                personnel leave the country. Participation, such as in the case of
                                the Kuwait Oil Company (BP and Gulf), means the same people who
                                explore, produce, transport, ship and most importantly market the
                                oil continue their activities, only the price and country take go
                                up. It is not clear from the TD which form of nationalization is
                                meant.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Expulsion</hi>. If the Colonel intends this, he
                                would lose the production expertise of the expatriates and their
                                ability to take care of his marketing. Right now a company, such as
                                Exxon, would rather lift (the figures are illustrative, not
                                definitive) Libyan oil at $23 a barrel rather than Algerian oil of
                                similar quality at $22 a barrel. This is because Libyan oil, which
                                Exxon produces provides them with U.S. income tax foreign tax
                                credits while Algerian oil which they acquire on a straight purchase
                                arrangement gives them no such tax credit. Therefore, Libyan oil
                                even at a higher price is more competitive than Algerian oil in such
                                companies. Guaranteed access to markets is another advantage that
                                the companies provide the producing country; it is not certain
                                whether Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                                understands this but his Oil Minister, Ezzedin Mabrouk certainly
                                does. He knows that, while marketing oil in mid-summer 1979 may not
                                present a difficulty, selling it in a slack market such as most
                                observers see coming within six months will be much more of a
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>Production expertise will be impossible to replace without increased
                                cost and lower output. It can be done, but only with lowered
                                revenues.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Participation</hi>. Colonel <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> could increase government
                                “ownership” of the companies to 100 percent and continue to let the
                                same <pb n="268" facs="0289" xml:id="pg_268"/>operators do what they
                                have been doing all along, <hi rend="italic">a la</hi> Kuwait. This,
                                however, would lower the amount of risk capital put into the country
                                at a time when all indications are that the GOL wants the companies
                                to increase capacity. The companies could continue to benefit from
                                foreign tax credits through a “service fee” arrangement, as they
                                have done in Kuwait, and they would continue their marketing
                                function.</p>
                            <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (7 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                            <p>The Oil Minister and other cooler heads will continue to advise the
                                Colonel against rash action against the companies. While the Colonel
                                has been cited for acting in an irrational manner on some issues, he
                                has never done so regarding oil. He did nationalize (expel) BP and
                                Shell but those companies were not beneficiaries of of foreign tax
                                credits and the American multinationals were forced to take over
                                some of their marketing duties. He did nationalize (expel) Amoseas
                                (Caltex) and Atlantic Richfield but they were new in Libya and their
                                high depreciation allowances made foreign tax credits
                                negligible.</p>

                        <p>1. (S–Entire text)</p>
                        <p>2. Summary: Basic elements of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan
                            bilateral relationship rather than specific current problems were
                            central features of Secretary’s forty-five minute discussion with Libyan
                            Foreign Minister Turayki on Oct. 3. General Tone was frank and direct
                            but cordial and constructive on both sides. Secretary stated <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had no desire to undermine Libyan
                            Government and would neither encourage nor condone such efforts by
                            others. Main causes of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan
                            differences were Libyan support for movements espousing violence and
                            terrorism, and hostile Libyan attitude toward those involved in efforts
                            to achieve <pb n="269" facs="0290" xml:id="pg_269"/>Middle East peace.
                            Turayki stated his government opposed terrorism but reaffirmed Libyan
                            support for <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and certain unspecified
                            African movements. On Middle East he said <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> could not speak for Palestinians but conceded that
                            Libya would not oppose an eventual settlement if the Palestinians
                            themselves agreed. On bilateral <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Libyan relations generally, Turayki said Libyans wanted to
                            improve relations and implied that an exchange of Ambassadors would be
                            helpful but he was not in a hurry. Libyans, he continued, did not
                            understand why U.S. holding up aircraft sales or what good <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> thought it would do. Secretary said
                            exchange of Ambassadors not possible at this time. He noted, however,
                            that other steps were feasible and desirable, e.g., more access at
                            highest levels for existing reps, high level visits and stepped-up
                            efforts to promote cultural exchange. Turayki suggested that some joint
                            group, perhaps in Tripoli, be charged with working out specific
                            proposals to implement such measures. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary’s Oct. 3 bilateral with Libyan Foreign Minister Turayki was
                            attended by Libya’s <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> PermRep Kikhia
                            and a notetaker on Libyan side, and by Deputy Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>, Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> and Country Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName>. Secretary opened
                            discussion by saying he was pleased with the opportunity to start a
                            discussion with Libyan Government at this level. Turayki reciprocated
                            these sentiments. The Secretary said he wanted to make two points at
                            outset: First, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had no desire in any
                            way to undermine Government of Libya, it would give no encouragement to
                            any other government seeking to do this, nor indeed would it condone
                            such an effort. Second, U.S. and Libya did, however, have significant
                            differences which should be fully discussed with the objective of
                            reducing them over time. Turayki agreed, noting U.S. and Libya had
                            enjoyed excellent economic and cultural relations for a long time and
                            that Libya has continued to be interested in further improving relations
                            with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary stated one of the major causes of differences was widespread
                            U.S. perception that Libya supported movements which had as guiding
                            principle the use of violence and terrorism. A second major area of
                            difference was the apparently hostile attitude Libya took to U.S. effort
                            to achieve Middle East peace. At present U.S. agrees to disagree with
                            many Arab countries regarding best course to follow in order to achieve
                            universally shared goal of a peaceful settlement. But Libya goes beyond
                            that in terms its hostility to the whole process and its punitive
                            attitude to the other parties principally engaged in the peace
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>5. Turayki said that as far as terrorism is concerned, his government was
                            against it, although of course it supported <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> and certain movements in Africa. He did not think his
                            government should be held accountable for individual terrorist acts
                            committed by such groups any <pb n="270" facs="0291" xml:id="pg_270"
                            />more than <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> should be for acts of
                            mercenary soldiers who might previously have had training in U.S. Army.
                            As for Middle East, he acknowledged difficulties administration faces in
                            its present effort but questioned correctness of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> approach. Libya particularly objects to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> putting himself in position of
                            speaking for Palestinians. Despite all this, if a settlement could
                            ultimately be achieved which the Palestinians themselves would be
                            willing to accept, “Libya would not be more royal than the King.”</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary acknowledged that Libya had taken positive steps such as
                            subscribing to anti-hijacking convention,<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2"
                                >See <ref target="#d95fn4">footnote 4, Document 95</ref>.</note> but
                            reiterated <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> concern at continued
                            Libyan support for organizations engaged in terrorist acts, some of
                            which have been directed against our own personnel. On the Middle East,
                            Secretary stressed importance of understanding the nature of our
                            step-by-step approach, which is not at all inconsistent with the
                            conviction we share with others that any lasting solution will have to
                            deal effectively with the Palestinian issue. He wanted to be sure that
                            while we might differ on tactics, Libya did not misunderstand us on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>7. Turayki said Libyans were disturbed by use of the word “autonomy” in
                            describing plans for political evolution of West Bank, since term
                            usually referred to a particular condition within a sovereign country,
                            in this case, presumably, Israel. Secretary explained that language in
                            CDA was “full autonomy”, meaning Israel would hold its claims in
                            abeyance while West Bank leaders participated in discussions of longer
                            term future of area with other interested parties; thus use of term did
                            not imply <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> repudiation of principle of
                            opposing occupation of territory by force. Turayki did not dispute this
                            explanation but suggested a need for a specific timetable for Israeli
                            withdrawal, and a need for <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to bring
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> into the peace process.
                            Secretary said <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> foresaw Palestinian
                            participation in peace process and welcomed this prospect—once necessary
                            formulation (<gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> recognition for
                            Israel’s right to exist) had been agreed on. This had almost been
                            achieved in 1977 but <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> was not quite
                            able to agree within itself at that time. <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> was still trying. Turayki said it was necessary not
                            only for <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> to recognize Israeli’s
                            right to exist, but also for the reverse to happen. Turayki, responding
                            to a question, said he believed that there were still differing points
                            of view within <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> but that a decision
                            on this issue taken by the top level would be upheld.</p>
                        <p>8. Turayki said we should not link multilateral and bilateral issues. On
                            bilateral issues, speaking frankly, he thought <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Libyan relations as a whole were far more important than
                            the question of a couple of <pb n="271" facs="0292" xml:id="pg_271"
                            />Boeings or C–130s. Libya could if it needed get them or their
                            equivalent elsewhere, but could not understand why <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> was creating the problem. Was Libya
                            serving as a scapegoat in the region? Secretary replied that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had problems with two Arab countries on
                            the terrorism question, Libya and Iraq, and was following the policy of
                            not selling them equipment that could significantly add to military
                            capabilities. This position might change later on but there was no
                            prospect of a change in the immediate future. Turayki reiterated Libya’s
                            desire for better relations with <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and
                            noted that Libya was a genuinely non-aligned state. He asked how <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> felt the sanctions against Libya helped,
                            whether a couple of Boeings would change the regional balance. Libya has
                            a small population but needs to defend itself, and fortunately has the
                            money to pay for it. <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> knows Libya
                            is not Communist and still supplies arms. Why then the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy? Secretary replied that to answer
                            the question one had to go back to basics and referred to his earlier
                            remarks regarding Libyan support for terrorist groups, and hositility to
                            the peace process. He added that recent Libyan use of Boeing 727’s in
                            Uganda had not helped either, though <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> recognized that these were not the specific aircraft
                            legally constrained from such use. Turayki said he still thought Libya
                            was being discriminated against. Secretary noted that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> does not sell arms to many countries,
                            and does sell other type of equipment to Libya. Turayki questioned
                            practicality of constraints <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> places on
                            arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia, saying that if war broke out
                            in region they would certainly use the arms as they chose. Secretary
                            pointed out that if these arms were used offensively rather than for
                            defensive purposes for which they were sold, we would be legally
                            required to cut off spares.</p>
                        <p>9. Turayki suggested Libya would like to upgrade diplomatic relations
                            with <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, i.e., exchange Ambassadors.
                            Secretary said this was not possible now though we agreed in principle
                            it might be desirable later on. Meanwhile, each side could increase
                            access at high levels of its government to the other’s diplomatic
                            representatives. This should be started at once. There followed a brief
                            discussion of the new People’s Committee which has taken over the Libyan
                            Embassy in Washington. Secretary said this should not create problems as
                            long as all agreed that it continued to act as a diplomatic mission. He
                            asked whether the chairman of the Peoples Bureau would be the head of
                            the Mission. Turayki said his government would let us know about that in
                            a formal note.</p>
                        <p>10. Secretary proposed certain additional steps to improve relations:
                            First, an exchange of visits by high level officials. He hoped that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> or Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> or someone of similar rank
                            could visit Tripoli in the near future. Second, he thought the two
                            countries could work more effectively to develop specific areas of
                            cooperation, <pb n="272" facs="0293" xml:id="pg_272"/>in particular by
                            stimulating broadly-based cultural and educational exchanges.</p>
                        <p>11. Turayki, seconded by Libyan PermRep Kikhia, reacted favorably to the
                            foregoing suggestions. Turayki felt that there was a need for more
                            discussion between the two governments on the terrorism issue. Kikhia
                            felt the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> media were heavily biased
                            against Libya and welcomed advice on what Libya could do about it.
                            Turayki noted that Charge <persName corresp="#p_EWL_1"
                                >Eagleton</persName> was doing a very good job to strengthen <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/Libya relations in Tripoli. He suggested
                            the formation of something like a committee, perhaps involving <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWL_1">Eagleton</persName> and based in Tripoli, to
                            review bilateral relations and work systematically on what needed to be
                            done. The Secretary expressed interest in this idea as the meeting
                                closed.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">In telegram 294915 to Tripoli,

                            dialogue. Differences remain profound, but if Turayki attitude is any
                            judge they may be sufficiently manageable to avoid major break.</p>

                            relations is codified in the Vienna Convention.<note n="3"

                        <p>The Government of the United States still awaits clarification of the

                            with members of the People’s Committee it is necessary that they be
                            accorded official status and the United States Government would welcome
                            a request from the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamarihiya for
                            diplomatic status for those Committee members. It would also be
                            necessary that one member of the People’s Bureau of the Diplomatic
                            Mission be formally designated the official spokesman for the People’s
                            Bureau of the Diplomatic Mission and be recognized as its Chairman,

                            Government will be in a better position to determine the wishes of the

                        <p>310900. Inform Consuls. Subject: Libya SitRep No 1 as of 1200 EST,
                            December 2, 1979.</p>

                        <p>2. Embassy Tripoli was attacked about 10:00 a.m. (3 a.m. EST) on Sunday,
                            December 2, 1979 by a mob of about several hundred (18–25 year-old men)
                            shouting anti-American slogans. By 10:30 the mob was breaking windows
                            and trying to batter down the front door, which did not give. The
                            assault turned to removing the ground floor window grills, and breached
                            the Embassy about 11:10 a.m. (4:10 a.m. EST) through a second floor
                            balcony. The remaining staff retreated to the third floor vault and then
                            left the building about 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. EST) via a trap door and
                            walked to the British Embassy, about 15 minutes away. All employees,
                            American and local departed safely without injury. Fires were
                            subsequently set in the Chancery and extinguished by the local fire
                            department.</p>
                        <pb n="275" facs="0296" xml:id="pg_275"/>
                        <p>The mob had arrived with placards at the time of an anti-American
                            pro-Iranian revolution rally of several thousand people at Tripoli’s
                            Green Square about a mile from the Embassy. Most members were in
                            military fatigues which recently have become standard clothing for
                            students and others in Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>After noon local time (7:00 a.m. EST) and following difficulty in
                            contacting responsible Libyan officials, Charge <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWL_1">Eagleton</persName> made a demarche to Libyan
                            Foreign Secretary Turayki about the damage to the Embassy and the lack
                            of adequate protection. He insisted on strengthened protection for the
                            Embassy and residence of official Americans. Turayki assured <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWL_1">Eagleton</persName> that the security of the
                            Embassy and the American community will be taken care of. He stated that
                            Libya continues to hold the positive positions taken in recent
                            high-level bilateral correspondence.</p>
                        <p>At 4:00 p.m. (10:00 a.m. EST) local time Libyan police were placed in
                            front and at the rear of the Charge’s residence. At 4:15 p.m. (10:15
                            a.m. EST) Charge <persName corresp="#p_EWL_1">Eagleton</persName> was
                            invited to Libyan Foreign Liaison Office to arrange access to the
                            Chancery. He subsequently gained access and confirmed that security has
                            not been violated although the first floor consular and
                            economic/commercial areas have suffered extensive fire and water damage.
                            We reoccupied the Embassy about 7:00 p.m. (noon EST).</p>
                        <p>Guidance has been prepared for the American business community advising
                            it to thin down its staffs and to reduce its presence by sending out
                            dependents to other countries until present tensions cease.</p>
                        <p>Libyan People’s Bureau (Embassy) head <persName corresp="#p_HA_2">Ali
                                el-Houderi</persName> was called in at 10:00 a.m. EST to receive the
                            Department’s protest from Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DM_1">Draper</persName> about the irresponsible conduct
                            of the Libyan Government in handling the attack. The Embassy met with
                            local American business leaders at 6:30 p.m. (11:30 a.m. EST) to advise
                            them on the situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d108fn2">No record of

                        <p>We have advised other North African and nearby posts to reduce classified
                            files to a minimum, to be kept only in secure areas, and again to review
                            with host governments specific arrangements for adequate protection,
                            including designation of specific units. Rabat, Algiers, and Tunis and
                            constituent posts are being considered urgently for a voluntary thinning
                            out of staff and reduction in the number of dependents.</p>

                                    >Document 108</ref>.</note> All information we have suggests
                            that protection at our diplomatic premises was clearly inadequate and
                            that the authorities did not respond during the attack. I expect your
                            government to undertake immediately exceptional measures to protect the
                            official American community in Tripoli and also the unofficial American
                            community in Libya. The situation calls for the designation of special
                            units explicitly assigned to this task, with which the Embassy and other
                            resident Americans can communicate directly as assistance is required
                            and in order to assure an immediate response.</p>

                            relations with Libya. The American diplomatic staff would be reduced
                            from 12 to 5, no consular duties would be performed, and our diplomats
                            would work out of an Interests Section in another country’s embassy.

                                advisability of also notifying Libya.” The aircraft were deployed to
                                Egypt.</note> The SCC agreed that it would be useful to treat this
                            deployment as a routine training operation, stressing that these units
                            would be training with U.S. forces in the Mediterranean and that the
                            aircraft would visit U.S. facilities elsewhere in the region during the
                            deployment. In that regard, it was recommended that we approach the
                            Italians for landing rights in Signonella, Sicily, at the time of
                            notification. Because of the possible implications of U.S. support for
                            Egypt against Libya, we will stress that this was planned before the
                            recent events in Libya. We would anticipate the AWACS aircraft remaining
                            about two weeks in Egypt. Defense is drafting a statement which can be
                            used following notification of allies. This will be discussed further
                            today for consideration at the meeting tomorrow.<note n="4"

                        <p>1891. Subject: Conversation With Ali Houdairi in Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>1. I have just had a wide-ranging 3 hour conversation with Chief of the
                            Libyan Peoples Bureau in Washington, Ali Houdairi, followed by a quick
                            tour of the damaged Embassy. Houdairi worked hard to emphasize prospects
                            for better relations in future. He saw <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> yesterday (December 8) and has an oral message
                            for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> which he
                            will deliver on his return to Washington (via London) probably arriving
                                Tuesday.<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">December 11. See <ref
                                    target="#d117">Document 117</ref>.</note> Houdairi apparently
                            urged <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to receive me (as
                            he had been received by the President) but <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> declined with the comment that he never receives
                            Ambassadors. (He does in fact on rare occasions receive Ambassadors).
                            Instead <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> said he would
                            send a special emissary to talk to me (probably Liaison Secretary Qaud).
                            I will have some frank observations to send back to <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> if this occurs.</p>
                        <p>2. Our conversation centered on what really happened at the Embassy
                            December 2 and the question of security then and in the future. I
                            observed that in the interest of containing the crisis and not
                            foreclosing the future we were not insisting that the Libyan Government
                            acknowledge responsibility for having organized the attack, though we
                            knew very well that elements of the Libyan Government were involved from
                            beginning to end. I gave him details to back up this statement. He
                            seemed genuinely surprised at some of the items, such as tools supplied
                            by the Popular Resistance office across the street and removal some
                            Embassy files to official Libyan vehicles and the Peoples Resistance
                            building. He did not try to refute any of this evidence.</p>
                        <p>3. I told Houdairi that before we could begin our assessment of where we
                            stood and what would be an appropriate U.S. diplomatic establishment in
                            Tripoli in the future, we needed a simple acknowledgement of Libyan
                            responsibility for the lack of security that had resulted in entry of
                            the Embassy. Houdairi seemed to think this would be forthcoming (but we
                            have no idea when).</p>
                        <p>4. On security I bore down hard on the inadequacy of verbal assurances of
                            the kind that proved worthless December 2. He argued <pb n="282"
                                facs="0303" xml:id="pg_282"/>that “it cannot happen again” implying
                            that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had told him so. I
                            replied that even if we were confident that the Libyan Government did
                            not intend that the Embassy should be touched, there was now a
                            proliferation of revolutionary committees eager to display their zeal.
                            We would therefore need automatic access to effective security forces
                            that could be brought to the Embassy in case of an emergency. Houdairi
                            replied that all popular organizations were under the discipline of the
                            government (which of course destroys their claim that the attack was
                            spontaneous). Nevertheless he thought the Libyan authorities would
                            cooperate to provide us the kind of security we believed necessary (this
                            will take some doing!).</p>
                        <p>5. I emphasized that the U.S. Government would be making decisions based
                            on all information and evidence available. I added that consideration
                            the Libyan Government gives to our requirements over the coming days and
                            weeks will have an important bearing on the outcome of our
                            deliberations.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Houdairi remained upbeat in spite of the heavy emphasis on what
                            had been done by whom at the Embassy and our serious security concerns
                            for the future. This optimism (“relations will be [garble—better?] than
                            at any time in the last 10 years”) was apparently based on the fact that
                            a personal contact and relationship has been established between
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and Col.
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d113fn3">Presumably a reference to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s message to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> in response to an earlier
                                message from <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> conveyed
                                by <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to Houdairi on
                                November 27. The messages mostly concerned possible Libyan efforts
                                to secure the release of the U.S. hostages in Iran. The Embassy
                                transmitted <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                                message, which was read to <persName corresp="#p_EWL_1"
                                    >Eagleton</persName> by Shahati in a November 29 meeting, in
                                telegram 1866 from Tripoli, November 29. (National Archives, RG 59,
                                Central Foreign Policy File, D790549–0948)</note> Ironically, this
                            is something we in the Embassy have been hoping would happen for some
                            time. We would like to share Houdairi’s optimism. Indeed, we cannot
                            ignore the fact that it is based on his meeting with the man who counts
                            here. Experience, however, speaks for caution when dealing with
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, and this is only the
                            beginning of the dialogue.</p>

                        <p>1925. Subject: Basis for a Continuing Diplomatic Relationship With
                            Libya.</p>
                        <p>1. (S–Entire text).</p>
                        <p>2. As part of the Department’s documentation on Libya I submit comments
                            by Political Officer Hooper. I cannot take exception to them though
                            there are other considerations that should be discussed before final
                            decisions are made. The following five premises, tested by our
                            experiences in Tripoli, reflect our judgements about the foundations of
                            U.S.-Libyan interests:</p>
                        <p>—A. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is prone to lie. This
                            habit tends to raise doubts about the validity of his remarks contained
                            in official exchanges or public utterances, and about reassurances and
                            pledges conveyed by his representatives in the Libyan Government.</p>
                        <p>—B. The U.S.-Libyan petroleum relationship is self-sustaining. Although
                            American oil company officials find a U.S. diplomatic presence
                            convenient, the absence of U.S. diplomats from Tripoli would not have a
                            significant impact on economic relations predicated upon a clear
                            mutuality of interests.</p>
                        <p>—C. U.S.-Libyan educational/cultural ties are also to some extent
                            self-sustaining. Visa services for Libyan students can be provided by
                            other U.S. Embassies in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>—D. The U.S.-Libyan political dialogue will flounder as long as <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> remains in power. The Libyan
                            leader is fundamentally opposed to U.S. political interests in the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>—E. A U.S. diplomatic presence of undetermined size can provide useful
                            information about developments in Libya to the Washington community. The
                            utility of such a presence, however, must be carefully assessed in the
                            context of the above premises.</p>

                            did not provide it. He favored suspension of relations and the
                            establishment of an interests section. The VP said that was a “soft
                            break” and worried that the mood of this country could explode. You
                            noted the outbreak of guerrilla warfare in Puerto Rico would lead to
                            blaming us for releasing two terrorists.<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5"

                                on September 6.</note> The VP said the average American sees us as
                            impotent cowards and commented that the situation could poison the next
                            election. DA wondered why we should have a “soft break,” noting that
                            Libya was interested in economic relations with us. You replied that it
                            was to prevent a confrontation between the U.S. and Islam. There are
                            more countries than we in hot water. We should suspend relations, demand
                            compensation, and not restore relations until our demands have been
                            satisfied. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said the
                            Libyans were worse than the Pakistanis (about paying compensation?). You
                            said something to the effect that in Iran there was a crisis, in Libya
                            suspension of relations, and in Pakistan the chill was warming (?) at
                            which point the meeting ended. (State attendees were <persName

                            Keeping people in place reduces the chance of an oil cutoff. The same

                            would have to try to reallocate oil. It would be hard to do since the

                            to specifically answer Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> directly. He emphasized that what he had to say
                            was not his own message but <pb n="288" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_288"
                            />rather a summation of messages previously sent and assurances he
                            received during his consultations in Tripoli. Specifically, he indicated
                            that:</p>
                        <p>—The Libyan Government regretted the attack on the Embassy and fully
                            accepted its responsibility to provide adequate security to foreign
                            diplomats.</p>
                        <p>—His government was fully prepared to pay compensation for damage done to
                            the Embassy and that this willingness was a clear recognition of the
                            Libyan Government’s “failure” and “negligence” in not providing adequate
                            security for the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>—Col. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has given his
                            personal assurance to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> that full and adequate protection will be
                            provided to all Americans in Libya so they might live in a “climate of
                            freedom and security”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HA_2">El-Houderi</persName> expressed in general
                            terms his hope and expectation that a “new page had been turned” in
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/Libyan relations and that we both
                            need to “forgive and forget”. He expressed his optimism about the future
                            of our bilateral relations and the hope that the “momentum” now in train
                            would not be allowed to slacken.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> replied to <persName
                                corresp="#p_HA_2">El-Houderi</persName> by welcoming the assurances
                            given and indicating that we will “accept them at face value”. He made
                            it clear, however, that we still would like to see the assurances of
                            future security put into more tangible form. Specifically, he suggested
                            that security units be designated to provide protection for the Embassy
                            and that the Embassy have well established access to these units. In
                            addition he proposed that Charge <persName corresp="#p_EWL_1"
                                >Eagleton</persName> upon his return to Tripoli, be accorded an
                            early meeting with Col. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            to discuss the various issues affecting the operation of our Embassy in
                            Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>, at this point,
                            brought up something which he described as a “troubling problem” which
                            occurs at the “worst possible time”—specifically the arrest and ongoing
                            detention of Bashir Dultz, a German national who has been the budget and
                            fiscal officer at the Embassy for many years. When serving as Ambassador
                            in Tripoli, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> knew Dultz
                            well and has high regard for him. He indicated that this arrest sent all
                            of the wrong signals at a time when Libyan authorities were trying to
                            assure us of future security. He noted particularly that the arrest was
                            causing great nervousness among both national and American employees at
                            the Embassy and that the loss of Dultz’ skill as a B&amp;F officer was
                            causing serious difficulty in getting the Embassy reorganized. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> made it clear that while Dultz’
                            release was not a condition of improved relations, his release or a full
                            explanation of his arrest would certainly improve the “atmosphere”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HA_2">Ali El-Houderi</persName> indicated that he
                            had no direct knowledge of the Dultz case, but was certain that the
                            arrest had nothing to do with the <pb n="289" facs="0310"
                                xml:id="pg_289"/>Embassy. He suggested that Dultz was well known in
                            Tripoli and many believed he was a “spy”. Nonetheless, he undertook to
                            bring the case to the attention of senior Libyan officials and to pursue
                            it when he goes back to Tripoli later this month. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HA_2">El-Houderi</persName> returned to the theme of
                            improved relations and expressed the expectation that while problems
                            still exist, they can and will be worked out.</p>

                            beginning after the Tehran hostage situation is resolved. I told Bill it
                            is important that he attempt to establish a direct channel of

                            following message from “Brother <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>” to be passed to you:</p>
                        <p>“1. Libya condemns the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d119fn2">Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan December 24–25,
                                1979.</note> and is very disturbed by it.</p>
                        <p>“2. While Libya tries to maintain ties with the Soviets, because they are
                            our major supplier of arms which we need to defend ourselves, this is
                            because the United States denies us the arms which we need to defend
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>“3. You (the United States) are the superpower. You should do something
                            to stop this aggression, which we see not only as a threat to
                            Afghanistan but to the entire Middle East. We will support any action
                            which the United States is able to do, or is capable of thinking of, to
                            stop this Soviet imperialism. We are willing to work closely with you on
                            this.”</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_HA_2">Houderi</persName> that if he had any
                            concrete suggestions, we would be interested in hearing them. He said he
                            had none at this time. I suggested that he might ask.</p>
                        <p>I said we would also be interested in knowing whether Libya is willing to
                            act in the United Nations to condemn the Soviet actions. We believe that
                            if Third World nations are willing to take this step, it would be more
                            important than just the U.S. and its allies. He said he would transmit
                            this and wait for a reply.</p>

                        <p>My Staff has conferred with State on this issue. Jonathan Randall has
                            told us that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s remark was
                            made in a jocular manner, and it is our strong inclination not to pick
                            up on it unless he makes it an issue. The best way to find out just what
                            the Colonel has in mind is to arm our Charge with a serious message and
                            then request a direct meeting. (S)</p>
                        <p>A possible opening for our Charge may in fact occur tomorrow. A
                            Congressional delegation is visiting Tripoli, and there is a real
                            possibility that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> will
                            agree to meet with them. If he has the message in hand, <persName
                                corresp="#p_EWL_1">Bill Eagleton</persName> would then be in a
                            position to ask to remain for a one-on-one meeting with <persName

                            let the Colonel know that such a meeting is desired. This will be a
                            useful test of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s real

                            proposed meeting with Col. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>:</p>
                        <p>—Elaborating on the President’s point about security for the Mission, we
                            believe it is necessary for a specific security unit to be designated
                            for the Embassy and its personnel and for the Embassy to have
                            communications access to that unit on a 24-hour a day basis. This is the
                            arrangement which the Libyan People’s Bureau has in Washington.</p>
                        <p>—In terms of the high level contact the President referred to, while it
                            is important for the Charge to see Col. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> himself from time to time, what is essential is
                            that some form of ongoing liaison with the Colonel’s immediate staff be
                            established, i.e., not simply with Shahati or Turayki.</p>
                        <p>—Hopefully such meetings can lay a foundation for the effective
                            discussion with appropriate Libyan officials of all the issues now
                            outstanding between us.</p>
                        <p>—As confirmation of Libyan interest in the security and well-being of our
                            Embassy, we would like to see a tangible expression of cooperation.
                            Specifically, the Embassy has had an outstanding property claim with the
                            Libyan Government for several years. The Colonel’s assistance in
                            obtaining a satisfactory resolution of that claim would be a firm
                            indication of the Libyan Government’s commitment to a sound and
                            equitable relationship. Settlement of this claim could be used in form
                            of suitable property which could be used to construct a new building for
                            the Embassy in Tripoli.</p>
                        <p>—We remain concerned about the status of Embassy national employee Bashir
                            Dultz. His arrest—at a moment when we have been reexamining the whole
                            issue of whether our Embassy personnel can operate under adequate
                            security—has been troublesome. We would hope and expect a prompt and
                            satisfactory resolution of this problem.</p>
                        <p>3. Col. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s response to the
                            President’s message and to the points raised in the above talkers will
                            help determine the ongoing nature of our relationship with Libya. A
                            negative response will, of course, require us to review again the full
                            range of options open to us in deciding upon the level and character of
                            that relationship.</p>

                        <p>3. Begin text: Dear Col. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>:
                            I have asked our Charge in Tripoli to deliver this message so we can
                            establish a foundation for an equitable relationship, based on mutual
                            respect, between our two countries. I appreciated your messages given to
                            me by <persName corresp="#p_HA_2">Ali el-Houderi</persName> of the
                            Libyan People’s Bureau in Washington,<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d117">Documents 117</ref> and <ref target="#d119"
                                    >119</ref>.</note> and want to respond with equal candor.</p>
                        <p>Two things will be essential for a sound relationship between our two
                            countries. First, our official representatives in Libya must be able to
                            go about their duties safely and securely and they must be confident
                            that they can call upon the Libyan authorities for assistance in
                            assuring that security. I therefore welcomed your firm assurances about
                            the future safety and well-being of our representatives. Second, I
                            believe it is essential that your chief representative in Washington and
                            my chief representative in Tripoli have regular access to senior
                            decision makers. The head of the People’s Bureau in Washington will
                            always be able to see us at a high level on important matters. We will
                            plan to proceed on the same basis in Tripoli and would consequently
                            appreciate your designating a close associate of yours with whom our
                            chief representative in Tripoli could remain in close touch.</p>
                        <p>A sound relationship would help in discussing events of significance to
                            both our countries. In this connection, I share your concern over the
                            Soviet move into Afghanistan. The cynical Soviet reaction could be a
                            chilling precedent for challenges to the integrity of other nations,
                            including Afghanistan’s Muslim neighbors. It is obvious from the way the
                            Soviet Union disposed of the Amin government that these neighbors can
                            find little security through policies aimed at appeasing <pb n="295"
                                facs="0316" xml:id="pg_295"/>Moscow. It is up to all of us to help
                            them to stand up to what could be an imminent Soviet challenge.</p>
                        <p>I would hope that you would instruct your representatives in New York and
                            elsewhere to urge the representatives of other non-aligned and Muslim
                            nations to make clear their united opposition to the Soviet action.
                            Libya’s representations could be particularly effective with countries
                            like Ethiopia and PDRY, nations that have concluded treaties of
                            friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union, similar to the one the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> used to justify the overthrow
                            of the Afghan Government, the execution of its President, and the
                            occupation of that country.</p>
                        <p>Pakistan in particular will need support. We will be providing Pakistan
                            with significant economic and military assistance. I hope you will be in
                            touch with the Pakistani Government to ask what Libya could do to be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>Iran could well be the next target of Soviet expansion. This threat is
                            real and may become imminent if Iran’s leaders fail to strengthen the
                            country’s internal cohesion and restore constructive relations with the
                            West. Our ability to rebuild such a relationship, however, is totally
                            frustrated by Iranian refusal to release the American hostages. It is
                            time for them to resolve this matter so that they can turn their
                            attention to the real threat. Perhaps you can persuade them to listen
                            where we cannot.</p>
                        <p>It is my hope that the new year will see the beginning of a new page in
                            Libyan-American relations. We are both men of faith and I hope that you
                            will share my prayers for a peaceful and just solution to the problems
                            that beset your region and our world. End text.</p>

                        <p>1. (S–Entire text).</p>
                        <p>2. Morning January 19 I called on Ahmad Shahati, head of the Foreign
                            Liaison Office, to discuss U.S. Libyan relations and request that I be
                            received by Colonel <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to
                            deliver a message from President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName>. I briefly reviewed the results of my
                            consultations last month in Washington and told Shahati that I had just
                            received a message from the President which he hoped would help
                            establish <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libyan relations on a new
                            and more positive basis. I emphasized that an essential part of this
                            process was the access of the official American representative in Libya
                            to Col <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. Hence the
                            President was asking that I be received, as he had received the Libyan
                            representative, Ali al Houdairi, in Washington. I said I would of course
                            be ready to go to Benghazi to see <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> at any time, but suggested that it might be
                            helpful if Houdairi, who is coming to Tripoli January 26, could
                            accompany me to help ensure that our communication was fully understood
                            and placed in the context of his contacts and efforts in Washington.</p>
                        <p>3. Shahati said he would immediately transmit my request to <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. He was carefully noncommittal
                            as to whether <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would
                            receive me. With a smile he referred to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s comment in a recent press conference about
                            receiving the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> representative if the
                            Americans in Tripoli established a People’s Bureau. I said we assumed
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had been joking and
                            asked Shahati’s opinion. He said it was probably not a joke, but he
                            added that Libya respected the American representation in Tripoli. We
                            agreed that I could probably get the support of the American community
                            if it came to a vote, but I added that of course since we respected the
                            position of the head of the Libyan Peoples Bureau in Washington we
                            expected the same for the representative of the President and American
                            people—all of them, not just the local community—in Tripoli. Shahati
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>4. I observed that since it was not certain how soon I might be seeing
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> there was a part of
                            the President’s message regarding <pb n="297" facs="0318"
                                xml:id="pg_297"/>Afghanistan that I would ask Shahati to transmit to
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> immediately. I then
                            read from notes (with Mukhtar Jamal recording it) the part of the
                            message on Afghanistan with direct quotes on the request for advice to
                            non-aligned and Muslim nations and the need to support Pakistan. Shahati
                            showed considerable interest and concern about Afghanistan and asked a
                            number of questions regarding the danger to neighbors. I emphasized the
                            vulnerable position of Pakistan and Iran, particularly the latter with
                            its unstable internal political situation and long term Russian
                            ambitions in the direction of the Indian Ocean through Baluchistan.
                            Shahati wanted to know the reason for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            concern over such a distant land, and I gave him some historical
                            background. He noted approvingly that we were offering 400 million
                            dollars of aid to Pakistan and, with a logic that I did not entirely
                            follow, he asked whether this was not a time to do something for Libya
                            by getting “the aircraft” passed through Congress. I explained that it
                            was not exactly a question of getting the Congress to pass on the
                            aircraft but rather involved the overall impression of the Congress,
                            Executive and people toward Libya and its policies. I noted that a
                            clearer perception of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            attitude toward the hostages in Tehran and toward Afghanistan could be
                            helpful in this regard. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            would have an opportunity to make his position known to the American
                            public when he is interviewed by Harry Reasoner of CBS in Benghazi a
                            week from now.</p>
                        <p>5. In concluding, I told Shahati that for the next few days I could be
                            reached in Tunis through the Embassy here and that I would be on hand in
                            Benghazi on short notice if the Colonel wished to receive me.</p>
                        <p>6. Comment: Ideally the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> would take place when Ali al Houdairi is here to
                            ensure that there are no misunderstandings and that follow up actions
                            are initiated to put both relations and the Embassy on a new footing.
                            There remains some question whether <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> will in fact receive me. With Houdairi here the
                            chances of such a meeting will increase, and if it does not come off
                            under such favorable circumstances we will know that a considered policy
                            decision is involved on <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            part and not simply a typical Libyan communications failure.</p>

                        <p>Our Charge in Tripoli returned to his post December 31 with the
                            expectation that he would, shortly thereafter, be received by <persName

                            receive the assurances we were seeking as a basis for returning to a
                            more normal diplomatic relationship. We sent him your message to
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> on January 17 and he
                            informed the Foreign Office that he had such a message.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d125fn2">See <ref target="#d123">Documents 123</ref> and

                                >Qadhafi</persName> may not intend to carry through with his part of
                            the bargain. We need to decide whether to keep our Embassy at its
                            present minimum size. We need your advice on the disposition of your
                            message to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> which was
                            intended to be delivered personally to him.</p>

                            positive response, there is another reason for postponing a decision on
                            the future of our Embassy until some time in March: the possibility that
                            Libyans or Palestinians—possibly without government approval—will
                            undertake further actions or demonstrations against the U.S. during this
                            present period of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt,
                            including an exchange of ambassadors between the two countries in late
                            February. To avoid a repetition of the December 2 attack, I believe that
                            during this period we should keep the mission drawn down to the lowest
                            level possible and undertake no visa issuing or consular activities
                            other than those minimally required to ensure protection of
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>While the exchanges you and Zbig have had from time to time since early
                            December with the Libyan representatives in Washington have produced
                            assurances made on <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            behalf that he wants <pb n="299" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_299"/>better
                            relations and will forestall future assaults on the Embassy, the Libyan
                            behavior pattern in this period remains erratic.</p>
                        <p>The following list of recent Libyan activity is not exceptional but
                            represents the normal pattern of Libyan external involvement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s soothing words can quickly
                            change to vehement invective and his explosive and changeable nature
                            must be constantly taken into account. The weight of intelligence
                            evidence suggests that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            himself authorized the attack on our Embassy in order to prove that his
                            government was at least as “revolutionary” as the Iranians.<note n="3"

                            One can never be certain as to when he will again need to prove his
                            revolutionary credentials:</p>
                        <p>—There is mounting evidence that the commandos who attacked Gafsa,
                            Tunisia on January 27 were trained, financed, and aided by Libya.<note

                        <p>—Despite a call for the release of the Tehran hostages, Libya has made it
                            clear that it will give full and complete support to Iran in any
                            confrontation with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>—On Afghanistan, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is
                            concerned and wants us to help Pakistan, but the Libyan delegate was
                            absent for the General Assembly vote on the condemnation of the Soviet
                            aggression. Libyan Foreign Minister Turayki has publicly defended the
                            Russians, saying that “no one can separate the Arab Nation from a real
                            friend and ally represented in the Soviet Union.”</p>
                        <p>—A recent intelligence report indicates that the Libyan Air Force is
                            carefully monitoring U.S. Sixth Fleet activity in the Mediterranean and
                            may plan to challenge U.S. aircraft over international waters—recent
                            radar lock-on incidents tend to confirm this monitoring activity.<note

                        <p>—<persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is seeking to topple
                            Arafat and set up a new Palestinian organization because he believes
                            Arafat is too moderate.</p>
                        <p>—In early January the Central African Republic expelled the Libyan
                            Embassy, citing continuing Libyan-Soviet efforts to undermine the
                            security of the country.</p>
                        <p>Even so, there are still several good reasons, such as our dependence on
                            Libyan oil and our large American community in Libya, for trying to
                            maintain at least a minimal relationship with Tripoli. We are helped by
                            the Libyan fear of an Egyptian attack. However, no fundamental changes
                            in basic Libyan policy or behavior are likely to occur. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is a maverick whose penchant
                            for mischief-making is part of his very nature—and that is not likely to

                        <p>Even in the best of circumstances, the chances of improved relations with
                            Libya are not good and will be affected by other irritants. In
                            particular, the Libyans will continue to make an issue of our
                            unwillingness to sell 747 aircraft or to release the C–130s. While we
                            may decide to retain a mission in Tripoli, we should be under no
                            illusion that, over the long term, we will be able to work with

                        <p>117964. Subject: Expulsion of Libyan Diplomats.</p>
                        <p>1. The following note was presented to the Libyan People’s Bureau on May
                            2: “The Department of State hereby notifies the People’s Bureau of the
                            Diplomatic Mission of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahariya that
                            it is aware that members of the staff of the Bureau, Messrs. Nuri
                            Swedan, Ali Ramram, Mohammad Gamudi, and Abdula Zbedi have engaged in
                            conduct which the United States deems unacceptable. In accordance with
                            Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, these
                            persons are herewith declared not acceptable. They are required to
                            depart the United States within 72 hours. Thereafter, the United States
                            will no longer regard them as members of the staff of the People’s
                            Bureau entitled to the privileges, immunities and protection which they
                            now enjoy by virtue of their official status and they will be subject to
                            immediate expulsion.</p>
                        <p>Prior to their departure, these persons will be restricted to travel only
                            by regularly traveled routes between their homes and offices and travel
                            within a one mile radius of their homes as is necessary in connection
                            with final departure preparations. Failure to observe these restrictions
                            will result in the immediate termination of official status and
                            immediate expulsion of the individual concerned. The People’s Bureau is
                            further advised of its obligation to communicate to the Department of
                            State the precise departure times of these persons.</p>
                        <p>The Department reminds the People’s Bureau of the specific duty, as set
                            forth in Article 41 of the Vienna Diplomatic Relations Convention, of
                            all persons enjoying privileges and immunities to respect the laws and
                            regulations of the receiving state.”</p>
                        <p>2. At the time of the presentation of the note the following points were
                            made:</p>
                        <p>—The United States Government, in declaring persona non grata two
                            diplomats from the Libyan People’s Bureau on April 6, made it clear that
                            acts of intimidation against Libyan students in the United States would
                            not be tolerated.</p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="0325" xml:id="pg_304"/>
                        <p>—At that time we told you that if these activities continued, other
                            members of the staff of the People’s Bureau could face expulsion—but if
                            the activities ceased we were prepared to regard the incident as
                            closed.</p>
                        <p>—We very much regret that your government has chosen to disregard this
                            warning and that these activities are continuing in several countries,
                            including the United States.</p>
                        <p>—Public statements by Libyan leaders—including open threats of the need
                            for “elimination” of opposition—may have been interpreted by some Libyan
                            officials in a manner involving a need to intimidate and threaten
                            others. You are well aware, for example, of the allegations concerning
                            the two murders of Libyans in London and the two in Rome and of your
                            fellow countrymen now being held by the police of those countries.<note

                                132</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>—Our action today is not based upon guesses and allegations; and you
                            should know that we are acting on the basis of firm evidence. You are
                            aware that our FBI has been very active in investigating the apparent
                            campaign of intimidation in order to protect Libyan students in the U.S.
                            That investigation has convinced us that this additional action is
                            required. While it is not necessary in diplomatic situations to go into
                            detail, you should therefore be assured that in expelling these four
                            officials, we are acting on the basis of considerable evidence and
                            information.</p>
                        <p>—As previously—we must warn you in the strongest possible terms that any

                            citizens or not—receive the full protection of U.S. law. We cannot

                        <p>—When the People’s Bureau was first established there was much talk of
                            dialogue. We welcomed that and tried to respond in a substantive
                            fashion. We still desire improved relations with Tripoli; we are still
                            willing to work with the People’s Bureau. There are, however, certain
                            standards and norms of international conduct which cannot be
                                ignored.<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">Also on May 2, the Department

                            following steps this afternoon (and is now consulting with Justice):</p>
                        <p>—to call in the head of the Libyan mission and make these points:</p>
                        <quote><p>—in addition to the need for the 4 PNG’d officers to leave;</p>
                            <p>—the Mission must complete the process of regularizing its status as
                                a diplomatic mission under the Vienna Convention;</p>
                            <p>—it must complete the relevant forms, and submit them to
                                Protocol;</p>
                            <p>—any official relations must be conducted in accordance with U.S. law
                                and international practice and convention;</p>
                            <p>—<hi rend="italic">failing this</hi>, the mission must be closed,
                                effective within 24 hours of delivery of the note; and</p>
                            <p>—for all persons whose status has not been regularized, visas will be
                                revoked, and they will be expected to leave the country;</p></quote>
                        <p>—in implementing the above, State would (probably) prevent the entry to
                            the mission by anyone, and escort anyone leaving to the airport. (S)</p>
                        <p>State wanted this brought to your attention, in particular because of two
                            possible retaliatory actions by Libya:</p>
                        <p>—harassment (or worse) of the U.S. community in Libya (which State judges
                            to be a moderate risk, since Libya needs these people); and</p>
                        <p>—a possible reduction or cut-off of oil supplies to the U.S., which are
                            9% of our imports. (S)</p>
                        <p>At the same time, at the noon briefing, State will say:</p>
                        <p>—we continue to require the 4 officers to leave; and</p>
                        <p>—we will be in further touch with the Libyan mission in the near future
                            with regard to the overall status of the mission, to make our views
                            known. (C)</p>

                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has suffered a number of
                            setbacks in those areas he considers most important: championing the
                            cause of Islam, the Palestinians, and pan-Arabism.</p>
                        <p>One of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s major
                            psychological setbacks was the publicity garnered during 1979 by the
                            Iranian Revolution, and particularly by Khomeini. Prior to the fall of
                            the Shah, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> styled himself
                            the leading spokesman for Islam and saw Libya as the prime source of
                            Islamic ferment. Khomeini appeared, captured world attention, and
                            capitalized on a growing resurgence of Islamic self-awareness worldwide.
                            Although <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> hailed the
                            Iranian Revolution and claimed it was modeled on his own, Libya’s
                            relations with Khomeini’s Iran have been very uneven. The Iranians
                            believe, with good reason, that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> caused the disappearance of the Lebanese Shia
                            leader Imam Musa <pb n="312" facs="0333" xml:id="pg_312"/>Sadr. Because
                            of this, Iranian clerical leaders are reluctant to accept <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s profferred friendship and
                            have kept him at arm’s length.</p>
                        <p>For the near term, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is
                            likely to continue to be fascinated by the Iranian revolution and seek
                            ways to capitalize on it. The sacking of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> embassy in Tripoli in November 1979 was a crude
                            imitation of the seizure of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            embassy in Tehran. <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is
                            likely, however, to become increasingly jealous of Iranian prominence in
                            Islamic affairs, and his relationship with Iran may become increasingly
                            adversarial. Before the fall of the Shah, Libya helped train Iranian
                            terrorists. While there is no evidence of current Libyan meddling in
                            Iranian internal affairs, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            might be tempted to contact opponents of the Tehran government if
                            relations between Tehran and Tripoli deteriorated further.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>, must be regarded as
                            a setback for him. As one of the major contributors to the Palestinian
                            cause (financial aid, weapons, and training) <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> has always sought a correspondingly major role
                            in helping to shape Palestinian policy. The <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss>, and Arafat in particular, have resisted <persName

                            between Fatah and Libya is partly the result of the conflict between
                            Arafat’s inclination to work out a diplomatic solution to the
                            Palestinian problem and <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            call for military action against the signers of the Camp David accords.
                            Arafat has also intimated he can live with Israel, whereas <persName

                        <p>The toppling of the Amin and Bokassa regimes were also serious setbacks
                            for <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. In addition, Libya
                            is embroiled in the conflict in Chad and likely to come up against his
                            old nemesis, the French.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> faces continued discontent
                            among his own people, and there have been several assassination attempts
                            against him recently. His much publicized recent campaign against
                            corruption and dissent seems to have further alienated the military. He
                            is also increasingly paranoid about Libyan exiles and wants them
                            silenced.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> is also clearly not served
                            by his reorganization of the Libyan Foreign Affairs Secretariat, which
                            is apparently in the process of being phased out and replaced by the
                            Foreign Liaison Office of the Libyan General People’s Congress. Such
                            expertise in determining and implementing foreign policy as Libya had

                            the regime published a declaration calling for the physical liquidation
                            of enemies of the revolution abroad. Within a few weeks a Libyan student
                            was kidnaped in London by members of the Libyan “people’s

                        <p>Alfred: You will be asked a lot of the questions that could have been
                            asked if the Zorinsky bill had gone through. Questions such as “how
                            often did you see people like Houdairi?”</p>
                        <p>ZB: To the extent it is germane I will reply. But I am going there to
                            discuss a specific case.</p>

                                >Lance</persName> disarmed the committee at the beginning by the
                            length and detail of his statement. He provided everything. They did not
                            have to drag any information out. Any information dragged out leaves the
                            impression that there is more information to be dragged out. While the
                            people there are your friends, they are up for election—Leahy, Mathias,
                            Bayh are all up for election—so it is not a friendly operation. You also
                            have to be prepared for questions that are totally off the wall.</p>
                        <p>DA: Your attitude cannot be one of saying, “that is not the reason I am
                            here.”</p>
                        <p>ZB: I don’t intend to antagonize them and will keep my cool even if I am
                            abused.</p>
                        <p>DA: On handling questions, I strongly recommend that you be as
                            professorial as possible in your choice of language. Don’t give them
                            your good one-liners.</p>
                        <p>Alfred: Whether it is <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>
                            or ZB who gives the overview of the Libyan relationship should be
                            decided.</p>
                        <p>ZB: It has not been my primary responsibility and I am not in a position
                            to give a thorough detailed review of this matter.</p>
                        <p>Alfred: You should have from State a detailed overview including the
                            number of times <persName corresp="#p_RWA_1">Roy</persName>, <persName

                        <p>ZB will dictate a preliminary statement dealing with the three
                            encounters—November 20 and 27 phone calls and meeting; subsequent
                            meetings with Houdairi, and the March phone call; and the meeting in
                                July.<note n="14" xml:id="d133fn14">Not further identified.</note>

                        <p>3. Then some comments on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Libya
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>There should also be some comments on ZB/JC family relations. It just so
                            happens ZB has not had much contact, but has seen Mrs. Stapleton, Miss
                            Lillian prior to trips abroad. Specific examples?</p>
                        <p>DA: What prompted you to make the March phone call. Will you give them
                            the piece of paper that you had?<note n="15" xml:id="d133fn15">Not
                                found.</note> Why didn’t you give the piece of paper to somebody
                            else? You knew that Billy was being investigated. What made you assume
                            the law enforcement agencies had that piece of paper? Get into the
                            dissemination thing because all of that stuff automatically goes to
                            Justice. Who would have seen it? This should be done from the standpoint
                            of the system that provides privacy. David to prepare this part of the
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>ZB: In addition to briefing the President on it I knew, because of the
                            established system, that this paper would reach the following agencies
                            for the following reasons. David to write this. My own judgment was that
                            it was important for me to make certain that Billy not engage in
                            anything embarrassing or unethical—on the face of it I saw nothing
                            illegal. Why didn’t it get to Justice? I will take position that when I
                            saw the report I acted on it by phoning <persName corresp="#p_CWA_1"
                                >Billy Carter</persName> and telling him not to do anything
                            embarrassing to the Administration or to the President personally. I do
                            not feel I should comment on the relationship between the two brothers,
                            which is difficult and sensitive.</p>
                        <p>Alfred: Didn’t it occur to you all in November that the one thing that
                            this would do is make the Libyans think that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWA_1">Billy Carter</persName> was very important?</p>
                        <p>ZB: That is hindsight. We didn’t know. Besides, they already knew that he
                            was the President’s brother and we knew that they already had a high
                            estimate of him. We were trying to exploit that. What if it had resulted
                            in the release of the hostages? Who would have complained?</p>
                        <p>Alfred: With all of the history between <persName corresp="#p_CWA_1"
                                >Billy Carter</persName> and the Libyans how could you have ignored
                            the possibility that this gesture would have enhanced him greatly?</p>
                        <p>ZB. We didn’t think it would enhance him over and above the fact that he
                            was the President’s brother. All he did was introduce me to the Libyan
                            official. We wanted to convey to the charge that this was a matter of
                            high importance and that the President was personally interested. This
                            was not just a routine approach.</p>
                        <p>When were the 13 released?</p>
                        <pb n="320" facs="0341" xml:id="pg_320"/>
                        <p>Alfred: The press is playing up the coincidence that you used Billy in
                            November and in March they gave him a down payment.</p>
                        <p>We should try to get together a chronology of public statements made
                            about Billy and Libya. One of the things that staffers will do is go
                            through what is available and jump at it.</p>
                        <p>Why didn’t you make it clear that <persName corresp="#p_CWA_1">Billy
                                Carter</persName> was not speaking for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> Government? Why didn’t you tell the Libyans to treat him
                            like anybody else?</p>
                        <p>ZB: For one thing I certainly had no knowledge that he was on a retainer
                            or that he was about to get a loan from them.</p>
                        <p>DA: One of the magazines had a piece about Billy’s Libya connection. It
                            was quite extensive and made his contacts clear.<note n="16"

                        <p>Les: I will start a file and as everybody develops information we will
                            compile it for future reference. Any questions you need to get answers
                            to will be here.</p>
                        <p>Bob Kimmitt should try to work out what NSC policy is on briefing people.
                            How do outsiders get briefings? Do you give secure information to
                            uncleared people? This should be taken up at the Staff meeting. What are
                            the instinctive rules that people follow in talking with people.</p>
                        <p>Madeleine: Try to find out what State has in a way that they can’t wave a
                            piece of paper in the middle of this that we are not aware of.</p>
                        <p>DA: We should ask State for every single message during this period. I
                            would get all traffic, all desk memos. What you want to look out for is
                            a little memo that says, “Well, <persName corresp="#p_CWA_1">Billy
                                Carter</persName> is doing all of this but we should stay out of it
                            because he is the President’s brother.”</p>
                        <p>Les: To get it we are going to have to go through <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> or Owen. Then they will,
                            when asked, say that they provided all of this to NSC or to ZB.</p>
                        <p>Madeleine: How do we avoid the danger of something that is floated
                            out?</p>
                        <p>Les: Lloyd Cutler said this morning that State would let us know through
                            him everything that they are doing, all requests they have responded
                            to.</p>
                        <p>Madeleine: We should dovetail with Cutler. Is it good to know everything?
                            Or is it better not to?</p>

                                Relations between the United States and Libya have been uneven and
                                troubled since the current Libyan Government came to power on
                                September 1, 1969. Relations got off to a shaky start because of the
                                close identification between the United States and the government of
                                King Idris. In late 1969 and early 1970, Ambassador Joseph Palmer
                                saw <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> and Prime
                                Minister Abd as-Salam Ahmad Jallud on several occasions but, after
                                the forced closure of Wheelus Air Force Base in June 1970, the
                                Embassy found it virtually impossible to get appointments with
                                anyone except middle-level Foreign Ministry officials.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The 1970–1972 Period</hi>. Throughout the period
                                1970–1972, Ambassador Palmer made it clear to the Libyan Government
                                that the key to good relations was reciprocity—and a dialogue and
                                negotiations—on all points. With reference to the issue of U.S.
                                support for Israel and U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East,
                                Ambassador Palmer told the Libyans that the United States was making
                                genuine efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of which Israeli
                                withdrawal from Arab lands was a part. Palmer was told by Libyan
                                officials that, if there were a change in U.S. Middle Eastern policy
                                or general improvement in the Middle East situation, relations could
                                improve.</p>
                            <p>In addition to Libya’s strident and disruptive Middle East policy and
                                the difficulty of establishing effective communication with the
                                Libyan Government, other significant factors had a negative effect
                                on U.S.-Libyan relations: (1) almost continuous high-level Libyan
                                attacks and denunciations of U.S. policies; (2) Libyan support for
                                Palestinian guerrillas and terrorists through the provision of arms,
                                funds, and training; (3) Libyan support for subversion or insurgency
                                against countries which, in Libya’s view, were not sufficiently
                                militant on the Arab-Israeli issue, were tolerant of U.S. or Soviet
                                influence, or were engaged in suppressing armed Palestinian or
                                Muslim movements within their territories; (4) the termination in

                            <p>As regards the reduction in the Embassy staff, the Libyans said that
                                it was an effort to curtail and to control what the Libyans referred
                                to as “non-diplomatic activities” of the Embassy staff and also
                                because of Libyan dissatisfaction over the 1972 U.S. refusals to
                                allow the export to Libya of C–130 aircraft contracted and paid for
                                by the Libyan Government or the purchase of F–5 fighter
                                    aircraft.<note n="8" xml:id="d134fn8">See <ref

                            <p>In early 1973, we decided to maintain diplomatic relations with Libya
                                and to maintain an official presence in Tripoli headed by a Charge;
                                but not to appoint an Ambassador. Our reasons were based on the
                                following policy concerns: (1) to endeavor to remain in
                                communication with governments with which the United States had
                                serious disagreements; (2) to be in a position to help counter
                                Libya’s disruptive political activism in the Middle East, Africa,
                                and elsewhere, while <pb n="324" facs="0345" xml:id="pg_324"

                                might be able to play on the international scene; (3) to help
                                protect the large remaining private U.S. stake in the Libyan oil
                                industry and the contribution which that investment made to the U.S.
                                balance of payments; (4) to help ensure continued U.S. and Western
                                European access to Libyan oil; (5) to be able to assist
                                approximately 2,800 American citizens living in Libya; (6) to
                                maintain some contact with the Libyan populace; (7) to retain the
                                ability to gather intelligence on Libya; and (8) to be in a position
                                to exploit any change in the Libyan Government.</p>

                                The problem was not that Libya disagreed with U.S. policy but that
                                it actively opposed and sought to undermine U.S. efforts toward a
                                peace settlement in the Middle East and that Libya criticized other

                                Because Libya had continued to undermine the search for peace and to
                                give assistance and refuge to terrorists, relations at the

                                our concern over Libyan support for terrorist groups as well as over
                                the extent to which Libya had become embroiled in confrontations
                                with neighboring states such as Chad and Egypt. This decision
                                greatly increased tensions. In the months following this decision,
                                however, there was at least the impression that Libya was “cleaning
                                up its act.” The style of Libyan support for terrorist groups had
                                been changed. Financial support and training continued, but Libya
                                stretched out the period in which it avoided direct involvement in
                                the planning or execution of international terrorist incidents. In
                                October of 1978, Libya ratified the Hague Convention, the most
                                important of the three international conventions on hijacking (Libya
                                had ratified the Montreal Convention in 1974 and the Tokyo <pb

                                and other factors, coupled with a well argued economic case by the
                                Commerce Department in June 1978, led to a reversal of the
                                Department’s position on the 727s in November of 1978, after we had
                                secured written Libyan assurances that these aircraft would be
                                strictly for civil use.<note n="16" xml:id="d134fn16">See <ref

                                the affairs of other nations would have to improve before this could

                                was at last possible. In January Ahmed Shahati, head of the Libyan
                                Foreign Liaison Office, came to the United States as head of a

                            <p>The 747 decision, however, attracted Congressional criticism. The

                                727 fleet (there is no evidence that the two 727s under specific

                            <p>Our policy since the early 1970s was to prevent the sale to Libya of

                                value. Once commercial civil aviation aircraft had been used for
                                military purposes, we believed that we had no alternative but to
                                apply that policy to the 747 aircraft. Accordingly, in May of 1979,
                                we recommended to the Commerce Department that the export of these
                                aircraft not be allowed. The Libyans were furious.<note n="19"

                                Tunisia had been planned and financed by the Libyans. Tripoli

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> began the meeting by
                            asking for an assessment of the Libyan attack on our reconnaissance
                                aircraft.<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">See <ref target="#d139"

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PJS_1">Pustay</persName> said that our only
                            source for believing that an attack occurred was [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>]; there were no aircraft sighted
                            on U.S. radar, no missiles seen, no damage sustained. The crew of the
                            airplane is now reviewing their tapes. [<hi rend="italic">classification
                                marking not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SG_1">Gary Sick</persName> asked if the Libyans
                            could have staged the entire thing. (C)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJS_1">Pustay</persName> responded that this was a
                            possibility; [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>In response to questions about the nature and location of our
                            reconnaissance flights, <persName corresp="#p_PJS_1">Pustay</persName>
                            pointed out that these flights are well beyond the Libyan-claimed waters
                            and clearly in international airspace. No tracks go into the contested
                            areas. The reconnaissance missions are designed to test Libyan air
                            defense. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> pointed out that, in
                            that case, the flight was a success. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">Aaron</persName> then asked why, in the face
                            of an increasing pattern of Libyan probes, over the past several months,
                            we do not protect these aircraft. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJS_1">Pustay</persName> responded that it is too
                            expensive to keep fighters over our reconnaissance flights. He pointed
                            out that, during the forthcoming naval exercise in the Gulf of Sidra,
                            the carrier KENNEDY will provide cover for these flights. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> then said that, for
                            the immediate future, we should provide CAP for our flights. <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> was tasked to do this. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MDE_1">McGiffert</persName> then asked if we should
                            consider cutting back on the reconnaissance flights through the area
                            (currently about one per day, although none are scheduled until
                            September 21). (S)</p>
                        <pb n="332" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_332"/>
                        <p>All agreed that we should not. (C)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> then turned the
                            discussion to the naval exercise planned for September 20–21 near the
                            Gulf of Sidra. He asked if any ships are planning to venture south of
                            the Libyan-declared line. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PJS_1">Pustay</persName> responded that some
                            vessels, probably frigates, will sail south of the line to warn stray
                            ships in the area and to reassert our contention that the Gulf of Sidra
                            is international waters. No live firing will take place south of the
                            line, however. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Draper</persName> said that State agrees that
                            the exercise should take place as planned. State denied permission for a
                            similar exercise in June only because the time was not right. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> said that the group
                            should stay in close touch over the next few days on the subject of the
                            exercise. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> then asked if we
                            should make a demarche to the Libyans over their harassment of our
                            reconnaissance flights. (S)</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (2 lines) not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> then asked about
                                <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Jack Anderson</persName>’s probes on the
                            Libyan affair. (C)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_FA_2">Friendly</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_AJ_1">Anderson</persName>’s people had picked up on an
                            earlier series of accusations about Libya. Two relevant allegations
                            concern our cancellation of the exercise in June and a supposed Libyan
                            attack against our reconnaissance aircraft. Both questions are
                            manageable. (C)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> then closed the
                            meeting by asking Defense to provide a copy of the rules of engagement
                            for our forces in the exercise and for the CAP which will support our
                            reconnaissance flights in the future. (S)</p>

                                >Qadhafi</persName> made yesterday—the same date as the apparent
                            hostile intercept of the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d136fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> The tone of the
                            speech is bellicose in the extreme, and it lends substance to the
                            seriousness of the Libyan reaction.</p>
                        <p>The last paragraph, in particular, is a virtual call for war with the
                            United States, referring to the forthcoming exercise as an invasion of
                            the Arab homeland. Given the nature of this speech, we would probably be
                            well advised to assume that the attack yesterday was real and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> may in fact be
                            planning some kind of suicide mission in conjunction with our

                        <p>I have talked to State (<persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Draper</persName>)
                            who is intensely aware of the risks. (State is having some psychiatrists
                            examine <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s recent words
                            and behavior on the grounds that he may have finally gone totally
                            insane.) However, <persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Draper</persName>
                            believes—and so do I—that we should proceed with the exercise.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to have another meeting this week to go over the rules of
                            engagement, military options, and risks prior to the commencement of the

                        <p>The meeting was convened as a follow-up to Tuesday’s discussion of Libyan
                            actions directed against our reconnaissance flights and probable
                            reactions to our naval exercise.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">See <ref

                            <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s speech on Tuesday
                            increased awareness of Libya’s threats to challenge us in the
                                region.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">See <ref target="#d136">Document

                        <p>From the discussion, four basic issues emerged to be discussed by the MBB
                            lunch meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d137fn4">No record of the lunch

                        <p>1) Which option for the exercise should be selected?</p>
                        <p>a) Continue the exercise as planned, with limited naval and air
                            surveillance in the area claimed by Libya.</p>
                        <p>b) Modify the exercise so that only air surveillance in the
                            Libyan-claimed area is conducted.</p>
                        <p>c) Keep <hi rend="italic">all</hi> naval and air activity out of the
                            area.</p>

                        <p>There are potential costs to manning the area under threat from Qaddafi
                            as well as possible costs from an incident that might be charged to a
                            deliberate U.S. provocation—particularly in the light of the current
                            Senate investigations.<note n="5" xml:id="d137fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>2) What is the most detailed and accurate assessment of the incident in
                            which the Libyans allegedly fired two missiles at our reconnaissance
                            aircraft in international airspace?</p>
                        <p>3) Should we instruct our embassies in Syria and Libya to make demarches
                            on Qaddafi’s recent threats as they relate to the exercise?</p>
                        <p>4) What are the specific rules of engagement for aircraft and naval
                            vessels located in the Libyan-claimed area? If we pick the aircraft only
                            option (b), should they break off if Libyan aircraft approach or should
                            they stay and plan to defend against any hostile actions?</p>

                        <p>The emergence of the martyrdom theme in <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s recent speeches is not mere rhetorical
                            posturing. It reflects a dangerous state of mind for the erratic Libyan
                            revolutionary, who is prone to aggressive action when under stress.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s rhetoric in association
                            with the call for merger for Libya and Syria reflects a qualitatively
                            different and ominous turn. Characterizing the resolution for merger as
                            “the resolution of death,” he exhorted his people to be prepared to die
                            through confrontation rather than submit. He then went on to identify
                            the target of his aggression: “The forces of exploitation inside the
                            Arab world are but a link in the chain <pb n="336" facs="0357"
                                xml:id="pg_336"/>of the forces of world exploitation—a chain which
                            ends in Washington.” With characteristic flair, <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> indicated that if he could not
                            persuade his people collectively to go down fighting, he would himself
                            become a Fedayeen and join the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. (S
                            NF)</p>
                        <p>The call for union with Syria and confrontation with the Arab right and
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> must be viewed in the context of
                            the past year, which by all accounts was a year of failure for the fiery
                            revolutionary who has hoped to assume the mantle of his idol Nasser. But
                            domestically, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s People’s
                            Revolution has fallen far short of his goals and he is faced with
                            growing dissidence within Libya. External events affecting <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> include: being pushed out of
                            the limelight by the Egyptian-Israeli peace negotiations and the Soviet
                            invasion of Afghanistan, the failure of Libya’s intervention in Uganda,
                            and the break with Fatah. (S NF)</p>
                        <p>Most painful for the intensely religious <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> was the shift of attention to Ayatollah
                            Khomeini, who generated a revolutionary fervor in Iran that <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had never approached in his own
                            efforts to create an Islamic republic. The hurt was compounded when
                            Khomeini rejected out of hand <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s offer of support. (S NF)</p>
                        <p>It is not an accident that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                            >Qadhafi</persName>’s rhetoric has a haunting resemblance to
                            Khomeini’s—especially in the quest for martyrdom and the need to
                            confront the United States, the embodiment of imperialist exploitation.
                            (S NF)</p>
                        <p>And just as Khomeini unified his people by identifying the outside enemy
                            as the source of Iran’s troubles and successfully involving Iran in a
                            confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, so too an
                            outside enemy would at once satisfy <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s psychological and political needs. (S NF)</p>
                        <p>Thus, the combination of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s
                            frustration and the model provided by Khomeini in Iran could well lead
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> to provoke a
                            confrontation in order to gain significance, rationalizing the cost of a
                            likely military defeat in terms of the Muslim value of martyrdom. This
                            is the dangerous portent in <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>’s call for death rather than submission. In
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s psychological
                            calculus, it is better to be involved in a losing confrontation than
                            face failure as a revolutionary leader and the humiliation of being
                            ignored. (S NF)</p>

                        <p>2. Ref A reported Sep 18 Washington Post account of Libyan interception
                            of and possible attack on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> RC–135 and
                            included guidance prepared for Department’s daily press briefing Sep 18.
                            Subsequent to dispatch of ref A, guidance and its use was modified (see
                            para 6 below).</p>
                        <p>3. Facts of incident: On Sep 16, an RC–135 aircraft flying a central
                            Mediterranean track within international airspace aborted its mission
                            and returned to Hellenikon based on indications that Libyan fighter
                            aircraft may have initiated hostile action against it. Available
                            evidence suggests that there may have been Libyan intent to engage the
                            RC–135 using air-to-air missiles. This incident is an example of
                            occasional harassment by Libyan fighter aircraft of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> reconnaissance aircraft flying in
                            international airspace which dates back to 1972.</p>
                        <p>4. FYI. The first serious incident occurred on March 21, 1973, when two
                            Libyan mirages fired upon an RC–130 operating out of Hellenikon.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">See <ref target="frus1969-76ve09p1#d8"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, vol. E–9,
                                    Part 1, Documents on North Africa, 1973–1976, Document
                                8</ref>.</note> The RC–130 was not hit, but evasive action resulted
                            in damage to aircraft and the declaration of an emergency as it
                            approached Hellenikon. This incident caused Greek officials to focus on
                            nature of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> flight operations at
                            Hellenikon and during subsequent 1975–77 DCA negotiations, the Greeks
                            demonstrated extreme sensitivity over reconnaissance activities at
                            Hellenikon and challenged <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> authority
                            for staging of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> reconnaissance
                            aircraft from there. A subsequent search by both parties never turned up
                            a written agreement or evidence of a verbal agreement specifically
                            authorizing <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> reconnaissance activities
                            at Hellenikon. This circumstance and Greek sensitivity resulted in our
                            agreement in the initialed but unsigned 1977 DCA to provide the Greeks
                            with a dols 3.5 million quid and allow Greek participation <pb n="338"
                                facs="0359" xml:id="pg_338"/>in reconnaissance ground activities at
                            Hellenikon in return for GOG authority for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> to continue to use the base for reconnaissance air
                            operations and ground activities. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>5. You will note that our press guidance does not mention that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> operates RC–135 aircraft out of
                            Hellenikon. While this is no secret, our intent was to avoid any press
                            focus on Hellenikon which could rekindle Greek sensitivities and cause
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> reconnaissance activities at
                            Hellenikon to become an issue again in the forthcoming negotiations on a
                            new DCA. We have not seen any additional articles in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> press nor have Department or <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> received any follow-on inquiries.
                            However, the Greek press, perhaps through reporters in Washington, could
                            still pick up on this one and raise questions in Athens. Should this
                            occur, we believe Embassy should be prepared to brief MOD Averoff and/or
                            senior <gloss target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> officials promptly. For this
                            purpose, you are authorized to draw on background in paragraph 3 above,
                            press guidance in paragraph 6 below, and the following additional
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> reconnaissance flights in the
                            Mediterranean are always conducted in international airspace well away
                            from the airspace of any country. (This was the case in all the
                            incidents mentioned above.)</p>
                        <p>—Such flights from several bases in the Mediterranean occur on virtually
                            a daily basis;</p>
                        <p>—Given this frequency, such an incident is, indeed, an infrequent
                            occurrence;</p>
                        <p>—The Libyan regime has conducted almost all of these occasional
                            interceptions.</p>
                        <p>In any discussion, you should stress need for your interlocutors to
                            maintain confidentiality of sensitive info re <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> ability to detect possible attack as described.</p>
                        <p>6. Modified press guidance, as used on Sep 18, follows:</p>
                        <p>“Q. What can you tell us about the Libyan attack on a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> reconnaissance flight as reported in the
                            Washington Post?</p>
                        <p>A. I have no comment on that story.</p>
                        <p>Q. What action are we taking in response to this attack?</p>
                        <p>A. The United States has no hostile intent toward Libya and we do not in
                            any way seek confrontation with that country. Nonetheless, we are
                            prepared to take all necessary steps to insure the safety of our
                            aircraft operating in international airspace.</p>
                        <p>Q. What steps?</p>
                        <p>A. I think the statement speaks for itself.”</p>
                        <p>7. For Rome. Should it be necessary to discuss the incident, you should
                            do so only with high-ranking officials whose discretion can be trusted,
                            following the guidance given in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 above.</p>

                            Government to the Libyan intimidation campaign earlier this year was
                            shot and seriously wounded in Colorado Tuesday in what looked like an
                            assassination attempt.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">Tuesday, October 14.
                                In telegram 277512 to multiple posts, October 18, the Department
                                reported on the attack on Faisal Zagallai, a Ph.D. candidate at
                                Colorado State University: “The assailant was a middle-aged male
                                Caucasian—probably American (exact description will be furnished to
                                overseas police authorities through appropriate channels). While the
                                assailant has not as yet been apprehended there is reason to suspect
                                that he was a hired ‛gun’ in the pay of Libyan authorities.”
                                (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                                D800496–0830)</note> The FBI has indications the gunman was hired by
                            Libyan authorities. While there have been no reported assassination
                            attempts since June, there is growing evidence the intimidation campaign
                            might be starting up again here and in Europe. We met with the FBI and
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> to assess the incident and our
                            response. As a result of the meeting, we plan to:</p>
                        <p>—mobilize greater surveillance of Libyans likely to have been
                            involved;</p>

                            strategy;</p>
                        <p>—consider a public information campaign;</p>
                        <p>—assess the possibility of deporting known militants.</p>
                        <p>We called in the head of the Libyan People’s Bureau today to warn him of
                            the consequences of an assassination campaign in the United States.

                            language broadcast (FBIS 102 of 18 October) was claiming that the attack
                            on the Libyan graduate student had been carried out by a member of the
                            “World Revolutionary Committee”. The report justified the attack on the
                            grounds that the student had become “an agent and spy for American
                            intelligence”.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to this statement from JANA the Department called in the
                            head of the Libyan People’s Bureau and gave him the following note:</p>
                        <p>Begin text: On October 17, 1980 the Jamahiriya News Agency (JANA), in an
                            English language program, broadcast at 1920 GMT, claimed that the
                            October 14 attack and serious wounding of Faisal Zagallai, a Libyan
                            graduate student at Colorado State University, was carried out by a
                            member of the “World Revolutionary Committee” and justified the attack
                            on the grounds that Zagallai “became an agent and spy for American
                            intelligence.” This claim by JANA is made despite the fact that earlier
                            in the day representatives of the People’s Committee had told officials
                            of the United States Department of State that the attack had been
                            carried out without the knowledge or approval of Libyan authorities and
                            expressed their own “regret and shock” over the incident. At this
                            meeting the State Department representatives, in the strongest terms,
                            made it clear just how seriously the United States Government regards
                            such an act. They made it clear also that any official involvement in
                            this attack either by the Libyan Government or those representing the
                            Libyan Government could have grave consequences for relations between
                            the United States and Libya.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State must now reiterate—in the clearest and most
                            unequivocal terms—how seriously it regards an attack of this <pb n="341"
                                facs="0362" xml:id="pg_341"/>nature carried out within the sovereign
                            territory of the United States. The clear disagreement between the JANA
                            account and the People’s Bureau account of this deplorable attack leaves
                            the Department no choice but to demand from the Jamahiriya a
                            comprehensive and definitive official explanation of this incident. In
                            view of the gravity of the issue, this official explanation is required
                            within 48 hours from the receipt of this note. End text.</p>
                        <p>4. On October 20 the Libyan People’s Bureau responded to the note
                            indicating that their response came from Tripoli and represented the
                            official position of the Jamahiriya;</p>
                        <p>—In the report in question the Libyan news service (JANA) did not reflect
                            the views of Libyan authorities—the media “does not make foreign
                            policy”.</p>
                        <p>—The Libyan Government and its officials had nothing to do with this
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>—The Libyan Government asks the United States Government to take full
                            responsibility for the safety of Libyan students in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>—In addition the Jamahiriya asks that the Colorado incident be fully
                            investigated and that the People’s Bureau be given a full report of the
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>5. The Department does not give this denial any real credibility and is
                            considering additional steps which may be necessary in response to this
                            incident. Addressees will be kept fully informed of any such measures.
                            You may draw upon the above points in briefing your host government.</p>

                            the following points:</p>
                        <p>—Libyan authorities have a great desire to see relations with the United
                            States improved and hope a new page can be turned.</p>
                        <p>—The Committee has already communicated the request for voluntary
                            departure to the students involved. Some students have already departed.
                            Others will be leaving at the end of the fall semester. Some, however,
                            wish to remain and the People’s Bureau claims it has no legal means of
                            compelling their departure.</p>
                        <p>—The People’s Committee member has resigned. He will leave when he
                            completes his degree work in December.</p>
                        <p>This is progress, but we will assess whether it effectively reduces the
                            possibility of renewed violence against Libyans living here or whether
                            we should take stronger measures. (C)</p>

                        <p>326043. Subject: Libyan Protest Over U.S. Military Maneuvers in
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>1. On November 26 Department received the following note from the Libyan
                            People’s Bureau:</p>
                        <p>Begin text: Quote: The People’s Bureau of the Socialist People’s Libyan
                            Arab Jamahiriya presents its compliments to the Department of State and
                            wishes to submit the following cable addressed to the American
                            Government, outlining the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya’s
                            position vis-a-vis the military maneuvers being conducted in Egypt by
                            United States’ forces. The text of the cable:</p>
                        <p>1. The Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya strongly protests the
                            military maneuvers being conducted by the U.S. forces on the Egyptian
                            soil, as well as the presence of these forces therein, for the fact
                            that, such military maneuvers and presence are taking place along the
                            eastern borders of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and as
                            such have a dangerous impact, and direct results on the safety and
                            security of the Libyan Arab people, and the territorial waters
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>2. The Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya views the violations of
                            Libya’s air space and territorial waters by U.S. military airplanes
                            taking part in the said maneuvers as provocations which we vehemently
                            reject, and which will be met by force if necessary. We interpret this
                            behavior of the American Government to be an escalation of the hostile
                            actions which the U.S. Government is conducting against the Libyan Arab
                            people.</p>
                        <p>3. The Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya further views these
                            military maneuvers, and the resultant violations of our air space and
                            territorial waters as a serious threat not only to the safety and
                            security of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya alone, but to
                            the safety, and the security of the areas as a whole.</p>
                        <p>4. The Office of Foreign Liaison draws the attention of the U.S.
                            Government to the dangerous and negative consequences resulting from the
                            escalation of these provocative, and hostile actions, and <pb n="344"
                                facs="0365" xml:id="pg_344"/>charges the U.S. Government with all
                            the responsibilities resulting from such actions.</p>
                        <p>5. In light of the above, the Office of Foreign Liaison demands that the
                            U.S. Government immediately work to stop these provocations, and
                            reiterates its position that the U.S. Government will be held solely
                            responsible for the deterioration of the area’s security, as a result of
                            these provocations. Unquote. End text.</p>
                        <p>2. In response on December 2 DAS <persName corresp="#p_DM_1"
                                >Draper</persName> called Libyan People’s Bureau Head <persName
                                corresp="#p_HA_2">Ali el-Houderi</persName> to the Department and
                            handed back the note as unacceptable. In doing so he made the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>—We have investigated the allegations made in that note and find they are
                            false. The note is irrelevant and tendentious and is therefore
                            returned.</p>
                        <p>—We wish, however, to emphasize just how thoroughly these charges were
                            investigated—right down to the local unit commander level. No violation
                            of Libyan territory or entry into areas claimed by Libya occurred during
                            the deployment of the U.S. forces to Egypt, during maneuvers in Egypt,
                            or during withdrawal from Egypt. The Rapid Deployment Force maneuver was
                            strictly a training exercise and the force was in Egypt with the full
                            concurrence of the Egyptian Govt.</p>
                        <p>—The tone of this note is also disturbing. When you returned from Tripoli
                            you indicated a desire on the part of the Jamahiriya to work for
                            improved relations. The tone of this note does not bear out this
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>—In the interest of frankness and understanding we want to make clear our
                            position on Libyan territory and on U.S. military maneuvers in the
                            region.</p>
                        <p>—The United States—and for that matter most other governments—does not
                            recognize Libya’s claim to a 32 degree 30 minute bay closing line for
                            the Gulf of Sidra.</p>
                        <p>—United States Air and Naval units carry out periodic training exercises
                            in the section of the Mediterranean north of the Libyan coast. From time
                            to time these units cross the 32 degree 30 minute line. Libya must
                            understand that the United States and the majority of the nations of the
                            world regard this area as “high seas”.</p>
                        <p>—From time to time Libyan units have intercepted U.S. aircraft over the
                            Mediterranean. Occasionally these aircraft were south of Libya’s
                            unrecognized 32 degree 30 minute line. On most occasions, however, the
                            aircraft were well out beyond such a line. In all cases the aircraft
                            were operating in what is regarded as international airspace. During
                            these intercepts, Libyan aircraft have from time to time given some
                            indications of hostile intent. We in no way seek confrontation with
                            Libya over this but we will of course protect our aircraft.</p>
                        <p>—The United States has fully participated in the Law of the Seas
                            negotiations and subject to Senate confirmation (just as Libya’s
                                agree<pb n="345" facs="0366" xml:id="pg_345"/>ment would be subject
                            to General People’s Congress confirmation) we are prepared to join with
                            the rest of the world in setting agreed upon standards for the
                            recognition of territorial waters. The Libyan <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> Mission will confirm, however, that Libya’s claims to
                            rights over the Gulf of Sidra as a historic bay and of the bay closing
                            line at 32 degrees 30 minutes are not reflected in the draft
                            convention.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, Libya should understand that these exercises and maneuvers in
                            no way represent a hostile intent toward Libya nor are they meant to be
                            provocative in any way. We understand, for example, Libya’s concern over
                            the area near the Egyptian border. We have told you privately and have
                            stated publicly that the United States Government urges both Egypt and
                            Libya to exercise maximum restraint along that border. Our policy in
                            this regard has not changed.</p>
                        <p>—Our naval exercises, our flights in this region, will continue. At no
                            point will they violate territory which the rest of the world recognizes
                            as forming a part of the Jamahiriya. From time to time such units will
                            cross the 32 degree 30 minute line—but not with hostile intent.</p>
                        <p>3. In reply <persName corresp="#p_HA_2">el-Houderi</persName> indicated
                            that the violations of territory referred to in the note may not
                            necessarily have occurred during the maneuvering in Egypt but that “some
                            violations have occurred”. He defended the reference to the use of force
                            as “a matter of principle” to which every country had a right in defense
                            of its territory. He emphasized that the note, while reflecting the
                            views of Libya’s leaders, was not meant to “search for trouble” and that
                            Libya also wished to avoid incidents. As often before, he expressed the
                            hope that the U.S. and Libya could get beyond such problems and
                            establish more cordial relations.</p>
                        <p>4. On another subject <persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Draper</persName>
                            raised the status of the Libyan students asked by the Department to
                            leave the United States. (FYI: In response to increased activity of
                            Libyan revolutionary committees in the Libyan student community in the
                            United States the Department has asked the People’s Bureau to arrange
                            for the voluntary departure of 19 Libyan students from the United
                            States. These students are among those most active in such committees.
                            The People’s Bureau has told the Department that some of those students
                            are already in the process of departing, but evidence available to us
                            does not bear this out. End FYI). <persName corresp="#p_HA_2"
                                >El-Houderi</persName> agreed to furnish the Department with a

                        <p>2. Department noted with considerable interest British expression of
                            willingness to coordinate response to the renewal of the Libyan
                            assassination campaign (ref A).</p>

                                    <ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>.</note> the FBI continues
                            to investigate but has not yet established a definite link to Libyan
                            authorities. Nonetheless, nothing has emerged from that investigation
                            which would alter the original assumption that the Colorado shooting was
                            politically motivated.</p>
                        <p>4. We have warned the Libyans that any confirmation of official
                            involvement in this shooting or any repetition of such an incident would
                            have serious consequences for U.S./Libyan relations. In addition, we
                            have asked the Libyans—voluntarily—to arrange for the departure from the
                            United States of 19 students and one member of the People’s Committee of
                            the People’s Bureau. The students are among the most active leaders of
                            the revolutionary committees, twenty-two of which have been identified
                            across the U.S. The People’s Committee member was the People’s Bureau
                            link to these committees. To date there is no indication that these
                            people have made any effort to leave the U.S. Voluntary departure is the
                            only avenue for quick removal of the students from the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>; an attempt to deport them would involve
                            full appeal rights under <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> laws and
                            could take up to three years.</p>
                        <p>5. We have requested the People’s Bureau (ref D) to give us an update on
                            the status of those asked to leave and will assess where we go next upon
                            receipt of the Bureau’s response.</p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_347"/>
                        <p>6. For info addressees: You may draw upon paras 3–5 if you deem it
                            appropriate to brief your host government.</p>
                        <p>7. For London: You may draw on paras 2–5 in briefing FCO and, as well,
                            inform FCO of action we took re recent Libyan note (ref D). The
                            Department will keep both the FCO and the British Embassy in Washington
                            fully informed on this subject. In addition, the Department is quite
                            willing to hold exploratory talks on coordination with FCO at the
                            appropriate time (para 4 ref A). We are also quite interested in Oliver
                            Miles’ idea for a joint <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>–EC statement.
                            On this we would look to FCO for advice on how best to work out the
                            modalities for such a statement but would be fully prepared to
                            cooperate. Department remains convinced that this assassination threat
                            is one which affects equally the United States and our European allies
                            and that joint action of this sort could ultimately be one of the most
                            effective approaches for dealing with this challenge.</p>

                            not be authorized at this facility;</p>
                        <p>d. instructed Air Force not to pursue further its proposal to establish
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAC_1"
                                >MAC</gloss> facilities in Morocco; and</p>
                        <p>e. informed Navy that we do not consider it propitious to seek King

                            Moroccan beaches for fleet amphibious training.</p>
                        <p>(S) I also have asked Air Force to incorporate an air-to-ground training
                            option as an adjunct to the weapons training center plans, as this could
                            prove an attractive inducement for the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> to accept the joint training facility. The
                            air-to-ground function would involve the use of small inert bombs and
                            require only a modest dedicated ground area and relatively little air
                            space. The facility would give the Moroccans <pb n="349" facs="0370"
                                xml:id="pg_349"/>a highly valuable practice bombing range, as well

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss> has determined that the naval
                            communications facilities in Morocco are no longer required for support
                            of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military forces. These
                            communications functions have been superseded by satellite capabilities
                            and alternative installations in the Mediterranean area. Navy is anxious
                            to close these facilities, and has prepared a schedule of gradual
                            withdrawal from now until the end of <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                            78. This lengthy process has been designed to minimize the economic
                            impact on the Moroccan workers currently employed at the facilities and
                            was worked out on the basis of close consultations with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> in Rabat. At
                            present, the facilities are maintained in an active status but are not
                            being used.</p>
                        <p>A proposal to notify King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            of our intent to close this facility was submitted to Secretary
                            Kissinger in December 1976.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">Not
                                found.</note> He was concerned that the closure of these facilities
                            (and the consequent closure <pb n="350" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_350"/>of
                            the small communications training school attached to them) would signal
                            a lessening of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> support for Morocco.
                            This concern had been recognized earlier, and Defense had been asked to
                            prepare a list of possible alternative military facilities or
                            installations which could be discussed with the King at the same time he
                            was notified of our impending withdrawal of the communications station
                            and communications school.</p>
                        <p>Defense presented a list of possible alternative sites and facilities
                            which could be proposed to the King, including (in ascending order of

                                target="#t_MAC_1">MAC</gloss> facility represent a considerably
                            greater <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> military presence than would
                            be practical or desirable at this time. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> has asked that the
                            Communications School be maintained if at all possible, and State may
                            raise with Defense the feasibility of retaining the school in some form
                            (or possibly replacing it by training programs in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>) as a means of cushioning the effect of
                            the base closure.</p>
                        <p>We concur fully with the State position, and we believe that this
                            situation is well in hand and on the way to a satisfactory solution.
                            However, we would naturally wish to monitor the follow-through and
                            implementation, particularly with respect to the Communications School.
                            The Moroccan base issue was studied in some depth by an interagency
                            group last fall,<note n="5" xml:id="d146fn5">See <ref
                                    target="frus1969-76ve09p1#d85"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            Department letter is fully consistent with the findings of that group.
                            Further study would be possible, but the real effect of another
                            interagency review would be to delay the termination of an overseas
                            military facility for which we have no further need. Nor do we want to
                            encourage the bureaucracy to think about a highly visible military
                            presence in Morocco. We can find many other ways to keep <gloss

                        <p>1. You are authorized to utilize February 12 audience with King <persName

                            terms our intent with respect both to phasedown of Kenitra and
                            installation of GEODSS station in Morocco. Note that, as <persName

                            improvements have rendered our facilities at Kenitra unnecessary and
                            that is the sole reason for our decision to close them. You should couch
                            GEODSS proposal in terms that underscore <gloss target="#t_US_1"

                        <p>2. Tell King that you have not yet received detailed descriptions of
                            either proposal but that you expect to be able to present them to His
                            Majesty at an audience which you will request after your return from
                            Amman. Request King’s preliminary reaction to your generalized approach

                            address specifics in absence of detailed proposals.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to possible visit by <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to U.S., you should tell him you have been
                            assured the new administration is aware of his interest. Given many
                            Chiefs of State who have expressed similar interest, need to focus
                            initially on Middle East leaders directly involved in helping get

                            fronts. We are sure King will understand why it has not yet been

                            administration.</p>

                        <p>1. During hour-long February 14 meeting alone with the King, I made the

                        <p>2. The King said he understood perfectly reason for eventual phaseout of
                            Kenitra complex, appreciated the spirit behind our GEODSS proposal, and
                            indicated he would welcome this facility.<note n="4" xml:id="d148fn4">An

                            the U.S. had no Mediterranean facilities for its nuclear powered
                            submarines, and only had Tunisia where they could resupply on the
                            southern littoral. <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> said
                            he had told Clements on an “ultra secret” basis that he would be willing
                            to receive American experts to look into the possibility of establishing
                            bases for nuclear submarines along Morocco’s Mediterranean coast in “one

                            there were many protected areas along this coast which would be ideal
                            for such <pb n="354" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_354"/>facilities. The King
                            said he wished me to reiterate to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> his willingness to discuss this question, adding
                            that he did not exclude the possibility that the U.S. and Morocco might
                            be able to reach agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. As he had throughout the conversation, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> repeated that he and his country were firmly
                            opposed to Communism, that “the Soviets are my enemy”, and that he
                            wished to help the U.S. in any way he could. He had earlier gone on at
                            some length about how the U.S. should “use” Morocco and its unique
                            position in Africa to help stop Soviet encroachments. He displayed a
                            particular sensitivity on the question of Libya, which he charged was
                            the Soviet Union’s arsenal for future subversion in Africa.</p>
                        <p>4. As a seeming afterthought, the King said that while new technology may
                            have made our communications facilities in Morocco obsolete, he recalled
                            reading recently that U.S. communications satellites might be vulnerable
                            to Soviet attack. Speaking for himself, he said that he always sought to
                            leave himself more than one escape hatch and suggested the U.S. might
                            want to consider retaining a part of what it already had just in
                            case.</p>
                        <p>5. I suggested that we maintain strict confidentiality on this subject to
                            avoid giving any wrong impressions as the scenario developed. He
                            wholeheartedly agreed. I said I would request a further audience when I
                            received detailed description on the Kenitra phaseout and on GEODSS. He
                            said he looked forward to seeing me after Amman.</p>
                        <p>6. Comment: King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s
                            preliminary reaction to both Kenitra and GEODSS was positive. I
                            interpret this initial conversation as reflecting the King’s
                            understanding of our position and his willingness to cooperate with us.
                            We should be able to proceed without any fundamental damage to our
                            excellent relations provided we implement our plans with full
                            sensitivity to Moroccan concerns.</p>

                            unnecessary. Consequently the Navy will begin to phase down these
                            facilities on 1 June 1977 and the process will be complete by 30
                            September 1978.<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">An unknown hand underlined

                        <p>3. We expect to return use of the land at Sidi Yahia to the Government of
                            Morocco by 31 December 1977 while the land at Bouknadel and the land and
                            facilities at Kenitra will be relinquished by 30 September 1978.</p>
                        <p>4. We would expect in the future to enter more formal discussions with
                            the Government of Morocco to determine which buildings and facilities at
                            Sidi Yahia and Bouknadel will be left in place and transferred to
                            Moroccan ownership. Within statutory limits and procedures <pb n="356"
                                facs="0377" xml:id="pg_356"/>and with the exception of some unique
                            items, we intend to offer to Morocco, at minimum cost, certain items of
                            equipment and materiel, including some communications equipment and
                            associated antennae as well as about 400 family housing units. Navy
                            records indicate more than 600 permanent or semi-permanent buildings at
                            the three sites have a total value of approximately dollars 59 million.
                            (FYI: Term “at minimum cost” could mean anything from market value to
                            free of charge. End FYI.)</p>
                        <p>5. Moroccan employees hired through the Moroccan Office of
                            Administration, whose annual salaries total about dollars 2 million,
                            will receive severance pay in accordance with the existing labor
                            contract. The plan is to release the 113 Moroccan employees at Sidi
                            Yahia and 30 of the Moroccan employees at Bouknadel during the period
                            October–December 1977. The remaining 15 Moroccan employees at Bouknadel
                            and all 361 Moroccan employees at Kenitra will be released during the
                            period January–September 1978.</p>
                        <p>6. Some 130 Moroccan employees are paid from non-appropriated funds such
                            as those generated by recreational activities and clubs and their
                            positions will be terminated in keeping with the rate of reduction of
                            available non-appropriated funds which will result from the departure of
                            American personnel.</p>
                        <p>7. According to initial estimates, severance pay for all Moroccan
                            employees will total approximately dollars 2 million while accrued
                            annual leave payments will add dollars 500 thousand more. Also, we will
                            help set up a cooperative program with labor unions and local community
                            organizations to aid in placing Moroccan employees in new jobs.</p>
                        <p>8. After 1 June 1978, funds will not be available to continue operation
                            and maintenance of the base at Kenitra and for the remainder of the

                        <p>10. Proposal for establishment of ground-based electro-optical deep space
                            surveillance (GEODSS) system in Morocco. Moroccan geography and climate
                            provide favorable conditions for establishment of a GEODSS site which
                            would become part of a global network of similar sites supporting
                            passive monitoring of objects in very high-altitude <pb n="357"
                                facs="0378" xml:id="pg_357"/>earth orbit. This effort will support
                            the mission of SpaceTrack which maintains a continuous daily accounting
                            of all space objects.</p>
                        <p>11. The GEODSS station will consist of as many as four 20–30 inch
                            aperture telescopes, low light level TV cameras, digital computers,
                            control consoles and communications equipment. It will be operated and
                            maintained by <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> civilian contractor
                            personnel, sponsored by the Department of Defense and perhaps augmented
                            by as many as five <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Air Force
                            personnel, in the numbers listed below for each phase of the project.
                            Construction—12 men, installation and checkout—15 men, normal
                            operation—40–50 men.<note n="5" xml:id="d149fn5">An unknown hand
                                highlighted the last two sentences of this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <p>12. The station is designed so that a major portion of it, primarily the
                            technical equipment, could be disassembled and removed within two weeks.
                            To house this equipment it will be necessary to build a structure with
                            10,000 square feet of floor space and four exterior domes for the
                            telescopes. If approved by the Government of Morocco, construction would
                            begin in the last quarter of calendar year 1978 and would entail maximum
                            use of local labor and materials. While the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> will bear all establishment and operating costs we would
                            hope that the Government of Morocco would provide the necessary land
                            free of rent or other charge.<note n="6" xml:id="d149fn6">An unknown
                                hand highlighted this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <p>13. It is hoped that GEODSS can be installed within an existing Moroccan
                            facility so that its identification with the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> would not be emphasized. In this regard, assuming no
                            additional cost to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, Moroccan
                            scientists and officials would be welcomed and could have access to the
                            facility for collection of data on stars, planets and other celestial
                            objects including scientific or geodetic satellites. In addition, the
                            Government of Morocco can be provided data collected during
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>14. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will seek radio communications
                            for the GEODSS site and submit entrance requirements for all Defense
                            Department personnel and aircraft through normal channels.</p>
                        <p>15. Based on earlier generous agreement in principle of His Majesty King

                        <p>16. FYI: (Not for discussion with <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"

                            should be raised by media representatives. No formal public announcement
                            is planned either for GEODSS or Kenitra except for statements to be

                            Following press guidance to be used only after clearance by King

                            guidance:</p>
                        <p>Q. Is it true that we are closing our base in Morocco?</p>
                        <p>A. We have not had “bases” in Morocco since the early 60’s when we
                            evacuated our <gloss target="#t_SAC_1">SAC</gloss> sites at the request
                            of King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan II</persName>. We have
                            maintained a small naval communications facility and supporting training
                            command in Morocco, but advances in technology make these facilities no
                            longer necessary. We are closing them in the context of overall programs
                            aimed at saving money and redistributing personnel to areas of greater
                            need. We will begin a gradual closing of the facilities 1 June 1977 and
                            they will be completely shut down by September 30, 1978.</p>
                        <p>Q. Are we replacing the current facilities with any other kinds of
                            “facilities?”</p>
                        <p>A. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has very
                            generously granted permission for the U.S. to locate a satellite
                            tracking station in Morocco. This station has nothing to do with the
                            closing of Kenitra. This would be a largely civilian-manned facility
                            with about 45–50 persons possibly including five U.S. Air Force
                            personnel. Naturally the scientific information it generates would be
                            made available to the Moroccan Government and Moroccan scientists would
                            be welcome to use the telescopes for their own scientific inquiry if
                            they wished to do so.</p>
                        <p>Q. This appears to be a cutback. Does it signal some kind of chill in our
                            relations with Morocco?</p>
                        <p>A. Definitely not. We have had friendly relations with Morocco for 200
                            years and they are especially close right now. No one should read into
                            this any indication that our relationship with Morocco is anything but
                            warm, cooperative and based on mutual respect. This change is being made
                            in full consultation with the Moroccan Government.</p>
                        <p>Q. Do we have plans for other installations on Moroccan soil?</p>
                        <p>A. No. Were we to see any such need in the future, naturally we would
                            consult with Congress, as we are in this case, and seek agreement with
                            the Moroccan Government. End text.</p>

                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and Moroccan Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> met with
                            departing Moroccan Ambassador Abdelhadi Boutaleb Friday, April 15, at
                            3:00 p.m. Also present was Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_AAL_1">Atherton</persName>. Conversation dealt with four
                            subjects: Zaire, Southern Africa, Western Sahara and Middle East.</p>
                        <p>2. Zaire: Boutaleb stated Moroccan forces in Zaire in response to Zairian
                            appeal addressed to Morocco and other countries to uphold principle of
                            territorial integrity. Morocco intervened in part because appeal was
                            made directly by Zaire Foreign Minister, but principally because it was
                            also addressed through <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and it was
                            through <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> decided to respond. Other African
                            countries, including Egypt and Sudan, are considering providing
                            assistance. Morocco was pleased to note April 15 statement of acting
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> President expressing support
                            for Zaire position and approval of aid given Kinshasa government by
                            other African countries. Morocco sees Katangan invasion of Zaire
                            developing within framework built by African tours of Soviet President
                            Podgorny and Cuban Premier Castro. Latter also visited Algeria twice
                            before going on to East Germany and Moscow, and <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> perceives certain parallels between Soviet and Cuban
                            backing of invasion of Zaire and troubles in Sahara. Morocco understands
                            reasons why U.S. does not wish insert itself directly into Zaire
                            conflict and feels that Moroccan intervention in Zaire, in support of
                            ideals shared with U.S. and in keeping with Moroccan duty as African
                            state, entitles Morocco to expect and demand more American support and
                                understanding.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">An unknown hand placed a

                            Therefore, irresponsible and sometimes even responsible American voices
                            justifying Soviet and Cuban intervention in Africa hard to
                                understand.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">An unknown hand highlighted
                                and placed a checkmark next to this sentence.</note></p>
                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> replied that
                            Moroccan action in Zaire is an example of African cooperation and may
                            serve as catalyst for stability <pb n="361" facs="0382" xml:id="pg_361"
                            />helping to ensure success of attempts to negotiate solution. In terms
                            of Soviet and Cuban actions, Secretary noted he has spoken to Russians
                            several times, as recently as April 15, on dangers of intervention in
                            Africa. U.S. urged Russians, their friends and colleagues, to avoid
                            expanding scope of problem. Believe substance and import of message was
                            understood but we will be watching carefully for results.</p>
                        <p>4. Southern Africa: Secretary volunteered background on current Owen
                            Mission noting it stems from prior U.S.–U.K. agreement to attempt to
                            convene a constitutional conference which would include all nationalist
                            leaders, Front Line African states, Rhodesia and South Africa. U.S.
                            would participate as co-convener if other parties so desired. Should
                            constitutional conference succeed, British Parliament would then pass
                            enabling legislation to be followed by three to six month transitional
                            period, under rule of a British Governor General with order secured by
                            Commonwealth troups, during which time preparation would be made for a
                            referendum. U.S. direct involvement stems from concern that only broad
                            positive action could head off renewal of fighting which would provide
                            greater opportunities for Soviet penetration and radicalization of
                            region.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador Boutaleb described U.S. actions as timely and assured
                            Secretary that Morocco will consistently support all U.S. initiatives
                            for peace in Africa and Middle East.</p>
                        <p>6. Western Sahara: Boutaleb described Moroccan activity in Sahara as
                            prompted by concerns for territorial integrity, peace and stability, and
                            contrasted Moroccan intentions in conflict with destabilizing designs of
                            “our antagonist”. Boutaleb noted that Moroccan portion of Sahara
                            entirely under control, which prompts Algerians to attack weaker
                            Mauritania. He also commented that Moroccan Sahara policy enjoys support
                            of most of Arab League and <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> except
                            for those countries which side with external forces for instability in
                            Africa. Boutaleb expressed appreciation for past U.S. understanding and
                            support, particularly our favorable vote in 1975 UNGA.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d150fn4">Reference is to UNGA Resolution 3458B, adopted on
                                December 10, 1975, which supported the Morocco Accords, the
                                tripartite agreement between Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania, and the
                                right of the Saharan people to self-determination. For text of the

                                    1975</hi>, pp. 189–190.</note> He noted that Morocco has often
                            voted in support of U.S. interests. Morocco regards Sahara issue as
                            closed, but looks forward to receiving support and understanding,
                            especially from U.S., should necessity arise.</p>
                        <p>7. Referring to irresponsible statements by Americans on foreign policy
                            matters, Moroccan Ambassador noted remarks by delegation of Black
                            Americans in Algeria which met with Polisario leaders and made statement
                            accusing Morocco of genocide in the Sahara. Boutaleb, <pb n="362"
                                facs="0383" xml:id="pg_362"/>slightly agitated, described delegation
                            statement as incoherent and ignorant.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary stated delegation has no connection with <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> and was not reflecting U.S. national
                            policy. Boutaleb agreed with Secretary’s statement that, as few
                            Americans likely ever to have heard of delegation or its spokesperson,
                            less said about the incident the better.</p>
                        <p>9. Regarding Sahara, Secretary noted U.S. understanding of situation and
                            sympathetic consideration of Moroccan standpoint while reaffirming that
                            U.S. remains neutral on substance of issue. Secretary requested
                            Moroccans keep us informed of future developments.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d150fn5">An unknown hand placed a checkmark next to this
                                sentence.</note></p>
                        <p>10. On Middle East Boutaleb described Moroccan position as consistently
                            moderate and counseling moderation with other Chiefs of State and with
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. Morocco has encouraged parties
                            to accept Resolutions 242 and 338<note n="6" xml:id="d150fn6">See <ref
                                    target="#d59fn3">footnote 3, Document 59</ref>.</note> and
                            strongly supports all U.S. efforts to achieve just and lasting peace in
                            the Middle East in interest of all concerned. Morocco does not recognize
                            right to acquire territory by force, but if states concerned should
                            decide to cede some portion of their territory, Morocco would not
                                object.<note n="7" xml:id="d150fn7">An unknown hand wrote in the

                            Morocco does not shirk its duties as Arab state; King <persName

                            Secretary, Boutaleb stated that Geneva Conference must be well prepared
                            in advance in order to succeed and that present comings and goings of
                            area leaders represent, in effect, beginning of the Geneva Conference.
                            When it meets, conference should simply ratify agreements reached

                            stated that it would be inconsistent with Moroccan policy elsewhere to
                            support referendums when they conflict with principle of territorial

                        <p>11. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for Moroccan support for U.S. peace efforts and noted
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s commitment to
                            bring concerned parties together in 1977. Secretary described meetings

                            deep friendship that binds us, and we have been particularly pleased by
                            the constructive role that Morocco has played on behalf of peace in the
                            Middle East. His Majesty has shown courage, knowledge, and has earned

                                Middle East peace process.” (Carter Library, National Security
                                Affairs, Brzezinski Material, Country File, Box 55, Morocco:
                                1/77–12/78)</note> He hesitated before requesting this, because he
                            attached great importance to the visit and he had been preparing himself
                            carefully. It is difficult to give you the reasons for his decision, but
                            there were two basic concerns: First, his preoccupation with the
                            situation in the region. There has been no spectacular new element, but
                            recently he did see the President of Mauritania, Ould Daddah. As you
                            know, Morocco is tied to Mauritania by a defense pact, and we have just
                            decided to send an important number of troops to Mauritania. They are
                            now being sent and His Majesty felt that he should stay in Morocco to
                            supervise personally this move. Secondly, His Majesty is preoccupied by
                            the situation in the Middle East and by the cleavage that is emerging
                            between the peace camp and the rejection front. The President knows of
                            the contacts that Morocco has taken to facilitate communications between
                            the interested parties and I can give you more details on this
                            later.</p>
                        <p>This is the object of my mission, and if you have some time I would be
                            happy to discuss some of the problems in our bilateral relations, in the
                            situation in North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> Please relay to His Majesty my complete
                            understanding of his decision. The need for change in plans is something
                            that I can understand. I had also planned a trip, but domestic problems
                            caused me to delay it. Also please relay my regret, and my determination
                            that in the near future we will have the chance to meet personally and
                            discuss matters of mutual concern. One of the reasons I consider his
                            decision to be easily understandable is that there are no urgent
                            differences between us that require immediate consultations. He has
                            reconfirmed his friendship for our country by sending you. The fact that
                            the King asked you to come to convey his message is a sign of his
                            concern and I appreciate it. We have time for a brief summary of the
                            situation in Northwest Africa and other matters, and we will have some
                            time to consult more extensively with Secretary <persName

                            your views on developments in your own region and in the Middle
                            East.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prime Minister:</hi> The President’s words will be
                            welcome to His Majesty. His Majesty is very embarrassed and he does want
                            the visit to take place. I won’t take long, but I do want to say a few
                            words about the situation in North Africa. We are having difficulties
                            with Algeria. We consider that the problem is not one of territory or
                            the conflict over the Sahara. Algeria says that it has no territorial
                            claims. We consider that we are involved in a plan that goes beyond
                            Algeria and involves foreign intervention in Africa. There is an axis
                            from Moscow through Algeria and Havana, and Angola was part of this
                            operation. We have seen the example of what happened in Shaba. Algeria
                            is a pawn in this and is part of a vast machination. We think that in
                            the last few months the African countries have come to see this
                            conspiracy. Algeria’s neighbors, Mali, Niger, and Chad, have come to
                            understand the dangers and they have the same analysis as we do. We want
                            the United States to be aware of this.</p>
                        <p>Our action in Shaba encouraged these other countries. It showed that an
                            African country, though it is far away and is white, would come to the
                            aid of another African country. Africans want to protect their
                            independence, and they want at least moral aid from outside. Concerning
                            the Sahara conflict, there has been little change. It is guerrilla
                            warfare of the hit and run variety. But the situation in Mauritania has
                            become dangerous. The Polisario is only a name and in fact it is Algeria
                            that is behind this conflict. We are seeing increasingly sophisticated
                            arms, and Algeria is now attacking Mauritania. Very recently Ould Daddah
                            visited Morocco, and, as part of our common defense agreement, he asked
                            Morocco to occupy several Mauritanian positions. It has been decided
                            that Morocco will respond. We hope that this will deter the
                            Algerians.</p>
                        <p>We have been receiving all mediators, but this has never led anywhere. We
                            have not lost hope. We hope that Algeria will again become
                            reasonable.</p>
                        <p>Algeria is now pursuing an ideological war. There is an ideological
                            cleavage between the so-called progressive, and it is worth considering
                            whether this word is appropriate, but the Algerians want to accentuate
                            the left versus right difference. There is a risk of escalation in the
                            Middle East over this issue and it could spread to the Sahara. This is
                            the situation in North Africa. We hope for American help, and we want
                            moral support first of all. We also want diplomatic support. This will
                            help us enormously. We see ourselves as all being in the same boat and
                            all confronting the same dangers.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">President:</hi> I recognize the threat that comes from
                            the Soviet Union, Cuba and Algeria to peace in Africa. We have tried to
                            express our concern over the Cuban presence in Africa, which has been
                            supported by the Soviet Union. Anything that Morocco can do to build
                            public <pb n="366" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_366"/>concern in Africa
                            against the Cuban position would be of great help. We also have a deep
                            concern over Algeria’s attitude which is an obstacle to harmony in the
                            Middle East and North Africa. I want to continue the closest
                            consultations with King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>.
                            I would like to be kept informed of Morocco’s needs. We have a clear
                            expression of the Moroccan role in the Shaba-Zaire conflict. It was an
                            inspiration to us all. It reaffirmed for African leaders the belief that
                            borders should not be changed by force. If you permit, I would like to
                            write a personal note to King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> about his decision to cancel his visit.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Prime Minister:</hi> We saw, before the King’s

                            that the Algerians would attack and then retreat to Tindouf. We have
                            increasingly been seeing the use of sophisticated arms. We don’t expect
                            a full war. If Algeria is objective, they have no reason for a war.
                            Algerian opinion is not engaged over the Sahara issue. Maybe if Tindouf
                            were involved, but not the Sahara. Algerian soldiers are not motivated.
                            And no one would win such a war. Its outcome would be uncertain.
                            Therefore, objectively, Algeria should be deterred. We hope they will be
                            deterred. We have everything to lose in such a war. Morocco wants to
                            develop its economy and we think that the recent democratization in
                            Morocco will allow the full flowering of our economic growth. This
                            deters us from wanting war.</p>

                            there would be a major confrontation with key groups in Congress and no
                            guarantee of success should we decide to accede to the Moroccan request.
                            Chairman Diggs of the HIRC Subcommittee on Africa and Dick Clarke, his
                            counterpart in the SFRC, are both firmly opposed, as is <persName

                            despite a generally sympathetic attitude toward Morocco. I fear there is
                            a chance such a resolution would be approved, given sentiment against
                            transfers of U.S. arms to Africa and concerns related to
                            self-determination. A major complicating factor in coming months will be
                            the controversy over major aircraft sales, such as F–15’s for Saudi
                            Arabia and F–5’s for Egypt. There could be a backlash in this situation
                            which we fear would focus on Moroccan use of U.S. arms in the Sahara,
                            increasing the chances for disapproval.</p>
                        <p>2. Under the circumstances, I have decided not repeat not to submit the
                            arms request to the Congress at this time. We will, of course, wish to
                            continue our traditional military assistance relationship under the

                            stated to you that this particular arms request is only an element in
                            our overall relations and what is really important is Moroccan
                            confidence in the strength of American sympathy and political

                            take our cue from Osman’s comments in our discussions with Moroccans on
                            this subject. We should emphasize the positive, noting our support and
                            sympathy for Morocco, our determination to continue to support Morocco’s
                            modernization program, etc.</p>

                            problems, we have held informal consultations with the Congress. I

                        <p>5. The following are talking points which, with the exception of the
                            first, you may use at your discretion when transmitting my letter:</p>
                        <p>—(Obligatory talking point) the terms of the military assistance
                            agreement between the U.S. and Morocco restrict the use of equipment
                            furnished under its provisions to the defense of the territory of the
                            Kingdom of Morocco recognized by the United States. This area does not
                            include that portion of the Western Sahara now under Morocco’s
                            administrative control. Nor does the agreement authorize Moroccan use in
                            other nations of equipment furnished by the U.S. Government.</p>
                        <p>—Our congressional consultations revealed strong opposition to the arms
                            proposal, hearings were scheduled by critics of Morocco, and we were
                            informed that a motion of disapproval would have been introduced had we
                            proceeded with the sale of the OV–10 or Cobra helicopters.</p>
                        <p>—Our consultations coincided with administration efforts to obtain
                            congressional support for the sale of aircraft to Saudi Arabia and
                            Egypt. In view of the importance of these sales to the prospects for
                            peace in the Middle East, and taking into consideration congressional
                            opposition to any expansion of U.S. arms sales to African and Middle
                            Eastern nations, the administration decided this would be an
                            inappropriate time to press the Moroccan arms request.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. is more actively pursuing the search for a peaceful settlement
                            to the dispute over the Western Sahara and urged African governments to
                            attend the March summit conference on the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>6. Department will be informing Congress of this decision. We will employ
                            following talking points in framing press guidance and suggest you do
                            also:</p>
                        <p>—Our relations with Morocco are excellent and have been animated by close
                            cooperation for many years.</p>
                        <p>—Our decision against authorizing sale at this time of the desired arms
                            should not be interpreted as indicating any change in our friendly
                            relations with Morocco.</p>
                        <p>—This decision does not alter our existing arms supply arrangements with
                            Morocco conducted under the terms of our bilateral accord.</p>
                        <p>—As far as the Sahara dispute is concerned, the U.S. position remains one
                            of neutrality and advocacy of a peaceful settlement.</p>

                            recalled that <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> National Defense
                            Administration had already been informed of our new request to Congress

                        <p>3. In the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>’s view, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> continued, the negative
                            reaction facing the September 1977 Moroccan arms request<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d154fn5">See <ref target="#d152fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    152</ref>.</note> did not lie in Congress, but rather in the
                            Department of State. I responded that I had understood this was the view
                            of Moroccan Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                            >Bengelloun</persName>, but that in my view, this was not correct. I
                            then reviewed (a) <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>’s
                            conversation with the Secretary last November that the arms request
                            posed problems for <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d154fn6">See <ref target="#d216">Document 216</ref>.</note>
                            (b) the subsequent decision to consult informally with the Congress and
                            (c) finally the change in jurisdiction in January of consideration of
                            the arms request from the Middle East Subcommittee to the African
                            Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses, with
                            the leadership of the latter being critical of the request. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> acknowledged that the problem
                            was probably more complicated than he realized. My guess is that until
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> faces the
                            realities of the role and attitudes of Congress and faithfully reports
                            same to his government, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            will remain skeptical of the inability of the Executive Branch to carry
                            out a policy which he believes is clearly in the U.S. as well as the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> interests.</p>
                        <p>4. I next recalled that in a brief discussion with Royal Counselor
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> on February 25
                            before leaving for COM meeting in Tunis, he had asked me about the
                            status of the Moroccan arms request.<note n="7" xml:id="d154fn7">Not
                                found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said he was aware of the
                            conversation when I had told <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1"
                                >Guedira</persName> I had no precise information but sensed there
                            were problems in the Congress. Now I had a private letter from the
                            Secretary to the FonMinister on the subject.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> then read the
                            Secretary’s letter aloud in French, commenting that the U.S. decision
                            was “really regrettable”. Regarding the phrases “at the present time”
                            and “our present inability”, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> said with some feeling that the problem was
                            urgent as Morocco needed the arms now to face up to the increasingly
                            serious threat from outside.</p>
                        <p>6. I went on to cover in full obligatory first talking point para 5
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> (A), stressing that,
                            apart from Morocco’s September arms request per se, under the terms of
                            our 1960 agreement the arms provided by the U.S. were for use solely in
                            Morocco, not in the Sahara or Mauritania. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> said he fully understood the terms of the
                            agreement, and once again noted that our definition and that of his
                            government differed as to the confines of the Kingdom of Morocco.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said he looked
                            forward to discussing this question further with the Secretary on March
                                11.<note n="8" xml:id="d154fn8">See <ref target="#d223">Document
                                    223</ref>.</note> I ended this part of the conversation by
                            mentioning that the purpose <pb n="374" facs="0395" xml:id="pg_374"/>of
                            our congressional consultation had been to explore the possibility of
                            amending the 1960 agreement to permit use of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-furnished arms for the defense of the Sahara and
                            Mauritania, and that congressional opposition had been focussed
                            specifically on this point because of the question of
                            self-determination.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> undertook to pass
                            Secretary’s letter without delay to the King, along with a report of our
                            conversation. King would be highly disappointed, and would probably find
                            it difficult in view of his conversations with visiting U.S. officials
                            in recent months to understand how <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            could arrive at this conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> added.</p>
                        <p>8. Regarding last para of <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss> B,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> gave no indication
                            of substance of King’s message he will be carrying to President despite
                            occasion during conversation when he could have done so.</p>
                        <p>9. In brief reference to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Sahara
                            mediation efforts, I mentioned that Washington had sent circular cable
                            to a number of our Embassies in Africa supporting the holding of special
                            Sahara summit in Libreville, now again postponed.<note n="9"

                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> replied that this summit
                            would in any case have accomplished nothing. The Moroccan position was
                            clear: there was no question of abandoning the Sahara. I noted the
                            desirability of further efforts to try to reach a peaceful solution in
                            the Sahara and to meet concerns about self-determination. While a
                            referendum now appeared impractical, I wondered, speaking personally,
                            whether one might consider a visit of a prestigious, neutral group to
                            sound out opinion in the Sahara after two years of Moroccan/Mauritanian
                            administration, followed by a report to <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Such efforts might have positive impact, for example,
                            in the Congress. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> noted
                            the idea with interest, but naturally made no commitment.</p>
                        <p>10. As <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> had others waiting

                            in the Sahara, noting such statements would be seized on by Morocco’s
                            “opponents” and could cause problems in our relations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> noted that decision to send
                            him here had been made by King, and King’s letter written, before U.S.
                            had informed Morocco of decision not to sell OV–10’s and Cobra’s to
                            Morocco for use in the Sahara. He stated that the King was dismayed and
                            very sorry to receive our negative reaction and could not understand why
                            we would not help Morocco against an adversary who was receiving
                            unlimited arms from the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> said that in the message conveying negative
                            decision, Secretary had indicated we could not go forward “at this time”
                            to the Congress. He understood that there may be some reason on our part
                            to delay such action but he hoped and urged us to review situation and
                            to present Moroccan request to the Congress as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>[5.] At appropriate points during <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName>’s comments, Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_MWS_1">Mondale</persName> emphasized great importance to
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> of our close relations with
                            Morocco and our respect and appreciation for King. Vice President
                            assured Foreign Minister that he would personally deliver King’s letter
                            to President and that he would also discuss issues raised by <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. He noted that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> would focus
                            personally on letter and would reply in near future.</p>
                        <p>[6.] <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> expressed his
                            condolences on the death of Senator Humphrey, extolled the Senator’s
                            virtues as a human being and statesman and stated that Morocco would
                            like to be officially associated with any memorial planned for Humphrey.
                            He emphasized that Senator Humphrey belonged to all of the people of the
                            free world, to which, of course, Morocco belonged. Vice President
                            expressed his deep personal appreciation for Foreign Minister’s tribute
                            to Senator Humphrey and he asked his assistant, Mr. Clift, personally to
                            follow up with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> concerning a Moroccan contribution to the HHH
                            memorial.</p>
                        <p>[7.] At very end of meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> stated that the King very much hoped to come to
                            the United States for an informal working visit of perhaps a day and a
                            half in near future. In making this presentation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> emphasized that what he meant
                            was that the King wanted to come here in the very near future. In reply,
                            Vice President expressed our great appreciation and respect for the King
                            and noted that we would of course be happy to welcome him to the United
                            States. The Vice President cautioned, however, that the date for any
                            visit would depend upon President’s schedule. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said he understood and
                            repeated how much the King wanted to come in the very near future.</p>
                        <p>[8.] On behalf of the Vice President, Mr. Clift emphasized to both
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> after the meeting that the
                            Vice President had not made any commitment as to timing for such a visit
                            and he hoped this was clear to the Moroccans.</p>

                        <p>1. At small March 20 dinner, which was our first meeting since my return
                            from Washington five days earlier, King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"

                            said laughingly, “Well, I see you were not able to bring me back the
                            OV–10’s.” After greeting the other guests, he said he wanted me to know
                            that he had no need at this time for the OV–10’s and the Cobras, that
                            the situation was well in hand in the Sahara, but that he would
                            definitely need the OV–10’s and Cobras in the future for the defense of
                            his country [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                            friendly discussion on Moroccan use of American arms. I began by

                            and Pumas from France, but that he would need them in the future to
                            defend his country [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        <p>2. Drawing fully on points contained in <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss>, I continued with detailed presentation of case for
                            Moroccan respect in practice of U.S. interpretation of Morocco’s
                            territorial limits specified in 1960 bilateral military assistance
                            agreement, noting likelihood of close congressional questioning on this
                            issue and potential adverse linkage with next year’s <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits for Morocco. Also outlining
                            current blockage of <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>’s, I concluded
                            with request for assurances on end-use of U.S. military assistance,
                            specifically including <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> equipment
                            already in Moroccan inventories and future commercial sales under
                            munitions control procedures. Regarding non-use in the Sahara of <gloss

                            references to <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>’s
                            assurances given in Washington March 13 (para 6 of State 069811).<note

                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> responded that Morocco did
                            not wish to complicate our bilateral relations and in fact hoped to help
                            the Department in any way it could in problems it might have with
                            Congress. In this regard, he said he wished to reiterate, as he had done
                            in Washington, his <pb n="380" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_380"/>categorical
                            assurances that past or future materiel furnished by the United States
                            would never be used for aggression, that it would be employed solely for
                            legitimate self-defense, and that Morocco would fully respect any and
                            all agreements with the United States. He considered that these
                            assurances should assuage concerns in Congress.</p>
                        <p>4. Asked about the applicability of these assurances because of our
                            differing interpretations of Morocco’s territorial limits, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> repeated, again as he had
                            explained to the Secretary in Washington, that he could not state there
                            was a difference between two parts of Morocco—Morocco with and Morocco
                            without the Sahara. He and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> then repeated that I was accredited to the
                            Kingdom of Morocco which included the Sahara, and noted that when
                            Tarfaya and Sidi Ifni had been recovered from Spain, the United States
                            recognized that its then Ambassador became accredited to the Morocco
                            that included these two areas with no questions raised. Without
                            belaboring the point, I merely noted this subject was reviewed at length
                            with him in Washington by Department officers who explained the
                            differing circumstances between the Sidi Ifni/Tarfaya and the Sahara
                            cases. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> then recalled
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s undertaking to
                            review personally the background of the Sahara situation, and hoped this
                            move would remove the unfortunate U.S. distinction between
                            administrative control and sovereignty. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> went on to say he just could not understand how
                            “two allies” could reach a point where one defines the territory of the
                            other to the political and security detriments of the latter. Recalling
                            the origin of the secret 1960 agreement, he said he could quite
                            understand U.S. concern over the use against Israel of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-furnished arms either directly by
                            Morocco or through transfer to a third country. This, he said, has not
                            and will not occur.</p>
                        <p>5. When I mentioned the Secretary’s concern previously expressed to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> over the presence of
                            F–5s in Mauritania (and I added here the same holds true for F–5s in the
                            Sahara), the <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> said he was not
                            aware of F–5s in these areas at this particular time. Persuaded the
                            issue would not arise during the current congressional hearings on
                            military assistance, he commented that as far as he knew there was no
                            longer any public focus on this issue. I said that there had been past
                            press reports of F–5s in Mauritania and in the Sahara, that there could
                            very well be future press reports about F–5s in these areas, and that in
                            Washington’s view, the best solution would be a quiet withdrawal of the
                            planes in question. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> then
                            asked rhetorically if this meant that the U.S. wished Morocco to cease
                            helping Mauritania against external aggression. If so, this would
                            contradict President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>’s
                            statement of support and understanding for Moroccan assistance to
                            Mauritania and his concern over the threat to peace in Africa from the
                            Soviet Union, Cuba and Algeria expressed to PriMin Osman in Washington
                                <pb n="381" facs="0402" xml:id="pg_381"/>on December 3 last

                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> without delay. I responded that, on
                            the contrary, the administration had had informal consultations with the
                            Congress in an effort to be responsive to Morocco’s needs, and that in
                            these consultations we explored the question of amending the 1960
                            agreement to expand its scope to include the use of U.S. equipment by
                            Morocco for the defense of Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>6. At the conclusion of meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> acknowledged that he was fully aware of U.S.
                            concerns regarding Moroccan use of American arms in Mauritania and the
                            Sahara, and reiterated he hoped that <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> had provided adequate assurances in this regard. In
                            view of continuing U.S. preoccupation, however, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> indicated that he was
                            instructing Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>
                            to address the subject in greater detail soon after his return to

                                >Bengelloun</persName> added that he would request meetings with the

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had the
                            opportunity for a thorough exchange of views with Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> on a variety of
                            issues of common concern. We welcomed this occasion to consult closely
                            and to obtain from the Foreign Minister directly your Government’s views
                            on these important matters.</p>
                        <p>As you know, our exchanges here included a full discussion of the
                            specific issue of my Government’s public statements regarding the
                            Sahara. I trust Your Majesty now appreciates the circumstances under
                            which such statements were made and understands that, in all our public
                            statements concerning Morocco, we seek to emphasize the excellent
                            character of bilateral relations, appreciation for the cooperation
                            Morocco traditionally has extended the United States, and the great
                            admiration in this country for the courage with which you and your
                            advisers have defined Morocco’s international orientation.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed of your suggestion for discussions here in
                            Washington next month. Unfortunately, my calendar for May is very
                            crowded, as several state visitors are already scheduled, and there will
                            be a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> summit in Washington at the
                            end of the month. I suggest, however, that through our foreign ministers
                            we find a time for a meeting which will be mutually convenient. I look
                            forward to the chance to exchange views with you.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, you have my very best personal wishes and you can be
                            assured of the lasting bonds of friendship that bind our two
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has long hoped that
                            we would see Morocco as belonging to the same category as Iran as a
                            medium-size power sharing common interests with the United States. To
                            this end, he has developed a fairly articulate presentation of the
                            Soviet threat in Africa and Morocco’s potential role in meeting it. As
                            we saw in Shaba, there is a limited Moroccan capability to act, but it
                            should not be exaggerated. The King has his hands full back home and, as
                            much as he might wish it, Morocco is not in the Iran-Saudi Arabia-Egypt
                            league in terms of our national interests. (S)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> comes on as very strongly
                            anti-Soviet in his talks with us, but he is a shrewd operator who knows
                            how to hedge his bets. His Prime Minister was recently in Moscow to
                            conclude a very large phosphate deal.<note n="3" xml:id="d160fn3"

                            helping to bring about Egyptian-Soviet rapprochement. Like most Middle
                            Eastern leaders, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> is
                            skilled at keeping several balls in play at once. (S)</p>
                        <p>I do not think that we should aspire to a dramatically increased role in
                            Morocco. The French are taking the lead, appropriately, in meeting
                            Morocco’s military needs, and <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> has now admitted that he does not have an urgent
                            need for the OV–10s and Cobras. Our interest is primarily to keep the
                            Soviets out of North Africa, and to that end we should quietly be trying
                            to ease Moroccan-Algerian tensions. For the first time, the Algerians
                            have talked seriously to us about a political solution to the Sahara
                            conflict. This may not be possible, but then again it may be. In any
                            case, I think we need to look at how we can use our leverage with
                            Morocco—recognition of Moroccan sovereignty in the Sahara and release of
                            the OV–10s and Cobras—to get some movement on the political front.

                            Washington between May 21–23. I do not think we will have our own
                            thoughts in order by then, and I am not very enthusiastic about
                            non-substantive symbolic visits at a time when the President has plenty
                            of serious business to attend to. I would favor a visit once we have a

                            about half an hour and we will have a few minutes at the end of our
                            meeting here to talk privately as well.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2"

                                    corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> met on the afternoon of
                                November 14 for a discussion on Iran. A memorandum of conversation
                                is ibid. They also met privately that evening after the State
                                dinner.</note> Last night we discussed the desirability of increased
                            cultural exchange and in expanding the opportunity for students to study
                            in the United States. We also want to increase American business
                            investment in Morocco, and we understand the process of Moroccanization
                            that is underway. We are eager to participate in mutually advantageous
                            ways in expanding our trade relations. We hope to conclude a nuclear
                            cooperation agreement. Your constructive leadership in the
                            non-proliferation treaty and in non-proliferation policies is
                            appreciated. I hope that any differences that prevent rapid progress can
                            be removed during your visit.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>:</hi> When I take leave of you today, I want you
                            to know how much I appreciate what I have seen and heard here. The
                            President has twice praised our ancestors who brought our two countries
                            closer together. I hope that these forty-eight hours that we have had
                            together have measured up to the level of our past. Today we can
                            multiply our relationship ten times over because of rapid means of
                            communications.</p>
                        <p>Many observers of Morocco are surprised by our plans, both on the
                            external and internal fronts. We seem to run in all directions. This is
                            part of our historical legacy. It is no surprise that we have troops in
                            Shaba. One thousand years ago our teachers were in the Sudan. We took
                            medicine and science to Europe. Wherever we went, we never took things
                            for ourselves, but we left elements of civilization behind. The
                            President should know that our actions in the Middle East and in Africa
                            are not exhibitionist, they are part of our history.</p>
                        <p>We never want to put our friends in an embarrassing situation. As long as
                            we can go on alone, we will do so. When we can’t, we will call for help.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> came to see me last
                            summer to ask what kind of assistance the United States could
                                offer.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">See <ref target="#d230">Document
                                    230</ref>.</note> I don’t downgrade material economic
                            assistance, but the best form of aid is for the United States to say in
                            each of its embassies throughout the world that the United States and
                            Morocco are very close friends. This is the strongest form of aid and it
                            hurts no one. It is an effective form of assistance.</p>
                        <p>Countries, of course, do not live by sentiments alone. Morocco has been
                            passing through a difficult financial period. This is not because <pb
                                n="386" facs="0407" xml:id="pg_386"/>our economic prospects are
                            poor. These are circumstantial problems, not fundamental ones. They go
                            back to 1972. We were suffering from a certain restlessness, and we sent
                            our troops to Golan and Sinai. When the October 1973 War took place, we
                            left behind everything that we took. This meant that we had to redraw
                            our plans for armaments. At the time, the prices were all right. But
                            later prices went up by as much as five times. This left us with debts
                            of one billion dollars with France, and a bit less with the United
                            States. We have done everything possible to try to pay off all of our
                            debts, and I believe the last installment is due to the United States at
                            the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>At the Rabat Summit Conference in October 1974, several billion dollars
                            were allocated to the countries that participated in the October
                                War.<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">The Arab League Summit, held at
                                Rabat October 26–29, 1974, voted unanimously for the creation of an
                                independent Palestinian state and recognized the <gloss

                                representative of the Palestinian people. See also <ref
                                    target="#d223fn2">footnote 2, Document 223</ref>.</note> I
                            presided over the Conference as its host. Compensation was offered to
                            me, but I turned it down, and I have remained consistent since then. The
                            Saudis do help us, but less than you might expect. We should not have to
                            knock on doors each time a problem arises. We need some mechanism to
                            deal with these financial problems as they come along. The United States
                            could help in economic cooperation.</p>
                        <p>There is a big project which is about to be concluded now with
                            Westinghouse involving the extraction of uranium from phosphates. This
                            could be a guarantee of Morocco’s future. Morocco has fifteen hundred
                            years worth of reserves of phosphates. These may be turned into a source
                            of energy which Morocco can export. We are also looking for oil and are
                            hopeful to find some. We are oriented to developing medium-sized
                            industries throughout the country. We have serious unemployment problems
                            and we need to create jobs which do not entail excessive costs. We are
                            also working in the agricultural sector. Each year our hydraulic plans
                            produce one million new hectares of land. We are concentrating on
                            intensive agriculture, and we are interested in agro-business projects.
                            Morocco should not depend on the European market for food. But
                            agro-business requires heavy capital investment. It is expensive. In
                            this field, the United States leads the world. We are also making
                            efforts at cattle raising in Morocco. We have worked with the King Ranch
                            with considerable success. A market for our products already exists, for
                            example in Spain. The capital can be found for our projects, but it
                            takes thirty years to train the man to make the projects work. The
                            scholarship funds that you have offered will help inject new blood. I
                            hope that young Moroccans will learn initiative from America. I hope
                            that they will learn about competitive<pb n="387" facs="0408"
                                xml:id="pg_387"/>ness and to use their imagination. It is all very
                            well to create wealth, but we cannot hide it away. It must be put to
                            good use.</p>
                        <p>General DeGaulle said that Morocco is one of the countries to be blessed
                            by its location on both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The
                            Mediterranean can now be seen as a closed sea. With the advent [of]
                            supertankers, and the vulnerability of the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean
                            has changed in significance. Morocco controls one of the openings to the
                            Mediterranean. Morocco is also a link to black Africa, and therefore
                            excites the greed of many countries. We have to defend what we have
                            tenaciously. I therefore would like to outline to you a plan.</p>
                        <p>The President and I are of the same generation. I believe that we are
                            both optimists. I believe that we should think of building a tunnel
                            under the Strait of Gibraltar. This would be the salvation of Europe.
                            Think of the possibilities of the exchange of raw materials from Africa
                            to Europe. This could not be cut off by Soviet submarines. I once
                            mentioned this to <persName corresp="#p_FF_1">Franco</persName>, and
                            some documents were prepared, but we were not able to pursue the idea. I
                            was too far ahead of him in my thinking. But, you, Mr. President, run
                            several miles every day. You can look forward and understand the
                            importance of this project. It could be an inspiration to others. You
                            and I could initiate this as we come to the end of this millenium.</p>
                        <p>I would like to talk about the security of Morocco. I do not want my
                            country to be overarmed, but I want military hardware that is both
                            reliable and suitable. I don’t want to preclude a U.S.-Moroccan military
                            relationship. I hope that the President looked at the maps that I left
                                yesterday.<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">Not found.</note> This part
                            of Africa will be an increasingly heavy burden for the defense of the
                            free world. Suppose Zaire falls. Then Sudan and Egypt will be vulnerable
                            and Africa could be split in two. This would end the use of the Suez
                            Canal. This could pose a direct threat to Saudi Arabia. The northern
                            side of the Mediterranean is not so tranquil either. One-half of Italy
                            is under Communist control. Look at Yugoslavia after Tito’s death.
                            Turkey, a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, is a
                            neighbor of Iran. My neighbors to the south, Libya and Algeria, are also
                            shifting to red. I’ll be alone with France at the western end of the
                            Mediterranean. Spain is not reliable. It cannot be counted on for now.
                            The King of Spain does not want to use his powers. The majority in Spain
                            is fearful. The left is in disarray. The most intelligent man in the
                            country is Carrillo, the Secretary General of the Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>Morocco alone cannot fill the role of the advanced defense of the free
                            world. I don’t need to go on further with you, Mr. President. I <pb
                                n="388" facs="0409" xml:id="pg_388"/>say this mostly to convince
                            myself, not you. I know that you already understand these issues.</p>
                        <p>I have another idea for looking at the law of the sea in a new way. We
                            should talk about the law of the right to the sea. This would be a new
                            doctrine. We would provide some land-locked countries, such as Mali,
                            Chad, and Niger, who have no lung to breathe, no effective
                            communications, with access to the oceans. The international community
                            could undertake to build railroads, and these could be multinational in
                            ownership. They would provide oxygen to these countries. It would help
                            them communicate. I am also convinced that the food needs of the future
                            will come from the sea. We should not leave some countries without
                            access to these resources. I think that the United States, guided by
                            your philosophy, Mr. President, could start a project of this sort. This
                            would win you a place of honor.</p>
                        <p>I’ll end with a biblical reflection. If I have sown good seeds, I am sure
                            some of them will take root.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> This has been very interesting and
                            instructive. You have clearly described the situation as it exists in
                            your area. Our long-standing friendship has been strengthened by your
                            visit. You and your sons have captivated my entire family.</p>
                        <p>I know the economic problems that exist, both in your country and in
                            mine. We can’t always control prices. I understand the circumstances
                            that lead to this, including the recent decline in prices for phosphate.
                            But I am convinced of the basic strength of your country and of your
                            policies and I know your future is bright. We both have great phosphate
                            deposits and strong agricultural systems. To some extent this makes us
                            trade competitors, but also puts us in a position to share our
                            technology and our information. An important example is the Westinghouse
                            project. We also have phosphates in Florida and we are doing some
                            experiments there. We can share our information. Oil shale is another
                            aspect of your future development, and your development of those
                            resources can be rapid. It would be a good idea for us to send some of
                            our business and government representatives to Morocco to explore more
                            fully the investment opportunities and the projects in which we could
                            cooperate. I will ask Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> to pursue this, if you do not object. Secretary

                            with Occidental Petroleum. They have an idea of developing oil shale in

                            concern about these techniques in the United States and I would <pb

                        <p>293669. Subject: King’s Visit: Military Supply Discussions.</p>
                        <p>Summary. During his visit, King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> assured the Secretary that U.S. furnished weapons
                            would not be used outside Moroccan territory. We informed the Moroccan
                            party that this assurance fell short of our requirement and the issue of
                            use of American equipment in the Sahara remains unresolved. We intend to
                            pursue the subject further with Moroccan Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>. End summary.</p>
                        <p>1. At the White House meeting on the morning of November 15 the Secretary
                            had a brief side discussion with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> during which <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> raised question of arms for
                            Morocco. The Secretary said we wanted to help but we needed some
                            assurances regarding how arms would be used. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> said Morocco was ready to give assurances
                            that they would be used only for legitimate self-defense. Secretary said
                            we had a congressional problem with regard to use of these arms in the
                            Sahara. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> contested this
                            but the Secretary held his ground and said we did indeed have a
                            political problem and we needed to take it into account <pb n="390"
                                facs="0411" xml:id="pg_390"/>in our policy. What we needed was an
                            assurance as to where the arms would be used and for what purposes. If
                            the Moroccans, for instance, would tell us they would be stationed at
                            such and such places in northern Morocco and be used only against an
                            invasion threat, that would be satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>2. Afternoon of November 15 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1"
                                >Parker</persName> that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> should
                            show more comprehension of Moroccan needs. He said he was counting on
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> to get <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to change its position from that set
                            forth by the Secretary in the morning. (There was no opportunity to
                            report this conversation to the Secretary before he met with the King
                            that evening.)</p>
                        <p>3. King opened meeting with the Secretary evening November 15 by saying
                            he thought his trip had opened a large window. He did not want to look
                            at problems through the keyhole. If the Department felt the Moroccans
                            must give a letter guaranteeing that American military equipment would
                            not be used outside Moroccan territory, Moroccans would do so. In this
                            regard he suggested jocularly that we might consider Kosygin
                            formula.</p>
                        <p>4. King then described how he had sent Prime Minister Osman to Soviet
                            Union to sign agreements regarding phosphates and fishing.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d162fn2">See <ref target="#d160fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    160</ref>.</note> There was no problem with the phosphates, but
                            Soviets were obviously dragging their feet on the fishing agreement,
                            regarding which they had earlier been very keen. It appeared that
                            question of Sahara coastline was bothering them. Prime Minister was
                            authorized to sign the phosphate agreement and return. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> then summoned his Ambassador
                            from Moscow and sent him to see Kosygin and ask him personal question on
                            King’s behalf: Why did Soviets not want to sign agreement? Was it
                            because of Algerian pressure?</p>
                        <p>5. Kosygin, who had just returned from the Sino-Soviet border area hit
                            the ceiling at the mention of Algerian pressure, pointing out that
                            Soviet Union was an independent state. Ambassador asked if this was the
                            Soviet answer to the King’s question. Kosygin told him to wait ten
                            minutes during which he would draft a text. Kosygin left Ambassador in
                            his office and returned shortly thereafter with typed text in French
                            saying Soviets would fish along Moroccan coastline in accordance with
                            Moroccan laws.</p>
                        <p>6. In any event, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> did not
                            want to embarrass his friends. Any time he might ask for American
                            equipment he would not use it outside Moroccan frontiers. As he had said
                            to President day before, most impor<pb n="391" facs="0412"
                                xml:id="pg_391"/>tant thing U.S. could do for Morocco was to have
                            its Ambassadors around the world openly say that Morocco was our
                                friend.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">See <ref target="#d161">Document
                                    161</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>7. Assuming King’s remarks regarding arms were shorthand response to
                            Secretary’s earlier statement to <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName>, Secretary said he thought we could proceed
                            on that basis.</p>
                        <p>8. November 16 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName>
                            telephoned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>
                            to clarify the nature of the assurances we were expecting from King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> regarding use of
                            American weapons. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said
                            King’s meaning was very clear. He, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName>, was to send the Department a letter stating
                            that American arms would be used only for the defense of Morocco and
                            would not be used outside Moroccan territory. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> noted that in Moroccan context
                            this would include the Sahara. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> replied “of course”, but this did not mean
                            that they would necessarily be used there. The King did not want to
                            embarrass the United States and would do his best to avoid it. But he
                            could not make a distinction between the Sahara and the rest of Morocco
                            in a document.</p>
                        <p>9. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> told
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> that unfortunately
                            he had not been able to inform the Secretary about <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>’s remarks Wednesday
                                morning<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4">November 15.</note> on the need
                            to modify the American position on assurances. The Secretary had assumed
                            that the King’s remarks reflected his acceptance of the conditions the
                            Secretary had specified in his morning conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>, i.e., a commitment where
                            the arms would be and what they would be used for. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> suggested that it might be
                            stated that the arms would be stationed in northern Morocco and used
                            only in the case of invasion in the east. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> replied that an attack was also possible from
                            the south or even from the sea. He protested that what Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> was suggesting went
                            beyond the limits of diplomacy. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1"
                                >Parker</persName> told him he felt there had been a
                            misunderstanding, and he called back later to confirm this. His remarks
                            had been conveyed to the Secretary who said he did not want to spoil the
                            visit and raise the subject with the King this evening, but the
                            Moroccans should have no question in their minds that there had been a
                            misunderstanding. The Secretary had interpreted the King’s remarks as
                            meaning that he would accept the position set forth by the Secretary to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> in the morning. Secretary
                            could not go beyond that.</p>
                        <p>10. We intend to pursue this issue with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> in an effort to get the type
                            of assurances mentioned by the Secretary in his initial conversation
                            reported para 1 above. In the meantime, we <pb n="392" facs="0413"

                            which states that we do not want to sell Morocco arms for use in the
                            Western Sahara, that we will continue to consider new requests for arms
                            sales to Morocco on a case by case basis, and that we will of course
                            consult with Congress as required by law.</p>

                        <p>1. Secretary met with King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            at Blair House following Moroccan Embassy reception evening November

                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> and Boutaleb joined meeting
                            later. Conversation began with military supply (<gloss

                                >See <ref target="#d162">Document 162</ref>.</note> continued with
                            Sahara and later turned to situation in various countries in Middle East
                            and Africa.</p>
                        <p>2. Following discussion of military supply, Secretary said there were two
                            other things he wished to bring up. First of all, he had heard that the
                            King’s appearance at the National Press Club lunch had gone very well
                            and had been well received. He congratulated King. Secondly, he had
                            talked to the Secretary of Commerce and they had agreed to put together
                            a group of government and business people under Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName>, at a time to be agreed on, to
                            follow up on President’s suggestion regarding a trade mission made that
                            morning. It remained to be decided when group should go. King said the
                            sooner the better. Secretary said he had asked Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName> to get in touch with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Returning to Sahara, Secretary said he had been pondering King’s
                            earlier remarks on subject and agreed with him that it was not in our
                            joint interest to have a weak, independent state at that location on the
                            Atlantic. On the other hand, we must be realistic. There was a political
                                <pb n="393" facs="0414" xml:id="pg_393"/>problem. With regard to the
                            United Nations, Moroccans could count on our support for their position
                            that question should be left in hands of <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> Wise Men rather than be subject to new resolution.
                            (This had been requested during talk between Secretary, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> at morning White House
                            meeting); on other hand, His Majesty, as a statesman and politician,
                            must recognize that there was a difficult problem for us. We had voted
                            for the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution regarding
                            self-determination and we had a problem with our Congress over this
                            issue. King interjected that this was a formal problem having nothing to
                            do with our fundamental relationship. Secretary agreed, but said we must
                            nevertheless follow a neutral policy.</p>
                        <p>4. King said this was of course a topical (ponctuelle) neutrality. The
                            Sahara problem was his to resolve. He thought it would diminish as
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> went. In that
                            regard it would not be easy to pick a successor. Two candidates had
                            already asked him to sponsor them during his visit to the United States.
                            He refused to say who they were, noting that there were others who would
                            also ask the same service. He seemed to be in high good humor over
                            this.</p>
                        <p>5. King said that whoever succeeded <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> would not have his influence. He would have
                            many domestic problems and would not wish to be involved in external
                            ones. Secretary asked King’s views as to who successor would be. King
                            said there were at least three factions (clans). First was <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>’s. His position was weakened
                            by his playboy image and fact he was gone from Algiers most of the time.
                            He nevertheless had support of the frontier army (sic) because he came
                            from border area. Second was Yahiaoui, former Commandant of military
                            academy, who controlled the party aparatus. Third was Mirbah, Chief of
                            Military Security, who had control of individual liberties of Algerians.
                            Whoever arrived to power would not stay in place too long.</p>
                        <p>6. King said Yahiaoui’s mentor was Zbiri who had been in exile in Morocco
                            for last five years. Yahiaoui could not act without his blessing. Mirbah
                            had caused too much harm to too many people to be popular.</p>
                        <p>7. King said <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> and he
                            were to have met in Belgium the last week in September, at Algerian
                            request. Col. Dlimi had been at the office of Col. Raas, Chief of
                            Belgian Intelligence, when Mirbah had arrived and said the meeting was
                            off. Raas had been very embarrassed. He had already arranged for three
                            chateaus to be available, one for each party to live in and one of them
                            to meet in. Belgians had nevertheless kept the whole affair secret.</p>
                        <p>8. Dlimi had asked why meeting was cancelled and Mirbah said he did not
                            know. King had then received letter from <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> saying that Moroccan position on Palestine
                            made it difficult for him to meet with <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>. King chuckled over this and wagged his head <pb
                                n="394" facs="0415" xml:id="pg_394"/>in jolly fashion noting that
                            when letter had been sent <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> was already en route to Moscow for
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>9. King said he belonged to ancient school of diplomacy, that of Mohamed.
                            One should talk and talk, and strike (taper) the other from time to
                            time. He was not a violent man and he did not want war. He must admit,
                            however, that had he had the means to reduce Algeria to impotence for 30
                            years he would have done so.</p>
                        <p>10. Secretary asked which of the men King had mentioned was closest to
                            Soviets. King said it was certainly not <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Bouteflika</persName>. He thought it was Mirbah. The Algerian
                            Intelligence Services were closely patterned after the KGB. He turned to
                            Dlimi for confirmation and latter agreed and said all their training was
                            Soviet. He was sure Secretary would agree that Soviet training could
                            mean a change in geopolitics of the region if a Soviet protege came to
                            power.</p>
                        <p>11. Secretary asked what <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>
                            was going to do in near future. King said if <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> remained they would have to fight sooner or
                            later when <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> disappeared.
                            The eclipse of <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> would
                            mean that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would move into
                            the ascendant. If a new leader of Algeria was not a member of the
                            refusal front, that would cause changes in the area.</p>
                        <p>12. Secretary said we understood Sudanese had taken very strong position
                            at Baghdad and that various threats had been made by the hardliners
                            against Numayri. What did King think this might lead to and what could
                            we do to help them? King said it was, of course, Iraq and Algeria who
                            were the menace to Sudan. King said we should keep Sudanese close to
                            Egypt and give a hand to Zaire. Secretary said we were trying to help
                            Numayri with F–5s and C–130s. We needed to give him high priority
                            regarding other material he needed. We could also help him economically,
                            perhaps with an agricultural program. King said we should ask the
                            Vatican to use its influence so that there would be no more fighting in
                            the south. Most of the people there were Christian. Secretary said we
                            might be able to do something in that respect.</p>
                        <p>13. Secretary noted that Kenya played a key role in Africa and asked if
                            we should try to help there as well. King said yes we should, but we
                            should also watch out for the British and keep them from playing their
                            traditional role of tribal politics, which was very dangerous.</p>
                        <p>14. King noted that he had been asked at lunch about the Baghdad Summit.
                            He had replied that Khartoum had been a war summit, while Rabat had been
                            a peace summit. The Baghdad Summit, with its emphasis on no separate
                            peace, was simply a hard-line application of the <pb n="395" facs="0416"
                                xml:id="pg_395"/>Rabat Summit.<note n="4" xml:id="d163fn4">The Arab
                                League Summit convened in Baghdad November 2–5 in response to the
                                Camp David Accords signed in September. The Summit resolved that the
                                Accords harmed the rights of the Palestinian people and urged the
                                Egyptian Government not to ratify the agreements and to align itself
                                with the Arab League. The League also froze its relations with the
                                Government of Egypt. For a summary of the meeting and text of the
                                final communiqué, see <hi rend="italic">Keesing’s Contemporary
                                    Archives, 1979</hi>, pp. 29659–29660. Regarding the Rabat
                                Summit, see <ref target="#d161fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                161</ref>.</note> As he had told the President earlier, he was
                            convinced that the latter’s use of antibiotics at Camp David had reduced
                            the abscess and that which remained could not cause much harm. Jordan,
                            Iraq and Syria, together or separately, could not harm Israel seriously.
                            Begin should not capitalize on this too long but it was a fact.
                            Meanwhile, something must be done about Jerusalem. This issue was
                            particularly troubling to the Saudis; Secretary said he hoped we would
                            be able to come up with an answer regarding Jerusalem, but this would
                            take time. We obviously could not do it today; King nodded and said
                            emotions are obviously running too high.</p>
                        <p>15. Secretary said he wanted pose question to King as friend. Would it be
                            a good idea to have Prince Fahd come to the states to talk about
                            Arab-Israeli problem? King said he would not come if Egyptian and
                            Israeli delegations were here and negotiating or if the treaty had just
                            been signed. If he came he should come in a crisis scenario, i.e., when
                            negotiations were broken off and both parties had gone home.</p>
                        <p>16. Discussion turned to Guinea and Secretary said we had feeling Sekou
                            Toure was about to change his line. King said he would turn, but he had
                            to be approached on tip toes. He had been sent to Czechoslovakia by the
                            French for training in postal work and had returned with a Marxist
                            veneer which had no substance beneath. He was a “primaire” who did not
                            even have a college degree. He would change, but he was afraid to have
                            it said he had done so. The key lay with Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory
                            Coast, who had a father and son relationship with Sekou.</p>
                        <p>17. Secretary said he wanted skip again to other side of continent and
                            asked about the two Yemens. What did King think about situation there?
                            King said that existence of two Yemens was mistake of British
                            imperialism. Frontiers in that area were largely superimposed and
                            meaningless. Secretary noted that we had been prepared to send
                            delegation to South Yemen to look into restoration of relations, but
                            Saudis, who had originally encouraged us to do so, had subsequently
                            changed their mind and asked us not to. Now Saudis themselves had
                            informed us that they were in contact with South Yemenis and they seem
                            to be returning to the idea that we should try to reestablish relations.
                            We were bemused by the Saudi reversals.</p>

                        <p>18. King said Saudis had recently installed perfect young man, Prince
                            Turki, as a Chief of Intelligence; he seemed, however, to be the only
                            man they had, and their information on the Yemen was poor. A few months
                            ago they had been proud to say that 50 percent of the South Yemenis were
                            in Saudi Arabia working and that they were being allowed to repatriate
                            their earnings to Aden. Some two months ago, however, Moroccans had
                            become very concerned at number of South Yemenis fleeing to Saudi Arabia
                            because they suspected there were some black sheep among them.
                            (Implication was that change in Saudi policy might relate to this.) In
                            any event, if there were further untoward incidents in South Yemen,
                            Saudis would reverse their policy again.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Harold Brown</persName> at Blair House
                            November 17. Colonel Dlimi attended from Moroccan side and from U.S.
                            side, Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName>,

                        <p>2. Begin text:</p>
                        <p>GEODSS (S)—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName>
                            explained U.S. interest in a ground-based, electro-optical deep space
                            surveillance site in Morocco. It would track satellites out to 22,000
                            miles as part of a global network of five stations, manned by military
                            and contract personnel, and would have both scientific and defense uses.
                            Morocco had agreed in principle but the memorandum of understanding has
                            not yet been signed.</p>
                        <pb n="397" facs="0418" xml:id="pg_397"/>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> observed that he had
                            accepted the GEODSS in principle, just as the U.S. had agreed to sell
                            the Cobra helicopters and OV–10 planes in principle. “But I am making no
                            linkage,” he said. “We can get helicopters elsewhere if this is
                                embarassing.”<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">An unknown hand placed a
                                checkmark in the right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note></p>
                        <p>The King then asked about the size of the site (10 acres), its “civilian
                            configuration” (scientific mission could be public, but the information
                            has military significance elsewhere), and staffing (6–7 military, 40
                            contractors). The King emphasized that he wanted to be as realistic and
                            discreet as possible about the site. There were political and security
                            elements—“the more that is known, the more I am threatened.” He wanted
                            the staff proportion changed, with the military—in civil
                            dress—constituting the preponderant element because they were
                            disciplinable and trained to be discreet. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> agreed to adjust the ratio as
                            possible and suggested that the civilians could be selected for
                            discretion. The King proposed doing both, noting, “I’d feel more
                            relaxed.”</p>
                        <p>Helicopters (S)—Picking up the King’s reference to helicopters. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> noted that the Hughes
                            500 was, though less armed, more versatile and much less expensive than
                            the Cobra—about a third less. The King said he was familiar with the
                            Hughes and indicated that it was acceptable.<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3"
                                >An unknown hand placed a checkmark in the right-hand margin next to
                                this sentence.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3"
                                >Brown</persName> noted that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> had been discussing the use of military equipment
                            with the King and that such sales would be considered in this light. The
                            King laughed and observed that the President had twice “kidnapped” the
                            Secretary just as they were getting down to business. The next talk,
                            however, would be at the Moroccan Embassy where “I have
                            extra-territorial rights.”<note n="4" xml:id="d164fn4">An unknown hand
                                highlighted the last two sentences in this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <p>Mutual interests (S)—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3"
                                >Brown</persName> then observed that the U.S. and Morocco have
                            mutual interests, a long history of relations, and close cooperation in
                            the defense area since the 1950s when we established bases. King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> responded that
                            Morocco’s attitude toward the U.S. and U.S. equipment had been constant.
                            Morocco had chosen its camp and was in that camp. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> noted that the U.S. was
                            continuing to make many ship visits, that these were much appreciated,
                            and that hopefully the problem that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had been discussing would be
                            resolved in the spirit of cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The King replied that if the two executives are in agreement, they should
                            be able to “dress up” the terms.</p>
                        <pb n="398" facs="0419" xml:id="pg_398"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> cautioned that
                            some executive agreements survive congressional examination while others
                            do not. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> observed
                            that it seemed illogical that the U.S. should sell planes like the F–15
                            and F–16, with their capabilities, in the Middle East but not 150 mph
                            helicopters to Morocco. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3"
                                >Brown</persName> responded that he was about to bring up the Middle
                            East case also, but to make the point that the executive had had a very
                            difficult time persuading Congress to accept it, and in fact had barely
                            succeeded. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> then
                            asked what the Arabs were going to do for pilots, and how long their
                            training would be—noting somewhat jokingly that if they had chosen
                            Mirages, Morocco could have furnished pilots. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> pointed out that there would be
                            no F–15 deliveries until 1981 and that pilot training would take about
                            two years. “Everything will be finished by then”, the King
                            concluded.</p>
                        <p>Namibia (S)—King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> commented
                            that Walvis Bay was the Soviets’ real interest. It was the only
                            deep-water port for 400 kilometers in either direction and very few
                            people were watching it. Namibian human rights and segregation were not
                            really involved. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName>
                            observed that those ideas might not affect the Soviets but they did
                            others. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> responded,
                            “We defend general concepts too, but peacefully. This ties our hands.
                            It’s a paradox.”</p>
                        <p>Shaba (S)—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> observed
                            that in Shaba both the U.S. and Morocco had stood up for their ideas.
                            This was true, the King acknowledged, but he had no illusions there—“the
                            people are not very solid.” While he did not wish to refight old
                            problems, he noted that Korea had its suppliers as did Vietnam. Had
                            Zaire been fully supported two years ago, perhaps at a cost of $17
                            million, it could have settled matters differently in Angola.</p>
                        <p>“Now”, he said, “we are the United States in Zaire, we are only 2,000 and
                            I fear for my men.” If the people were on Morocco’s side, he said the
                            situation would be “okay”. But the people are against the Zairian Army
                            and would reject all authority if they could. If there were another
                            invasion the Moroccan forces could do little. The U.S. should recognize
                            that it was Savimbi and UNITA, by moving their forces to the Zambian
                            border, that had really caused the Katangan guerrillas to withdraw.
                            Morocco is now supporting the security burden alone, and “it has cost $4
                            million to date.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> observed that he
                            could sympathize personally as the Defense Department had spent $15
                            million in Shaba support and has not been repaid. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> emphasized that a solution
                            would have to be found. “We cannot stay beyond the end of the year”, he
                            said, “and I fear we may be headed for a catastrophe.” Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> asked to what extent
                            France and Belgium were contributing. The King responded, “very little.”
                            Belgium was interested in commercial matters <pb n="399" facs="0420"
                                xml:id="pg_399"/>and the security of the Kolwezi mine technicians;
                            the French were concerned with intelligence. “Whether I stay or leave”,
                            he said, “I do not know to what bank window to go.” Perhaps when the
                            forces are withdrawn Morocco would put half of them in France and half
                            in Belgium to recoup their costs.</p>
                        <p>Invitation (S)—King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> then
                            excused himself for transferring all his problems to the Secretary and
                            invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName> to spend one or
                            two days in Rabat for further talks. He would ask the President to
                            authorize it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_3">Brown</persName>
                            said he would like to accept and noted that Morocco had been very
                            supportive in Middle East-European relations. The King smiled, noted
                            that Morocco was perhaps a far-western European country, and suggested
                            that further discussion of the GEODSS program could be carried on with
                            his Ambassador in Washington.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: As follow-up to discussions during King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s visit, Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> met with Moroccan
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> November 27
                            to discuss language <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> could employ to
                            assure <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> on use of U.S. military
                            equipment. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> understood <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not want equipment used in the
                            Sahara, but <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> could not use wording
                            which implied that Sahara was in any way different from rest of Morocco.
                            It also did not want to limit its self-defense options. Following
                            meeting, Department gave <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> text for <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> to carry to Rabat later in week to seek
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> concurrence. End summary.</p>
                        <pb n="400" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_400"/>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> opened
                            conversation by saying the King’s visit had been very important for
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Moroccan relations. Moroccans
                            considered it had been a success, particularly because the King and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> had been able
                            to establish a personal relationship. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                                >Saunders</persName> responded that we, too, had been very pleased
                            with the visit. He noted that the communique had contained more
                            substance than was often the case and had usefully described the breadth
                            of our relations.<note n="3" xml:id="d165fn3">For the text of the joint
                                press statement issued on November 17, see <hi rend="italic">Public

                            said, thought that it was a very positive thing for the King to have
                            come when he did. All in all, the visit provided the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Morocco with something to build on
                            in their bilateral relations.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> then said that he
                            hoped it would be possible to move ahead, on the basis of the visit, to
                            resolve our differences over use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            military equipment. He then reviewed briefly the discussions which had
                            occurred during the King’s visit (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss>). The Secretary had mentioned a possible approach
                            which might help resolve the problem, i.e. for Morocco to give <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> positive assurances on where and how the
                            equipment would be used rather than a negative assurance that the
                            equipment would not be used in the Western Sahara. The idea for such
                            assurances had come from <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                                >Saunders</persName>’ discussion with the King in July, when the
                            King had volunteered that he would deploy Cobra helicopters in the north
                            for use against Algerian armor.<note n="4" xml:id="d165fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d230">Document 230</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> then gave <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> in writing, in both French
                            and English the following formulation: Quote: We would like an assurance
                            which allows us to draw the conclusion that weapons purchased in the
                            United States will not be used in the Sahara. This could be done by
                            stating that the weapons will be stationed and used elsewhere. For
                            example, we might be given the assurance that weapons would be stationed
                            in northern Morocco for use in case of a conventional Algerian attack.
                            Unquote. He cautioned Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> that all three sentences should be read
                            together. Together they met Moroccan requirements by avoiding any
                            specific mention of the Western Sahara but would give us the assurance
                            which we needed in dealing with Congress.</p>
                        <p>4. In reply Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>
                            said that he personally had discussed with the King <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> concerns, i.e. that arms not be used
                            in the Sahara. He noted that the King had asked the Secretary if an
                            assurance that the arms would be used in Moroccan territory to repel
                            external aggression would suffice. The main Moroccan concern was that it
                            did not want to give any impression, particularly in writing, that it
                            drew a distinction between the Sahara and the rest of Morocco. <pb
                                n="401" facs="0422" xml:id="pg_401"/>On the other hand, the King had
                            said he did not want to cause difficulties for his American friends.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said that Morocco
                            was ready to find a formula which would enable it and <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> to resolve this difficulty.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> interjected that the
                            problem with the formula proposed by the King at Blair House was that it
                            did not rule out use in the Sahara.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> responded that the
                            problem with the formula which had just been given was that it did not
                            deal with the possibility of an attack by Algeria in the south. Morocco
                            had a frontier with Algeria there, but under the proposed formula it
                            would not be able to use <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-supplied
                            arms to repel an attack from that direction. Perhaps language could be
                            developed stating that Morocco would use the arms only against an
                            external attack, regardless of where it came from. Such a formulation
                            would be consistent with the 1960 bilateral military assistance
                            agreement. Also, it would have the advantage of not naming Algeria
                            specifically.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> said that he was very
                            conscious that what Algeria did in backing the Polisario constituted a
                            threat to Moroccan forces. Did <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName>’s formulation exclude use of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-supplied arms against the Algerian
                            proxy, the Polisario? If so, something might be possible.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> stated that he
                            understood that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> did not want
                            Morocco to use <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> arms against the
                            Polisario. But the Polisario was only the creation of Algeria, and it
                            sometimes even attacked inside what the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> recognized as Moroccan territory. What about the use of
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> arms in that case?</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> replied that this
                            would be a clear cut case of self-defense.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> then summarized:
                            Morocco wished to avoid, first, any statement that there was a
                            difference between the Sahara and the rest of Morocco, and, second, any
                            limit on its options of legitimate self-defense. He wanted to find a
                            formula which would avoid these two problems and which he could present
                            to the King.</p>
                        <p>11. <gloss target="#t_AFN_1">AFN</gloss> Director <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJK_1">Bishop</persName> suggested that we could assure
                            Morocco that we would have no objection to redeployment of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-supplied arms to repel an attack against
                            territory we considered Moroccan. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                                >Saunders</persName> added that perhaps the Moroccan assurance could
                            state that the arms would be deployed to repel conventional Algerian
                            attack. There was a difference between the Polisario, which was no real
                            threat to Morocco, and Algerian regular troops.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said that the
                            Polisario could exist only with Algerian support. It was using
                            sophisticated weapons that it could only obtain <pb n="402" facs="0423"
                                xml:id="pg_402"/>and operate with Algerian help. The battle was not
                            between Morocco and the Polisario but between Morocco and Algeria.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_BJK_1">Bishop</persName> explained that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> was trying to help Morocco
                            respond to an attack by Algerian tanks and aircraft. If Morocco was
                            involved in the Sahara, it would still need to keep some arms in reserve
                            for use against Algerian attack. We wanted our arms to be in that
                            category. An Algerian attack would be most likely in the north, but if
                            there was an Algerian attack in the south we would have no objection if
                            the arms were moved to the south.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> then asked what
                            would happen if there were Cuban advisers to the Polisario. Those would
                            be foreign troops. <persName corresp="#p_BJK_1">Bishop</persName>
                            replied that he was talking of a main force engagement, not of one
                            mounted in Land Rovers.</p>
                        <p>15. American side then proposed formula along the lines of that which
                            appears below. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> said
                            that if we got acceptable assurances, he would personally discuss them
                            with individual Senators and Congressmen. He hoped this would help ease
                            congressional concerns. There were Congressmen who favored
                            self-determination but also those who were basically friendly to Morocco
                            but had problems with use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> arms in
                            the Sahara. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> noted that
                            it was important to have a formula which Morocco could live with—nothing
                            would be worse than a formula which would cause Morocco problems in the
                            long run, because it would be important to have scrupulous adherence to
                            the language of the assurances. On the other hand, it was important to
                            get the issue out of the way because sales were being held up pending
                            its resolution. He cited as examples the Moroccan request to purchase
                            helicopters manufactured in Italy under <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> license (CH–47), as well as other helicopters (TOW-Cobra
                            and/or Hughes 500). <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>
                            promised to give Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"

                            for a brief visit to Rabat later in the week. He noted that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> would be available if
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> wished to propose
                            any modifications in the language while he was in Rabat.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> also said that it
                            would be helpful if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> could bring back from Rabat some indication
                            of how the Committee of Wise Men was going. The Committee was important
                            for Morocco in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> context, for
                            both of us in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, and for the
                            administration in its dealings with Congress, where there were people
                            who wanted to see evidence of self-determination.</p>

                            given following formulation as possible text for Moroccan assurance:

                            have to cope with the issue at some point in the context of
                            congressional inquiries. There was also the more pressing problem of the

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> explained that his
                            discussion of assurances with the King at Fez on December 7 had been
                            quite brief. The King discussed the issue with him while walking around
                            the garden just after seeing <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s special envoy. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> showed the King the formula we had prepared
                                (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). The King asked, “How
                            can I intervene in Zaire if I make such a commitment.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> inquired what he should do
                            once he had an answer to that question. The King replied in essence,
                            “Just ask the question and get back to me with the answer”.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said that he
                            personally believed that the King was seriously concerned about the
                            issue. He was thinking about it but might not yet be ready to share his
                            thoughts and conclusions, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> suggested. His Majesty could not renounce the
                            defense of the Sahara and might be considering language which would
                            permit him to assure the defense of that area by using other than U.S.
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> replied with regard
                            to the King’s question that if Morocco had a need to use U.S. equipment
                            elsewhere, it could discuss it with us. That was done this year in the
                            case of Zaire, when we gave our approval. There was no prohibition under
                            our bilateral accord as long as we agreed beforehand to use of the
                            equipment elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> then suggested that
                            even without resolving the larger problem, it might be possible to work
                            out an ad hoc solution so that the six Italian built, U.S. licensed
                            helicopters could be delivered to Morocco. <persName corresp="#p_BJK_1"
                                >Bishop</persName> noted that this was an urgent matter because two
                            were ready for delivery and the rest would be ready soon. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> then handed <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> a draft assurance, noting
                            that the idea for this type assurance originated when the King told him
                            in July<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">See <ref target="#d230">Document
                                    230</ref>.</note> that TOW-Cobra helicopters would be based in
                            northern Morocco for use against Algeria. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                                >Saunders</persName> said he recognized that the CH–47s were
                            transport helicopters, making them a different case. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJK_1">Bishop</persName> added that we had discussed use
                            of the CH–47s with the Moroccan Air Force, which had not been prepared
                            to say that they would not be used in the Sahara. <pb n="405"
                                facs="0426" xml:id="pg_405"/><persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"
                                >Saunders</persName> said he was prepared to continue talks on the
                            broader question of assurances but added that the formula proposed for
                            the CH–47s, if accepted, might suggest something which would prove
                            useful elsewhere as well.</p>
                        <p>9. Following is draft assurance on CH–47 helicopters given <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>, which was prepared after

                            the Moroccan and U.S. Governments. Unquote.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said he thought the
                            King would appreciate the U.S. effort in developing the language for the
                            CH–47s. However, in telephone call to <persName corresp="#p_BJK_1"
                                >Bishop</persName> later in day <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> said he doubted King would agree to assurance
                            text provided by <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> and
                            that he wanted to discuss it further on December 22 before sending text
                            to Rabat. While agreeing to further discussion, <persName

                            he called the heart of the problem—the question of how Morocco was to
                            defend a territory over which the U.S. recognized its administrative
                            control. The Polisario was equipped with Soviet weapons supplied through
                            Algeria or Libya, while the Moroccan Army was “mostly equipped with
                            American arms”. What was Morocco to do?</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> replied that while
                            the defense of the territory was one aspect of the problem, the other
                            was the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions and the need for
                            an act of self-determination.<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">Reference is

                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> replied that
                            Morocco was waiting for a visit to Rabat, Algiers, and Nouakchott by the
                            Presidents of Nigeria and Mali, who had been designated as a two-man
                            subcommittee to study the problem and report to the larger <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Committee of Wise Men. However, the
                            Polisario continued its attacks. Morocco was only defending the key
                            centers and would never be the aggressor by carrying the attack to “the
                            other side”. Happily, there as yet had been no large scale attacks using
                            armored vehicles and tanks, which he said would require Morocco to use
                            its U.S. tanks for defense. But from time to time Morocco <pb n="406"
                                facs="0427" xml:id="pg_406"/>had to use its air force for

                            he hoped the Wise Men would be able to explain to Algeria that Morocco
                            would not relinquish sovereignty but that it would be possible to work
                            for economic cooperation in the area.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> added that Morocco

                        <p>2. Department please pass following message to White House for Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has asked that I
                            convey to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>
                            through Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> his deep
                            concern with our position on supply of arms to Morocco which is blocking
                            delivery of Italian-made Chinook helicopters to Morocco. King rejects
                            categorically and once and for all idea that he or his government give
                            us positive assurances such equipment would be used elsewhere than in
                            the Sahara. He said such assurances would be dishonest, and if given
                            sincerely would give us protectorate over Morocco and American
                            Ambassador would be like High Commissioner, telling Morocco where it
                            could and could not put equipment that it was paying for with its own
                            money. Morocco was a small country but it had a flag, a tradition and
                            pride.</p>
                        <pb n="407" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_407"/>
                        <p>4. The King continued that U.S. was in need of allies today but one began
                            to wonder what good it was to be an ally of the Americans (a reference
                            to the Shah). We were prepared to fly Moroccans to Shaba and let them
                            use American weapons to support American interests there, but we were
                            not prepared to let them have unarmed helicopters to defend their
                            homeland. He found our position incomprehensible. He indicated that he
                            was tired of hearing that we had congressional problems and said if we
                            felt we had to go to Congress about the sale of helicopters to Morocco,
                            he would have to go to Parliament about our request for GEODSS
                            installation.</p>
                        <p>5. King noted that we were free country and if we decided we could not
                            let Morocco have these helicopters, then so be it. Our relations would
                            inevitably suffer and Morocco would have to look elsewhere (a reference
                            to Soviets). He would regret this, but Morocco simply could not accept
                            limitations on its sovereignty. He was not prepared to be a beggar going
                            to the U.S. once a week for help. He had other possibilities.</p>
                        <p>6. King said President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> had
                            told him that any time he had a private message, it should go through
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>. He had
                            considered writing a long letter but had decided it was quicker to have
                            me send a telegram. He would like to have a definitive answer by the end
                            of this week as to whether we could release the helicopters
                            unconditionally.</p>
                        <p>7. Above is summary of remarks King made during session which, with
                            interruptions, lasted for an hour and a half. It took place in anteroom
                            of Royal Palace at Marrakesh. Also present were Italian Ambassador
                            Mezzalama, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName>, Royal Counselor <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1"
                                >Reda Guedira</persName>, Secretary General of Defense, Colonel
                            Achabar, and Commander of the Air Force, Colonel Kabbaj. King started
                            off by explaining issue was essentially bilateral one between Morocco
                            and Augusta Bell, but he felt I should be there too in view of role of
                            my government. He then proceeded to tell Italian Ambassador in brief
                            that he wanted Italians either to start delivering the helicopters or to
                            return the $12 million Morocco had paid on account. Failing this, he was
                            going to go to the “international chamber” in London and sue. This
                            would, of course, have serious impact on commercial relations between
                            the two countries and it would shake local confidence in Italian ability
                            to deliver. Italian Ambassador explained that his company had undertaken
                            contract only after checking with Department of State and receiving
                            favorable advisory opinion which indicated that transfer of helicopters
                            to Morocco would be approved. Suddenly they had discovered that American
                            Government had changed its position and was blocking the sale.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">See <ref target="#d166fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 166</ref>.</note> They were like a man hit on the head
                            by a roof tile.</p>
                        <pb n="408" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_408"/>
                        <p>8. For my part, I said that my government was very interested in
                            maintaining our supply relationship with Morocco and we were looking for
                            a pragmatic way to do so. I knew Moroccans were skeptical about our
                            claim of congressional problem, but from the remarks of the Secretary
                            and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> I was
                            confident that senior levels in the Department felt there was indeed
                            such a problem and that Morocco risked finding itself in same position
                            as Indonesia or Turkey. I did not think the parallels were that exact,
                            but Congress often did not understand such things.</p>
                        <p>9. I said we were not demanding withdrawal of equipment already in
                            Sahara, nor had we interrupted the flow of conventional weapons, as King
                            had noted earlier in our discussion. We were prepared to help Moroccans
                            defend themselves against the Algerians, but we had problems about the
                            use of our equipment in the Sahara. Since we understood that the
                            helicopters were going to be based at Rabat-sale and used primarily for
                            logistical support, why not give us some oral assurances to that effect
                            which we would keep to ourselves?</p>
                        <p>10. King replied that location of military equipment within Morocco was
                            none of our business. This was purely Moroccan concern and he could not
                            accept idea that location of such equipment must be cleared with us. If
                            that was a requirement, we should forget the whole thing and the
                            Moroccans would make other arrangements.</p>
                        <p>11. Before and during King’s absence to attend Cabinet meeting, I had
                            rather lively debate with <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1"
                                >Guedira</persName>, both of whom strongly echoed everything the
                            King said in spades. <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> was
                            in fact rather offensive. Before King left room, he had said that if we
                            did not permit the transfer of helicopters, it would lead eventually to
                            a break in relations. King did not second this and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> tried to calm <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> down, but it clear that all of
                            them are quite excited about this issue. Former Ambassador Neumann, who
                            is here on visit and has been making yeoman effort with Moulay Hafid
                            al-Alaoui and Colonel Dlimi on subject, reports similar emotional
                            reaction from Dlimi, who very upset. He plans to stay in Marrakesh a
                            little while longer and hopes to have chance to see King himself and try
                            to explain realities of American politics and desirability of pragmatic
                            solution. Although he and I were rather optimistic about chances of
                            selling our assurances approach before I saw King this morning, I
                            believe we can now forget it. Choice now before us is to approve
                            helicopter sale without conditions or to disapprove it. There is no
                            viable middle ground as far as <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>12. Comment. As I had made clear before, I think our policy on this
                            question is both misguided and inconsistent.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d238">Document 238</ref>.</note> We should have

                            of what King is saying. If we do not find way on our own to approve this
                            sale, there will be a serious deterioration in our relations here. How
                            serious I am unable to say. It will stop short of the break in relations
                            which <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Reda Guedira</persName> is talking
                            about, but I am not sure how far.</p>
                        <p>13. It seems to me that there are valid reasons for our agreeing to the
                            transfer. I summarize some of them as follows:</p>

                            informed MUSLO that “we anticipate no problem in issuing Boeing required
                            export license.” This was when Moroccans were planning to buy equipment
                            in question from Boeing.<note n="4" xml:id="d167fn4">In telegram 2431
                                from Rome, January 31, the Embassy expressed concern that this issue
                                would damage relations with Italy: “The <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                    >USG</gloss> was apparently ready to authorize Boeing to sell
                                Morocco helicopters, but now refuses Agusta the same authorization.”
                                Italian Prime Minister Andreotti also expressed his concern “that
                                the Agusta sale of Chinooks be resolved and has ‛noted’ our decision
                                to sell Boeing civil aircraft to Libya after denying Aeritalia
                                authorization to sell its G–222 military transports.” (National
                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, P840133–1687)</note>
                            We subsequently (Nov. 21, 1977) suggested to Moroccans that they go to
                            Augusta Bell, and interposed no objection to sale.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d167fn5">Not found.</note> Both Moroccans and Italians
                            therefore had every reason to believe we approved, and I suspect we did
                            give Italians favorable preliminary opinion.</p>
                        <p>C. The aircraft in question are relatively inoffensive and at least
                            according to Italian Ambassador, will not be brought into action for
                            another year and a half. It will take that long to train the crews and
                            assemble necessary equipment. By that time, who knows what the situation
                            locally is going to be.</p>
                        <p>D. While I will not belabor the strategic importance of Morocco, we can
                            ill afford to alienate the Moroccans to the extent we will if we do not
                            let the transaction proceed. We may find the Moroccan argument specious,
                            but this is a vital issue to them and they are very worked up about
                            it.</p>

                        <p>15. Note: King has obviously decided take a stand on Chinook issue. Even
                            if we settle this favorably, question of other items wanted by Moroccans
                            will still be posed. We can be certain Moroccans will not be prepared
                            give any positive assurances regarding them. They may be less aggrieved
                            by refusals, however, since they have already had considerable
                            discouragement on those items we are likely to turn down.</p>

                            which currently underway, he expected to be able to inform Ambassador
                            shortly that U.S. would agree to spare parts delivery. <persName

                                    >Boumediene</persName> died on December 27, 1978.</note> He then
                            accused Algerians of refusing to receive a Moroccan delegation to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> funeral and of
                            subsequently rebuffing <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>’s
                            conciliatory overture. He mentioned inter alia that French President
                            Giscard d’Estaing had wanted to mediate the dispute between Morocco and
                            Algeria but that he, like the Moroccans themselves, had been frustrated
                            by <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>’s response to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>, which indicated
                            that the new Algerian regime intends to continue <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s Saharan policy. Having
                            concluded therefore that no solution would be possible through
                            negotiation, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, the
                            Ambassador said, had sent a special message to the Parliament announcing
                            the formation of a Committee of National Defense. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> then described Tan Tan
                            attack, emphasizing that it occurred on territory indisputably
                                Moroccan.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">See <ref target="#d37fn7"
                                    >footnote 7, Document 37</ref>.</note> He warned that the
                            situation could become “dramatic” if such attacks continue.</p>
                        <p>4. Continuing, <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said his
                            government wants U.S. understanding, especially in cases when
                            congressional intervention is not necessary. He said that on April 20,
                            1978, his government had signed a 2 million dollar agreement for F–5 and
                            C–130 spare parts. 258,000 dollars had been paid on October 9 and
                            190,000 dollars on December 18. The Pentagon says that the spare parts
                            are available. Morocco’s need is urgent, and no congressional approval
                            is necessary. There is an imbalance in the air power of Algeria and
                            Morocco. Algeria has enormous military resources, including the latest
                            MiGs. They even are using, in support of the Polisario, Chinook
                            helicopters sold to Libya by the United States.</p>

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> responded that he
                            understood that there had been a problem regarding payments under the
                            spare parts contract but that money had been made available. While
                            ordinarily Congress would not need to be notified of this transaction,
                            the Department had had correspondence from the Congress criticizing the
                            fact that F–5s were being used in the Sahara.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d168fn4">See <ref target="#d235">Document 235</ref>.</note>
                            The Department did not want problems with Congress to become more
                            serious. It had taken steps to notify Congress of the spare parts sale
                            and expected to continue the notification process the following day; the
                            process should be completed shortly. If problems arose, the Department
                            would be in touch with the Ambassador. Explaining further, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that because some consider
                            that there has been a technical violation of the U.S.-Moroccan military
                            assistance agreement, there is a risk that Congress could cut off all
                            arms sales to Morocco. Unfortunately, the U.S. had not been able to
                            obtain from Morocco any assurances regarding use of American equipment
                            which might be helpful in discussing the issue with Congress. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> interrupted by saying that
                            his government could not understand why the U.S. makes a distinction
                            between what it is doing vis-a-vis Algeria and what it did in Zaire. The
                            enemy is the same, i.e., the Soviets and the Cubans, and the fight is
                            the same.</p>
                        <p>6. In responding, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                            explained that in legal terms help given Shaba was justified as
                            assistance to a friendly country to preserve its territorial integrity.
                            This assistance was not justified on the basis of Cuban, Russian or
                            Angolan roles. The Sahara problem, he noted, is regarded by many as a
                            still unresolved territorial question. Returning to the theme of
                            assurances, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said that in
                            their absence the Department was burdened with the task of defending
                            U.S. military assistance to Morocco and must go to the Congress each
                            time it intends to extend assistance. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> replied if Morocco were to evacuate the
                            Sahara, the territory would briefly become a democratic popular republic
                            and eventually an Algerian province. Twenty million Moroccans refuse to
                            surrender any Saharan territory. The Algerians had created the Polisario
                            after the Sahara had been liberated from the Spanish. Why should there
                            be concern for the self-determination of less than 100,000 Saharans in
                            the Western Sahara and none for the 500,000 Saharans in Algeria? Morocco
                            could not agree to any assurance language because it could not accept
                            any distinction between parts of Morocco. Reminded that some of the
                            proposed assurance formulas were based on the nature of possible
                            conflict rather than territorial distinctions, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> said this approach also had
                            proved unacceptable in Rabat.</p>
                        <pb n="413" facs="0434" xml:id="pg_413"/>
                        <p>7. When <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said the United
                            States wants to be as helpful as possible in a situation where it cannot
                            accept the incorporation of the Sahara into Morocco, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> asked if the United States
                            wanted to see Algeria become the most powerful state in the region,
                            dominating Morocco. He characterized U.S. assistance to Yemen as coming
                            a year too late. The U.S. should be looking at the situation in
                            Northwest Africa in a strategic context. Morocco occupies an important
                            position geographically. It has democratic institutions and many other
                            similarities to the United States. Algeria and the U.S. have only an
                            energy relationship in common. There are 20 million Moroccans and 74,000
                            Saharans. Within a Middle East context, Morocco is helpful to the United
                            States, while Algeria stimulates opposition. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> asked which countries have
                            officially recognized Morocco’s recovery of the Sahara, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> avoided a direct reply,
                            pointing out instead that no formal recognition had been necessary or
                            accorded by foreign states when Morocco earlier had recovered other
                            portions of its patrimony. All the countries which have recognized the
                            SDAR, he said, are Communist. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> suggested to the Secretary that the U.S. adopt
                            the formula worked out between Morocco and the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> in their fisheries treaty. As described by <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>, this formula states that
                            the treaty applies to all Moroccan territory, and each side is free to
                            determine what territory this encompasses. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> commented that this formula would not be very
                            helpful with Congress.</p>
                        <p>8. In concluding discussion on other items, <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> that the U.S. is ready to sign the <gloss

                            that the Crown Prince will be visiting the U.S., at which point
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> requested security

                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName>, April 3,
                            1979.</p>
                        <p>1. (S) Entire text</p>
                        <p>2. Today the King received me in his office in Rabat. He saw me alone
                            with only our U.S. interpreter <persName corresp="#p_TAG_1">Alex
                                Toumayan</persName> present, and we talked for over an hour. His
                            welcome was warm and genuine. He was most gracious in his references to
                            his meetings with you and what he <pb n="415" facs="0436"
                                xml:id="pg_415"/>described as the “good vibrations” he had felt and
                            the good rapport between you. His tone throughout was friendly,
                            informal, candid and relaxed. I had expected a more general meeting, but
                            the King’s choice was clearly a private session, despite the fact that
                            the Prime Minister, two other Ministers, and two Ambassadors were kept
                            waiting throughout the audience. An account of our meeting follows.</p>
                        <p>3. In greeting the Secretary the King said that he was not prepared to
                            discuss economic matters in English. He could afford a grammatical
                            mistake, but could not afford to make a mistake when discussing figures.
                            The Secretary said that she had talked to the President before she left
                            and that he took a great interest in her mission. She was bringing his
                            personal regards and a personal message from the President.</p>
                        <p>4. The King stated that President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> had done a great deal and history would note his
                            record. A foundation was one thing—results were another. The secret of
                            overall success is rapid transition to self rule on the West Bank and
                            Gaza. Under the treaty this would take two to three months (sic).
                            Otherwise, we would have a situation where the Palestinians, <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> and the other groups will be trapped
                            in a three-way situation. (1) Engage in subversion in Israel, which they
                            cannot pull off. (2) Terrorism in other Arab countries which is totally
                            illogical. (3) Retaliation against residents of the West Bank, meaning
                            fighting against other Palestinians. The only way out is quick passage
                            to self-rule.</p>
                        <p>5. The period of five years allowed for the creation of a Palestinian
                            state in effect boils down to no more than two and one-half. We cannot
                            afford to let anything tarnish what the U.S. has done for peace. As for
                            Jerusalem, Presidents <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> were right not to raise
                            it. Begin has closed the door. Religious considerations override
                            anything else. Better to wait for the socialists to come to power in
                            Israel. Someone like Shimon Peres will settle this matter in a more
                            flexible manner. Those were the King’s views on the subject in case the
                            President should ask, as he well might.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary expressed her gratitude and that of the President for
                            the King’s courage and leadership since President <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s initial visit and also praised
                            the King for all he had done during the fall for the sake of peace. She
                            stressed that the President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> and all members of the administration were
                            primarily concerned at present over President’s <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s possible isolation after
                                Baghdad.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">See <ref target="#d101fn7"
                                    >footnote 7, Document 101</ref>.</note> The King reassured her
                            completely on that score. He pointed out that Prince Fahd may soon
                            become Foreign Minister and since he is coming to his villa in Fez, he
                            will come to talk to the King about this. The King assured the Secretary
                            that he and the Saudis had decided to scream <pb n="416" facs="0437"
                                xml:id="pg_416"/>and yell like everyone else at Baghdad but not
                            change anything they were doing. He asked her to convey this very
                            confidentially to the President and said that only two or three of his
                            Ministers were informed. [garble] Secretary thanked him for these
                            reassurances and said she knew that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> would appreciate them very
                            much.</p>
                        <p>7. The King expressed his worry over two situations (1) The Soviet Union
                            has recently suffered a defeat in Vietnam. It is a diplomatic defeat
                            because the Soviet Union did not honor any of its treaties with Vietnam.
                            Furthermore, two-thirds of the people of the Soviet Union are Asians and
                            they do not like to lose face. He fully expects to see a trouble spot
                            develop somewhere around the world in the coming weeks as part of a
                            global drive on the part of the Soviet Union to score a token success
                            somewhere. (2) The situation in Iran which the King had discussed at
                            considerable length when in the States.<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d161fn2">footnote 2, Document 161</ref>.</note>
                            The King felt that the Shah was not completely out of the picture. Let
                            us assume that in an empire like Iran each different ethnic group now
                            asking for autonomy should receive it—this could only lead to a
                            confederation. In the United States local origin does not matter, but in
                            Iran everybody would want to be the head of a new confederation. It is
                            conceivable that within the constitutional framework the son of the
                            present Shah could play the role of a unifying national symbol. The Shah
                            himself had told the King he was completely disgusted and would never
                            ascend the throne again. The King considered that this was not an urgent
                            matter but one that the President might want to keep at the back of his
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>8. The King asked for the help of the President and the Secretary with
                            respect to the First National City Bank (FNCB) withholding payment on
                            $450,000 worth of checks drawn by the Shah on his account at FNCB. The
                            checks were presented for collection by the Moroccan bank which had
                            first been assured in writing (copy available) that the funds were
                            available. Three days later FNCB announced that it had been requested by
                            the Iranian National Bank to freeze the account and was so doing. It was
                            not the first time that FNCB had been unfair in its dealings in Morocco.
                            The Secretary assured the King that should follow this up as best she
                            could with both the President and FNCB.</p>
                        <p>9. The King described the present difficulties in Morocco as being of an
                            acute financial nature, more so after the oil price increase of the last
                            couple of days. But there was no way to stop Morocco’s economic
                            “take-off”. In Morocco social, educational and economic problems are
                            interlocked. Since all education is free for the public, in ten years
                            the entire budget will go for education if no solution is found, and
                            15,000 new teachers must be trained each year. By the year 2000 if 36
                            new <pb n="417" facs="0438" xml:id="pg_417"/>classrooms have not been
                            built every day, the requirements cannot be met. This is clearly
                            impossible as both the Secretary and the King agreed. The time may come,
                            the King said, when he may have to decree that higher education must be
                            paid for by those who can afford it.</p>
                        <p>10. At the same time, the King said, one cannot have situation where
                            industrial projects are waiting to be carried out and there is a lack of
                            technically trained staff to carry them out. The King knows that
                            agriculture will remain the prime resource of Morocco—both land and sea
                            cultivation. He looks to oil shale as the major resource for the future,
                            giving the preference to the “hammer” in situ process which has a cost
                            of $9 per barrel. Oil shale permits energy self-sufficiency in
                            Morocco.</p>
                        <p>11. In agriculture the problem lies in the lack of large cultivation
                            areas permitting intensive cultivation. The King was anxious to have the
                            Secretary help in arranging for agribusiness groups to come to Morocco.
                            The Secretary expressed our keen interest in developing relations
                            between Morocco and the agribusiness sector. The President of <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> had discussed those possibilities.
                            We are eager to cooperate by linking projects and potential investors.
                            The Secretary had worked with the Ministers of Commerce and Agriculture
                            outlining the process which we could follow. The King announced the
                            recent creation of an inter-ministerial task force to facilitate foreign
                            investor contacts. This would change what he described as a situation
                            where, typically, an American investor spends three months making the
                            rounds of Ministries to secure various permits and after three months
                            gives up and goes home. This inter-ministerial task force will meet
                            every two weeks and examine foreign investor proposals. They will set
                            aside those they do not want. Those that are going forward will be
                            accepted and signed simultaneously by all Cabinet Ministers. This
                            streamlining will facilitate matters as will also the sending to the
                            Moroccan Embassy in Washington of a strong agribusiness/commercial
                            unit.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary expressed her gratification and stressed the excellent
                            rapport she had established with the Ministers with whom she had had
                            working sessions as well as with the Prime Minister. She felt they were
                            eager to address themselves to existing problems in order to move
                            forward in the sense desired by both President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> and His Majesty.</p>
                        <p>13. The King went back to energy and costs to state that so far Morocco
                            was paying for the cost of the inter-African force in Zaire, $55 million
                            in cash so far, and when the Belgian Foreign Minister had asked how
                            Morocco would be reimbursed the King had said no bill would be presented
                            but he would like the U.S., France, U.K., Belgium and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> to invest in specific projects in
                            Morocco up to the equivalent amount. The <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1"
                                >EXIM</gloss> Bank could be the instrumentality through <pb n="418"
                                facs="0439" xml:id="pg_418"/>which the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would make such contribution. <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1"
                                >EXIM</gloss> was already very active in Morocco. They could take a
                            share in phosphates, Bureau of Mine Research and Prospecting (BRPM),
                            oil, etc. <gloss target="#t_EXIM_1">EXIM</gloss> had helped Morocco
                            acquire its first 747. Morocco was ready for a second one because it was
                            such an eminently profitable aircraft.</p>
                        <p>14. The King asked for the Secretary’s help in resolving the delicate
                            matter of the alleged bribe paid by Grumman Aircraft to a former
                            Lebanese Prime Minister who was alleged to have then turned it over to a
                            Moroccan figure. The King was emphatic in stating that he wanted the
                            President to assure the U.S. Attorney General that this matter must be
                            explored thoroughly and all possible light shed upon it. The entire
                            truth must come out. The Secretary responded that although she was aware
                            of the problem she had not been briefed about it in detail. She knew
                            that the Attorney General would pursue this matter very seriously and
                            she would discuss it with the President, because he, too, would want
                            this point to be put to rest quickly.</p>
                        <p>15. The King invited the Secretary to come back for a private vacation
                            with her family. He expressed interest in having his children know the
                            Secretary’s children. He felt it was particularly important for the
                            Crown Prince, age 16, to know younger people slightly older than
                            himself. The King invited the delegation to come in for greetings and
                            summarized very briefly for Minister Guessous some of the points he had
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>16. As the Secretary was departing, the King asked when a mission of U.S.
                            business investors could be arranged.</p>
                        <p>17. The Secretary responded that we had not brought investors on this
                            trip because we felt that additional preparations were necessary. Once
                            sufficient preparations are completed, a mission could be arranged at
                            the King’s convenience. The King concurred that the schedule should be
                            carefully worked out in order not to waste time.<note n="4"

                            signs of success. No one believes a pure military victory is possible,
                            but <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> shows little
                            willingness to accept a political compromise. Even if we do liberalize
                            our arms transfer policy, we will not be able to help turn things around
                            in the Sahara. We might, in fact, encourage <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to conclude that the military option is viable.

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> On a case-by-case basis, we should
                            continue to approve some Moroccan arms requests; we should encourage

                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Economy</hi>. The economic downturn is serious and is

                            and the Saudis have cut off aid, largely because they could not keep
                            track of where it was going. More money from us will not do much good,
                            but the Saudis could help. (S)</p>

                        <p>Finally, we have been quietly exploring whether there is some way to
                            encourage a political solution to the Sahara conflict. State’s status

                            prepared to help find a solution, which would be very encouraging. There
                            are distinct limits on how much we can expect to do to mediate the
                            Sahara conflict, but some of our friends could do more. <hi

                            ourselves, particularly while the Spanish are engaged in this process.
                            We will continue to consult closely with them, as well as with the

                                Central Foreign Policy File, D790240–0333) In telegram 137751 to
                                Rabat, May 30, the Department informed the Embassy that a Moroccan
                                source claimed that Saudi Arabia agreed to a $3 billion aid package:
                                “1 billion dollars for military equipment, 1 billion dollars for
                                economic infrastructure, and 1 billion dollars for specific
                                development projects.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign
                                Policy File, D790244–0703)</note> Given these circumstances, the
                            advice some time ago from a responsible Saudi official that we avoid
                            becoming involved in the Saudi-Moroccan relationship, and the current
                            condition of our own relations with the Saudis, we think it best to let
                            the Moroccans speak to the Saudis for themselves.</p>
                        <p>Corruption persists in Morocco, and the King recognizes that it is a
                            liability for his regime. We currently are discussing with the Moroccan
                            Government the negotiation of an agreement between the Department of
                            Justice and their Ministry of Justice which would facilitate the
                            exchange of information American authorities might have about bribery of
                            Moroccan officials by American corporations. We are confident that the
                            King is aware of the perils of economic stagnation. But the Moroccan
                            Government has little choice but to reduce expenditures, given the heavy
                            burden of foreign debt incurred before phosphate prices tumbled.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName> shares these
                            views on corruption and economic stagnation in Morocco.</p>
                        <p>A recent analysis by our military mission in Rabat has underlined
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s responsibility for
                            the poor performance of his armed forces in the Sahara. The mission
                            identifies the Moroccan Army’s most serious problem as the King’s
                            refusal to delegate authority for the conduct of the war. Since the coup
                            attempts mounted by military conspirators in 1971–72, the King has been
                            his own chief of staff, and it is unlikely he will allow his military
                            officers the freedom of action they need to wage war efficiently.</p>
                        <p>Given Morocco’s inability to resolve the Sahara conflict militarily, and
                            the fact Morocco will remain in the doldrums economically for at least
                            another 18 months, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s
                            position will be precarious for some time. Our ability to influence
                            events is limited by <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s
                            unwillingness to take advice, his poor performance as an administrator,
                            and <pb n="424" facs="0445" xml:id="pg_424"/>the massive amounts of
                            capital which would be required to freshen Morocco’s economy. He would
                            not be interested in hearing our views on the origins of the Iranian
                            revolt. We can help him best by encouraging a negotiated end of the
                            Sahara conflict. Occasional demonstrations of Administration support
                            will be helpful in reassuring the King, the military, and the political
                            parties of our interest in his regime, particularly in its security, but
                            we cannot expect them to be decisive in preserving the monarchy.</p>

                                of Morocco, May 29, 1979</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I attach hereto a complete recitation, in chronological sequence, of my
                            two and one-half hour meeting with the King.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2"
                                >The memorandum of conversation is attached but not printed.</note>
                            The King seemed pleased that you had sent an emissary and the
                            atmospherics throughout my one-day visit to Fes could not have been
                            better. A summary of our discussion follows:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Peace Negotiations</hi>. The negotiating process has
                            polarized the Arab world against Egypt and could bring results opposite
                            to those we desire. Nevertheless, all Arab countries except Iraq and
                            Syria want peace (and perhaps Libya, which is an enigma). The people of
                            Iraq and Syria want peace but the leadership sees the peace process as
                            threatening to their positions. The King said that President Assad of
                            Syria is a “broad thinker” and understood the necessity for peace in the
                            region, but is a “minority within a minority.”</p>
                        <pb n="425" facs="0446" xml:id="pg_425"/>
                        <p>I mentioned the Strauss appointment to the King, that he had your
                            confidence and that he is a skilled, fair, and capable negotiator.<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">Robert S. Strauss was named the President’s
                                Special Representative to the Middle East peace negotiations in
                                April.</note> The King said he wants “to help you 100 percent,”
                            because both you and he are “believers” in the peace process. He
                            emphasized that he must “monitor” progress on the West Bank-Gaza
                            negotiations about to commence in Alexandria, and that progress on this
                            issue is essential.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Palestinian Issue</hi>. The King said the
                            Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty should be “put aside” pending the
                            commencement of treaty negotiations with other involved States. This
                            brings the Palestinian issue into focus. The King repeatedly commented
                            on the overriding importance of the Palestinian issue. He said, with
                            great conviction, that no other Arab country would undertake their peace
                            negotiations until there has been some accommodation with the
                            Palestinians. He said that the Arab countries were more afraid of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> than they were of Israel.</p>
                        <p>The King said he met with the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> in Fes
                            two weeks ago. They are “ripe” for a negotiation. He said that if the
                            U.S. would “not veto” the proposed Jordanian resolution addressing the
                            rights of the Palestinian people to self determination, the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> would immediately thereafter accept
                            U.N. Resolution 242. He inferred, without explicitly so stating, that he
                            and King Khalid had discussed this approach during Khalid’s visit to Fes
                            last week. This would enable other involved countries to begin
                            negotiations, looking to a comprehensive treaty, of which the
                            Egyptian-Israeli Treaty would be a part.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> recommended “informal
                            and very discreet” contacts between the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, observing that earlier contacts
                            between General Walters and the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> had
                            remained secret and moreover had demonstrated that the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> will honor commitments. While he
                            recommended there be “no agenda,” agreements such as the above could be
                            discussed. He admitted that such contacts were “not without risks,” and
                            offered “his residence and his services” to assist if desired.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> takes very seriously his chairmanship of the
                            Jerusalem Committee.<note n="4" xml:id="d174fn4">Reference is to the
                                Al-Quds committee, an offshoot of the Organization of the Islamic
                                Conference, whose purpose was to support Moslem claims to Jerusalem,
                                including the formation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
                                capital.</note> Jerusalem is the single issue around which all 900
                            million Moslems of the world will rally. He intends to be deeply
                            involved in the resolution of the Jerusalem question, but was
                            pessimistic as to early progress because of Prime Minister Begin’s
                            attitudes. He said that if a man like Shimon Peres, a person of “much
                            broader view <pb n="426" facs="0447" xml:id="pg_426"/>and intellect”
                            than Begin should succeed Begin, he would be much more optimistic.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Egyptian-Saudi Arabian-U.S. Relations</hi>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> made a “blunder” when
                            he failed to consult with the Saudis prior to his trip to Jerusalem.
                            King Khalid told King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            that other Arab nations would see him “either as a fool or as an
                            accomplice” if he renewed support of Egypt “at this time.” King Khalid
                            said the Saudis were in an impossible dilemma: They know they must
                            continue their close relationship with the U.S. over the long term, yet
                            their relations with the other Arab states and their concerns about the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> require a current posture
                            somewhat more distant. King Khalid told King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> during their meeting last week
                            that the Saudis would continue oil exports, would be constrained on
                            price increases, and that they recognized clearly their long term best
                            interests required a close relationship with the U.S. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> urged that we not pressure
                            Saudi Arabia to re-commence aid to Egypt “at this time,” and that we
                            permit things to “cool off” for several months. The King told me he
                            continues “very confidential” contacts with <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> which he sees as constructive and potentially
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi></p>
                        <p>a. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> said he would
                            withdraw his troops from Shaba Province by July 1, that their morale was
                            poor, and that this venture had “cost him $60 million.” Prior to the
                            withdrawal he will send instructors to Zaire to train Mobutu’s soldiers.
                            I told him I had heard of a “phased” withdrawal plan to occur over two
                            or three months. He was quite emphatic that this would not be
                            acceptable; that he must withdraw all of his troops now. (Since there
                            was an obvious disconnect in what Mobutu had said publicly, and what I
                            was hearing from King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, I
                            did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tell him we were prepared to participate
                            in the airlift to return his troops and equipment to Morocco. I felt we
                            might wish to negotiate a “phased” withdrawal, and should withhold any
                            such offer until that time.)</p>
                        <p>b. Rhodesia. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> believes
                            that the Rhodesian “experiment” must work, and that the comments of
                            Ambassador Young are not helpful.<note n="5" xml:id="d174fn5">Possibly a
                                reference to remarks Young made warning against recognition of the
                                newly-elected government in Rhodesia. In a televised interview, in
                                which he also opposed lifting sanctions, Young suggested the
                                economic sanctions could force Muzorewa to negotiate a settlement.
                                He also called into question the legitimacy of the election: “Mr.
                                Young said the election in Rhodesia was ‛stolen before it got
                                there,’ meaning the Constitution drawn up by Prime Minister Ian D.
                                Smith was fraudulent in that it served to perpetuate white minority
                                power.” (“Young Warns Against Recognition of the New Rhodesian

                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Bilateral Relations</hi>. The King said we
                            understood his views on all bilateral issues, his problems in the
                            Western Sahara, and his specific arms needs. Rather than go over them
                            again, he said he would only mention that economic development was
                            essential for Morocco; that “freedom and poverty cannot co-exist”; that
                            his projected population growth (from 19 million to 40 million by the
                            year 2000) required significant economic development. He mentioned
                            phosphate, oil and oil shale as having economic potential, and solicited
                            our help on these or other development initiatives.</p>
                        <p>He said he had asked King Khalid for various forms of assistance, and
                            seemed optimistic that he would receive it.<note n="6" xml:id="d174fn6"

                        <p>He said that the Mediterranean was “very polluted politically” and that
                            Morocco’s enemies did not want to see the “constitutional example” of
                            Morocco succeed. If his development needs are not met, an extreme
                            government of either the left or right would inevitably be the
                            result.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi>. In my judgment, the King was
                            speaking to me out of deep conviction and a genuine desire to be
                            helpful. He feels himself under great pressure from a combination of
                            economic problems and a war in the Western Sahara that may not be
                            winnable. The lack of Saudi aid, discontinued in 1978, has affected the
                            Moroccan economy adversely, and he feels compelled to re-establish this
                            economic assistance. This has driven him to an accommodation with Saudi
                            views on the peace negotiations.</p>
                        <p>He thinks he has made a valuable suggestion on the Palestinian issue
                            which could enable peace negotiations to commence with other involved
                            states. He would welcome your asking him to assist you on this.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend an interagency review of our arms supply policy to
                            Morocco in view of Polisario incursions into Moroccan sovereign
                            territory, and a reassessment of our options to assist in a negotiated
                            settlement of the Western Sahara issue.</p>
                        <p>The King spoke of you and your family in the warmest possible terms
                            emphasizing throughout the meeting his desire to help you in any way
                            possible. He said he would welcome a “privileged” channel of
                            communication with you such as he had with U.S. Presidents “prior to
                            Watergate.” He asked me to mention to you that his wish is that <pb

                            King’s counselor, was or was not authorized to disclose publicly is
                            indicative of the turmoil inside the highest levels of the Moroccan
                            government over next steps (especially vis-a-vis this week’s <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit in Monrovia); (C)</p>
                        <p>—Next week’s Congressional hearings on Morocco coincide with growing
                            public interest in the North African situation and gives us a chance to
                            make a helpful move vis-a-vis Morocco in particular and our interests in
                            the area in general. (C)</p>
                        <p>In my view, the cumulative impact of these developments is bringing
                            Morocco to a point where, more than any other time since the Western
                            Sahara conflict began, the possibility of some meaningful compromise
                            (i.e., willingness to negotiate a political solution) may exist. In
                            order to negotiate, however, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> will have to do so from a position of perceived
                            strength rather than weakness. (C)</p>
                        <p>The OV–10 could be a major factor in that perception. As <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG_1">Gary Sick</persName> has argued, we would have to
                            accompany the provision of that equipment with a number of clear
                            assertions, among them: (a) we do not believe Morocco can achieve a
                            military solution, with or without the <pb n="430" facs="0451"
                                xml:id="pg_430"/>aircraft; (b) the aircraft are intended to improve
                            Morocco’s negotiating position; and (c) we continue to care how Morocco
                            uses the arms we provide (the misuse of which would be a hindrance to
                            our good relationship). We would, of course, approach the Algerians and
                            explain the OV–10 supply on the grounds of the Polisario’s more
                            aggressive posture, reiterating the need for a negotiation between
                            Maghrebian neighbors to resolve a no-win situation. (C)</p>
                        <p>In short, the sale of OV–10 to Morocco can be used to help nudge Morocco
                            into a more favorable negotiating frame of mind. There are, of course,
                            risks: <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, in refusing or
                            simply ignoring our strictures, could get the idea that we are ready to
                            help him fight to the bitter end, in which case the OV–10 would simply
                            embolden him on his military course. Moreover, we should be very clear
                            that these aircraft will perform no miracles, either militarily or
                            politically; still less can they provide a solution to Morocco’s larger
                            problems of economic management and leadership. At the very least,
                            however, they can remove a major irritant in our relationship which has
                            taken on some adversely symbolic value in a country where symbolism is
                            all-important. The sale would provide a tangible and much desired
                            earnest of our friendship and preclude (in the event of military
                            catastrophe) any plausible claim that we denied Morocco, in its hour of
                            need, the one piece of equipment they most required. (C)</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee met on September 20, 1979, to
                            consider U.S. arms transfer policy to Morocco and the general situation
                            in northwest Africa. This meeting was held in response to your
                            Administration’s request for the Committee’s advice on this matter.</p>
                        <p>After a thorough discussion of the issues, the Committee came to the
                            following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>(1) The United States should reaffirm its strong disposition in favor of
                            a negotiated settlement to the Saharan conflict and should begin a
                            concerted diplomatic initiative to find a negotiated settlement.</p>
                        <p>(2) The United States should appoint a seasoned American ambassador to
                            Morocco of the kind most suitable to open communications again between
                            the United States and King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(3) The United States should furnish Morocco with weapons suitable for
                            the defense of that country and as an expression of support for the
                            Moroccan Government. These weapons should be furnished for the defense
                            of Morocco, but we recognize that such weapons might be used in the
                            Saharan conflict.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">An unknown hand
                                highlighted this sentence.</note> The United States should make it
                            clear that provisions of these weapons is not an American endorsement of
                            Morocco’s policy in the Sahara and therefore the United States should
                            not provide weapons that would be suitable only for counterinsurgency
                            operations in the Western Sahara.<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">An unknown

                        <p>The Committee unanimously supported the first two findings above and
                            approved the third by a vote of 6 to 3 with one abstention.</p>
                        <p>The Committee also wishes to express its satisfaction at the way in which
                            your Administration conducted consultations on this matter.</p>

                            full U.S. assistance. According to Naif, Fahd wants to know as soon as

                            stocks. Naif indicated that Saudi Arabia is prepared to pay the costs

                        <p>I have been deeply concerned about the intensified military pressures you
                            and your country have been facing in recent months. This situation is
                            increasingly threatening to Morocco and to the stability of the region.
                            As you know, I have decided on certain changes in our policies governing
                            sales of military equipment to your armed forces which are designed to
                            help you meet the immediate military situation.<note n="2"

                        <p>It is important that we be in close communication at this juncture. In
                            particular, I am anxious to consider with you the scope of my decision,
                            the purposes it is designed to serve, and how we may best proceed to
                            implement it.</p>

                            replacements for what the Moroccans had already lost. In our
                            inter-agency proceedings since then that number tended to assume a
                            magical character; there are now, however, persuasive technical,
                            financial, and political reasons which make it advisable in my judgment
                            to adjust that total upward to 20: (C)</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Technical</hi>. The Moroccans have F–5s in the earlier
                            A and B models, which Northrop no longer makes. Replacements in whatever
                            quantity would be from newer E and F models, and the Air Force has
                            convinced me (and State) that a mixture of systems would be
                            operationally very bad, especially from a maintenance support
                            standpoint. (C)</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Financial</hi>. The Saudis are willing to finance a
                            total F–5 replacement program of 20 aircraft (making a full squadron);
                            however, given their emphasis on urgent supply, State does not believe
                            that Saudi financing will be available in two or more tranches (in other
                            words, if we limited ourselves to 8 now, we have no assurance that we
                            could secure financing for more at a later date, whereas they agree to
                            underwrite all 20 right now). (C)</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Political</hi>. There are indications that the
                            Moroccans may not wish to take any F–5s if they are held to a
                            complicated mixed-system set-<pb n="436" facs="0457" xml:id="pg_436"
                            />up; if that happens, the overall size of the package would be very
                            modest (a difference roughly between $250 million and $73 million); and
                            while the two situations are not organically related (and should not
                            be), I am concerned how an overly modest arms package—our first in
                            1980—will play in terms of the public post-Afghanistan stance we want to
                            project. (C)</p>
                        <p>There are two major question-marks connected with an upward adjustment,
                            and both have been answered to my satisfaction:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Congressional Support</hi>. State’s own legislative
                            people—are you ready for this?—are confident that Congress will go along
                            with it. <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1">Solarz</persName> and McGovern
                            will bitch, but they will do so in any event, and regardless of the
                            initial package’s composition. State also feels that it is much better
                            to go in for a total now, rather than coming back with an additional
                            request when and if we think circumstances warrant. (C)</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Conditionality</hi>. The experts in both <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> and State assure me that we can retain
                            full control over the pace of delivery and that if <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has not been sufficiently
                            forthcoming on the political negotiation track, we will preserve enough
                            flexibility in the mechanics of the supply to slow it down, or suspend
                            it altogether. (C)</p>

                            the upward adjustment, which does not violate the President’s decision
                            in any way (no specific number was ever cited in the decision memo,<note

                            “replacements” since Morocco would agree to remove their older F–5
                            models—which I understand are in pretty sorry shape in any event). I
                            would like to tell Hal that we support this too, which will undoubtedly
                            determine <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s

                            being readied for formal Congressional notification this week should
                            include 20 F–5 aircraft. It is understood that provision of all 20
                            aircraft to Morocco is conditional upon Moroccan progress toward a

                        <p>2. The Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS_1">JCS</gloss>, General
                            Davey Jones, asked me to let you know of a conversation which he had
                            with Colonel Kabbaj, Chief of the Moroccan Air Force, during his visit
                            here. Davey asked Colonel Kabbaj—explicitly stating that he was not
                            asking for anything—what the Colonel thought the Moroccan Government’s
                            view would be if the <pb n="439" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_439"/>U.S. asked
                            Morocco for use of military facilities in Morocco in connection with
                            trouble that we might have with the Soviet Union in the Middle East.
                            Colonel Kabbaj on the spot responded unequivocally that we could use
                            Moroccan facilities for that purpose and would be welcome to send a
                            survey team to Morocco to determine what facilities would be available
                            in relation to possible U.S. needs. The Colonel then said that he would
                            consult with King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, and
                            General Jones said that he was not asking for that right now. The
                            Colonel said that he was going to do it anyway and came back a day later
                            with confirmation, reportedly from the King, of his position. Colonel
                            Kabbaj had one request—if we begin talking formally with the Government
                            of Morocco on this subject, that you talk directly and only with the
                            King in the first instance and not with the Foreign Ministry.</p>

                            at this point. We simply want to alert you to this background of any

                            subject comes up in any way that requires discussion with the Moroccan
                            Government before you receive instructions, you talk in the first
                            instance only with the King.</p>

                                Rabat, January 23, the Department addressed the need for long-term
                                planning for military access in light of the potential for regional
                                instability in Southwest Asia and Soviet involvement in regional
                                conflicts: “The great distances and the need for timely response
                                will place extraordinary demands on our total resources. It is
                                essential that we gain the cooperation of those countries which lie

                                or overflight permission.” The Department requested an in-house

                        <p>2. This Country Team assessment considers the background of our military
                            relationship with Morocco and the likely political context in which the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> would consider a <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> request for access and/or overflights;
                            the Moroccan logistical and support infrastructure and potential, and

                        <p>3. Background and political considerations</p>
                        <p>A. Our “military relationship” with Morocco dates from the landings in
                            World War II. Following the closure of our <gloss target="#t_SAC_1"
                                >SAC</gloss> bases in 1963, the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            Navy maintained significant communications and support facilities (and
                            some training for the Moroccans) under a “handshake agreement” until, at
                            USN initiative, they were closed as redundant in 1978. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> airlifted many of Moroccan forces
                            participating in Morocco’s two interventions in Shaba, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> on short notice permitted the
                            refueling here of some of the F–15 aircraft returning from their
                            demonstration sortie to Saudi Arabia in 1979, when our European allies
                            did not appear very receptive. Several years ago King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> came close to offering us
                            additional facilities (e.g. Mediterranean submarine bases) in implicit
                            return for stronger <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> support for
                            Morocco. This country opens its ports to <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> Naval NPW and conventional ship visits. On the military
                            assistance side the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has furnished
                            approximately $533 million worth of grant and <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> equipment during the past 21 years, and remains
                            Morocco’s second most important source of arms.</p>
                        <p>B. The above having been said, however, there has been a fairly steady
                            erosion in King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s
                            readiness to accommodate our numerous requests for unrequited favors,
                            reflecting the tremendous growth in the importance of the Sahara issue
                            and our failure fully to support his position. Also playing a role is
                            his increasingly restricted room for maneuver in terms of domestic
                            political realities. Indeed our request three years ago to establish a
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss> GEODSS (deep space optical
                            tracking) facility has effectively been shelved following an initial
                            acceptance in principle (perhaps significantly, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> had particular difficulty with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF_1">USAF</gloss>’s insistence on legal status
                            and a written agreement, the antithesis of the USN’s successful use of
                            the “handshake agreement” formula). Since late 1977 the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> unwillingness to sell much of the
                            equipment sought by Morocco for its fight with the Polisario has
                            burdened our relations. The recent Presidential decision to remove
                            restrictions on a limited amount of equipment has lightened the load to
                            some degree, but it will require more to convince King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> that the costs of a clear
                            alignment with the United States will be offset by a steady, long-term
                            commitment to Morocco’s security as Morocco defines it.</p>
                        <p>C. History, conscious choice, and to a degree Western policies have
                            coalesced to encourage Morocco’s role as associate of the West. Yet
                            first and foremost it is a Third World nation, member of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAM_1">NAM</gloss>, and Arab League stalwart. While
                            Morocco’s affinity for the West has <pb n="441" facs="0462"
                                xml:id="pg_441"/>often given it a useful private and sometimes
                            public role, this sentiment has not been enough to engage Morocco in the
                            full responsibilities of a <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> ally.</p>
                        <p>D. Beyond a strong but amorphous attachment to its Arab, African, and
                            Third World “vocation”, Morocco’s nominally non-aligned stance results
                            from a practical assessment of its long-term interests. In the past
                            Saudi Arabia has provided, for example, relatively massive financial
                            assistance; the lesser Gulf states, sometimes constrained to appear less
                            steadily pro-American, have come through with vital development funds.
                            Morocco’s reluctance to identify fully with the West has also made
                            possible its reasonably good relations with states as diverse and
                            influential as Iraq and Guinea. A key consideration across the board is
                            Morocco’s desire to obstruct Algerian attempts to build a solid
                            Arab/African front against it on the all-embracing issue of the Sahara.
                            Finally in domestic terms, Morocco’s Third World vocation, Arab
                            credentials and steady support of the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> have largely insulated the King, the ultimate
                            decision-maker, on the issue of strategic cooperation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> now before us, from important domestic
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>E. In considering a firm commitment to strategic cooperation with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> would have to balance the
                            considerable concrete interests devolving from its present stance
                            against the compensation which that cooperation would bring. This does
                            not mean that we will not receive “signals” of Morocco’s readiness to
                            furnish us access and overflights, but it does mean we should weigh
                            these indications carefully.</p>
                        <p>4. Morocco’s logistical and support capability:</p>
                        <p>A. There are numerous airfields or air bases in Morocco which could
                            accommodate the support of a deployment force. Depending on the nature,
                            magnitude and duration of the airlift, several are naturally more
                            advantageous than others. Assuming the deployment aircraft to be of the
                            C–141, C–5 and KC–135 type, the following airfields could be utilized:
                            Agadir/Inezgane, Casablanca/Nouasseur, Fes/Saiss, Kenitra,
                            Marrakech/Menara, Meknes/Basantine, Oujda/Angad, Rabat/Sale, Sidi
                            Slimane and Tangier/Boukhalf. Each of these airfields differs in its
                            capability to provide support. Except for an extremely limited
                            deployment operation the more readily discernible problem areas would
                            include: fuel availability, runway bearing capacity, aircraft parking
                            facilities, aircraft servicing, maintenance support, aircraft support
                            equipment, fire and crash equipment, billeting and messing facilities,
                            radar capability and runway length during summer operations. Many of
                            these could be surmounted through United States logistical support.
                            However, unless long term construction improvements are made the main
                            problems confronting a large scale deployment are fuel availability and
                            aircraft parking space. At present Morocco distributes fuel to <pb
                                n="442" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_442"/>virtually all its airfields by
                            truck from Casablanca. This is a very slow process which would
                            proportionately hinder support as the distance from Casablanca to the
                            selected airfield increases. Morocco does have a fairly extensive
                            petroleum pipeline which connects Casablanca to several airfields.
                            However, this pipeline has been deactivated, and it is not known whether
                            reactivation is feasible. Aircraft parking space is also a major
                            problem, for the only airfields constructed to accommodate large number
                            of aircraft are the former Strategic Air Command bases at
                            Casablanca/Nouasseur, Sidi Slimane and Ben Guerir (now essentially
                            deactivated).</p>
                        <p>B. In discussing Morocco’s capability to provide support for a
                            deployment, certain assumptions must be made and various scenarios
                            envisioned:</p>
                        <p>—Limited support—If it is envisioned that Moroccan airfields be used
                            solely for transiting aircraft to obtain fuel for minor maintenance and
                            for aircrew changes we think that approximately ten aircraft per day
                            could be accommodated at any of the above airfields. This would tax the
                            Moroccan capability to provide fuel over an extended period to those
                            airfields more distant from Casablanca. However it could be accomplished
                            with existing assets and a dedicated effort by the Moroccans and with
                            the proviso that large numbers of aircraft would not be on the airfield
                            at the same time. For this limited support, optimum bases would be
                            Casablanca/Nouasseur, Rabat/Sale and Kenitra to facilitate fuel
                            delivery.</p>
                        <p>—Moderate support—Transiting of Moroccan airfields by ten to twenty
                            aircraft per day for fuel, minor maintenance and aircrew changes. Based
                            on the present fuel distribution procedures it is envisioned that only
                            Casablanca/Nouasseur could accommodate our requirement. However, this
                            would not preclude use of Casablanca/Nouasseur in conjunction with one
                            or more additional airfields. This also assumes that over an extended
                            period fuel deliveries to Casablanca would be increased.</p>
                        <p>—Heavy support—Transiting of Moroccan airfields by more than twenty
                            aircraft per day for fuel, maintenance, crew rest, aircrew changes and
                            aircraft parking. This scenario over an extended period would require a
                            major effort to upgrade the present Moroccan fuel distribution system.
                            Consideration would have to be given to the use of truck, rail, air, sea
                            and/or reactivation of the petroleum pipeline and also evaluation of the
                            suitability of fuel storage facilities at Casablanca/Nouasseur and Sidi
                            Slimane and Ben Guerir. Although deactivated, consideration may be given
                            to use of Ben Guerir if the necessary repairs are feasible.</p>
                        <p>—Air refueling support—Any of the aforementioned bases could also be
                            utilized as staging bases for aerial tanker aircraft. This, however, <pb
                                n="443" facs="0464" xml:id="pg_443"/>would also be subject to the
                            fuel and aircraft parking limitations previously mentioned. As one can
                            readily see, the range of options available in Morocco depends greatly
                            on the type of support required and the extent of any improvements in
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>—Other military considerations—There are several other possibilities
                            which might be discussed such as use of Moroccan airspace or landing
                            beaches for training. Staging of grand forces moving forward to SW Asia
                            in ports is also a possibility.</p>
                        <p>5. Conclusions:</p>
                        <p>A. The range of possible scenarios is virtually infinite. Thus the
                            comments below are keyed to the increasing level of involvement which
                            might be required. While Morocco may provide signals of receptivity to
                            approaches, we should not forget that somewhere on the scale the burden
                            on Morocco’s other interests becomes very heavy. Virtually no form of
                            cooperation, moreover, will be palatable that could identify the use of
                            Morocco for moves perceived to be helpful to Israel or as attacking
                            another Arab or even non-Arab Islamic country.</p>
                        <p>B. Simple overflight requests should pose few problems. Neither should
                            the simple transit/refueling of manageable numbers of aircraft. Neither
                            would necessarily imply a direct quid pro quo.</p>
                        <p>C. If our goal is truly “dependable access to transit and refueling” at
                            anywhere near the scope suggested <gloss target="#t_reftel_1"
                                >reftel</gloss> things become more difficult. Realistically, a firm
                            Moroccan promise to allow large-scale <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            access and transit would almost certainly require (1) a clear definition
                            of purposes for which transiting American forces would ultimately be
                            used, and (2) a substantial (albeit maybe implicit) <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> commitment to Morocco’s own security,
                            quite possibly including assistance in defense of its Sahara claims.
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> costs for Morocco’s long-term
                            strategic cooperation—and that is how “dependable access to (large
                            scale) transit and refueling” directed at global trouble spots would be
                            interpreted—would have to offset the large costs to Morocco which that
                            cooperation would bring: A relinquishing of non-aligned credentials,
                            strong internal criticism, exposure to Soviet pressures, weakening ties
                            with Arab regimes donor and otherwise, who are now at odds with the
                            United States or might be at some time in the future. The prospect of
                            extracting untrammeled <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> support in
                            Morocco’s Sahara claims might well be too tempting for the Moroccans to
                            ignore. Moroccans have convinced themselves firmly that defense of their
                            Saharan claims equates to defense of their national security, and indeed
                            the outcome of the Sahara war is vital to the future of King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, whose decision would define
                            the Moroccan position. (3) And, quite possibly, willingness to undertake
                            long sought-after, concrete U.S. assistance programs that would allow
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> to deal meaningfully with a

                        </opener>
                        <p>It was just about a year ago that your decision on arms sales to Morocco
                            was made known, and your appointment of me to implement that policy soon
                            followed. As we reach this first anniversary, it might be useful to

                        <p>I am convinced that a process leading to a negotiated settlement of the
                            Saharan war has begun and that your policy decision has directly
                            contributed to much of the progress made so far.</p>
                        <p>Because of the leverage the new policy has given us, our bilateral
                            relations have been productive, our views are carefully and cordially
                            considered, and I have been enabled to make the point that we agreed to
                            sell arms in order to ensure Moroccan engagement in the approach to a
                            settlement which is sufficiently satisfactory all around to endure and
                            enhance regional security.</p>

                        <p>The evidence of progress so far is as follows: last year Morocco refused
                            to attend the Monrovia <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Conference;
                            this September at Freetown it agreed for the first time to meet with
                            “all interested parties” and was represented at the Prime Ministerial
                                level.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d45fn4"

                                >OAU</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> help. The

                            maintain that because the Saharans under their flag made their choice
                            known in 1975 through their provincial assembly and in several local
                            elections since, a referendum is unnecessary. Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>, however, has indicated
                            privately a good deal more flexibility in his government’s position on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The Algerians, who, in my opinion, have thus far been an obstacle to
                            negotiations, have recently shown indications of increased understanding
                            that our arms sales agreement is designed to enlist the participation of
                            all parties in the search for peace. Although Algeria still maintains it
                            is not involved, it seems to be more interested than before in being
                            able to turn its undivided attention to its Eastern Flank.</p>
                        <p>All of the parties are now engaged, and I am convinced that they have
                            been caught up in a momentum that could well lead to a negotiated
                            settlement. As one who is associated with the implementation of your
                            policy, I wish to bear witness to its promising results and to express
                            total support for its continuance in your next administration.</p>

                        <p>1. In April 12–14 visit to Tunis, Under Secretary <persName

                            Belkhodja and SecState for Foreign Affairs Turki. Discussions focused on

                                >FonMin</gloss> all urged U.S. to play active role in finding
                            peaceful Middle East settlement. In their view, solution to Palestinian
                            question is of overriding importance if settlement is to be achieved;
                            they stressed importance of Palestinian representation at Geneva and
                            separate Palestinian state. However, they had no clear ideas to offer on
                            manner in which Palestinians should be represented at Geneva. They
                            clearly supported separate Palestinian state and were unenthusiastic
                            about Palestinian association with Jordan.</p>

                            at request of the Secretary with area’s leaders. Secretary had travelled

                            meetings and after Israeli elections, Secretary hopes to make another
                            trip to Middle East to explore views further. U.S. role is to facilitate
                            the resolution of differences between opposing sides. Continuing U.S.
                            discussions with Middle East leaders are intended to narrow differences
                            between confrontation states in order to make progress toward peaceful
                            settlement and convene Geneva Conference, hopefully before end of 1977.
                            Extensive preparations are essential to ensure success at Geneva.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> stressed that U.S. had
                            no current plan for settlement but is trying to get interested parties
                            to consider possible solutions to key outstanding areas of disagreement.
                            For Israel the nature of peace is most important, while for Arabs border
                            and Palestinian questions have highest priority. He asked for Tunisian
                            support for U.S. diplomatic efforts to achieve peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> briefly reviewed
                            history of Tunisia’s Middle East policy, dating from his 1965 Jericho
                                speech.<note n="5" xml:id="d188fn5">In his March 3, 1965, speech,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> advocated a
                                two-state solution for a lasting peace between Israelis and
                                Palestinians.</note> He confessed to considerable pride in fact that
                            all other Arab states, who had ostracized him once, had now come around
                            to his concept of peaceful resolution in ME. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName>
                            agreed with <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> that present
                            conditions augur well for urgent efforts to achieve peaceful resolution
                            of Arab-Israeli questions. <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            needs peace in order to concentrate on economic development and Egypt,
                            Syria and Israel all find cost of defense establishments burdensome.
                            They stressed importance of settling as many questions as possible
                            before Geneva Conference formally convenes because of extreme difficulty
                            in reconvening should conference fail to achieve settlement. In
                            discussion of Palestinian question, <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                >Chatty</persName> suggested that Israeli security would be enhanced
                            by separate Palestinian and Jordanian states rather than by
                            confederation or similar unitary state. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1"
                                >Habib</persName> pointed out that Israel remained opposed to
                            independent, <pb n="450" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_450"/>probably strongly
                            irredentist Palestinian state between itself and Jordan.</p>
                        <p>5. Africa: Current developments in Africa were also examined at length.
                            Tunisian leaders are very concerned over continuing increase in Soviet
                            influence in Africa both directly and by means of Cuban surrogates. They
                            stressed importance of the U.S. playing a direct role in Africa. In
                            their view, no other Western country has as much influence throughout
                            the continent as the U.S. They expressed full approval of
                            Moroccan-French action re Zaire and strongly encouraged U.S. to provide
                            more support and play stronger role in Zaire and elsewhere in
                            Africa.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> asked President for his
                            views on current deterioration in Africa below Sahara. President
                            launched into discourse on Soviet machinations in Africa, citing
                            Podgorny visits, Soviet fleet activities, and Castro travels. He blamed
                            American “Vietnam complex” for lack of firm U.S. hand in Africa. He made
                            strong plea for U.S. to make its weight felt on this continent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> assured President that
                            sincere and positive U.S. policy would be followed in Africa, but noted
                            American desire to feel that Africans themselves wanted American
                            presence and were willing to do their share in their own interest.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> assured <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> that, among African states,
                            perhaps all but the few “Marxist” radicals wanted the U.S. and friendly
                            Western nations to concern themselves with African affairs.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> reviewed U.S. policy in
                            Zaire, Rhodesia, Namibia and Ethiopia. He stressed U.S. support for
                            African nationalism and encouragement of African states to work together
                            against external intervention.</p>
                        <p>8. Libya: Tunisian leaders were especially concerned about Soviet
                            influence in Libya and unpredictable, aggressive nature of <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> regime, particularly toward
                            Tunisia. While Tunisia would prefer to devote its limited resources to
                            economic development, heavy Libyan purchases of modern Soviet arms,
                            including MiGs and submarines, have forced Tunisia to undertake its own
                            defense modernization program. Tunisia has turned to France, U.S., and
                            Italy for arms.</p>
                        <p>9. Describing continental shelf dispute as serious, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> emphasized <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>’s refusal to use <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss> or alternatives to arbitrate dispute.
                            Tunisia is fully prepared to submit matter to arbitration by either
                            appropriate organizations or technical experts. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> assured <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> that U.S. will support Tunisian
                            efforts to achieve peaceful resolution of shelf question.<note n="6"

                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> told <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> during March 29 Tobruk meeting offered Tunisians
                            loan of 20 million dinars per year for next four years for economic
                            development. <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> undertook to
                            discuss offer with his government, but asked how Tunisia could be
                            expected to live continually in fear of Libyan invasion while taking
                            handout from <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> saw this as an effort to

                            situation. He undertook, upon return to Washington, to review latest

                            continental shelf issue in any detail with Tunisians, calling it “too
                            complex” and of no direct interest to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"

                            Tunisia wishes to acquire under <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>.
                            Tunisian armed forces require upgrading and modernization to defend
                            against possible threats from better armed neighbors Algeria and Libya.
                            Current disagreement with Libya over continental shelf underscores
                            urgency of Tunisia’s military equipment needs. Tunisia therefore hopes
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> can provide $125 million in

                                >USG</gloss> does not usually sell Redeye because of concern it may

                                >Farhat</persName> also discussed U.S. policy on Security Supporting

                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName> also deplored current
                            U.S. policy of charging <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> recipients
                            for replacement costs of equipment, citing case of Chaparral/Vulcan
                            system. <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> is being charged $65,356

                            which they understand was considerably less. Even with modest size of
                            desired system, Tunisia is being impoverished by such policies.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> was not sure if

                        <p>4. We also informed the Tunisians of the 28-month delivery schedule in
                            their Chaparral buy (vice 30 months). General <persName

                            realize their much needed defense requirements.</p>
                        <p>7. The Tunisians took the opportunity to outline to us some of their
                            out-year military hardware requirements such as two missile and M48A5
                            tanks. With good financial planning based on the news of credit
                            availability, the Tunisians will be well on the road to achieving their

                        </list>
                        <p>This memorandum asks you to exercise your authority under section 33(b)
                            of the Arms Export Control Act to waive the $40 million statutory
                            ceiling on the total (excluding training) of grant military assistance
                            and foreign military sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>)
                            credits and guaranteed loans to African countries in fiscal year 1977.
                            The waiver of the ceiling is urgently needed to permit implementation of
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing programs, especially
                            to make progress payments on prior purchases.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>Section 33 (a) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, imposes an
                            annual $40 million ceiling on military assistance and <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> financing for African countries.
                            Section 33 (b) of the Act provides that you may waive this ceiling when
                            you determine that a waiver is important to the security of the United
                            States, and promptly so report to the Congress.</p>
                        <p>The $40 million ceiling has ceased to be a realistic limitation and has
                            been waived successively in recent years. Last year, the Ford
                            Administration justified to Congress <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>
                            1977 security assistance programs for Africa which exceeded the $40
                            million ceiling by more than $60 million. In North Africa alone our
                            program justifications for Morocco and Tunisia exceed the ceiling.
                            Subsequent reprogramming has only slightly increased the total African
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Although Congress declined last year to repeal the ceiling, it approved
                            the requested funding levels. This Congressional action appears to
                            assume that the ceiling again will be waived. Congress, therefore,
                            should expect you to waive this limitation in order to implement country
                            programs at the levels it has approved. We will report your
                            determination to Congress on your behalf and provide it with the
                            attached justification,<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Not attached.</note>
                            as has been the practice with previous determinations.</p>

                            financing in Africa for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1977 consists
                            of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> programs for seven
                            countries—Zaire, Senegal, Liberia, Gabon, Kenya, Morocco, and Tunisia.
                            These programs total about $108.5 million.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Control Considerations</p>
                        <p>The waiving of the $40 million African ceiling will not conflict with
                            your recently announced policy to restrain conventional arms transfers.
                            The <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1977 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> financing programs for African countries will be used
                            to finance purchases of defense articles and services by countries whose
                            defense is important to the security of the United States and whose
                            unfriendly neighbors are armed with superior weapons. Consequently, the
                            sales which result from waiving this $40 million ceiling should not
                            adversely affect regional distributions of power or promote arms races
                            in Africa.</p>

                        <p>This determination is necessary, since the Administration’s proposed 1977
                            budget levels for the eight African countries exceed $40 million, and
                            the Congress has not agreed to eliminate the ceiling provision in
                            current security assistance legislation.</p>
                        <p>By approving this determination and transmitting the required
                            justifications to Congress, you would also be approving an increase in

                            from the budgeted $15 million to $25 million. The amounts shown for all
                            other planned country programs in the attached table<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d191fn3">Not attached.</note> were previously approved and
                            reflected in the 1978 Congressional Presentation document.<note n="4"

                        <p>The Tunisian increase would be used to accelerate delivery of the
                            integrated air defense system (Chaparral missile batteries, radar, and
                            Vulcan anti-aircraft guns) which Tunisia has begun purchasing to meet
                            what it perceives to be an increased threat from Libya. This increase
                            for Tunisia is not likely to raise questions about your overall policy
                            of restraint in arms transfers, since the 1978 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1"
                                >FMS</gloss> credit program nearing final approval by the Congress

                            Determination (at Tab A) to waive the $40 million statutory ceiling on
                            the total (excluding training) of grant military assistance and foreign
                            military sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>) credits and

                                >FY</gloss> 1977. This waiver will permit implementation of <gloss

                            progress payments on prior purchases. The Act permits you to waive the
                            ceiling when you determine that a waiver is important to <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> security, and promptly so report to the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>The $40 million ceiling has ceased to be a realistic limitation and has
                            been waived successively in recent years. There is strong indication
                            that Congress assumes that the ceiling will again be waived. Our planned

                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 77 totals about $108.5 million.</p>
                        <p>Your waiver of this ceiling will not conflict with our policy of
                            restraining conventional arms transfers. The Secretary of State will
                            report your Determination of Waiver to Congress on your behalf and

                            unlikely to raise questions on the overall arms transfers policy, since
                            the 1978 <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit program includes
                            $25 million for Tunisia. Accordingly, if you agree, your approval of

                            remarked that the U.S. Sixth Fleet had previously studied possibility of
                            using Menzel-<persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> dockyard
                            facilities but never responded to <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            on outcome. He reiterated <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> strong
                            preference for Sixth Fleet utilization of dockyard facilities instead of
                            Soviets. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> noted U.S.
                            concern that Soviet fleet repairs in Menzel-<persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> dockyards increase Soviet capability in
                            Mediterranean area, which is not in U.S. interest. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> said we would look into
                            possibility of Sixth Fleet usage of Menzel-<persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> facilities.</p>
                        <p>6. Regarding <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> visit,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> relayed preference for
                            January–March 1978 period. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>
                            said he was also in favor of this timing and would try to get an answer
                            on request shortly.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> then requested a briefing
                            on the U.S. position on the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> described U.S.
                            position regarding Somalia and Ethiopia. He said Somalis had approached
                            U.S. to replace Soviet military assistance. U.S. agreed in principle to
                            supply Somalis with defensive arms, but, since inception of Ogaden
                            conflict, U.S. had informed Somalia that we would not provide arms to
                            Somalia <pb n="461" facs="0482" xml:id="pg_461"/>so long as Ogaden
                            conflict remains unresolved. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1"
                                >Habib</persName> said U.S. had decided not to get in Ogaden
                            dispute. At this time, therefore, we are not providing arms to either
                            side. We do have some ongoing economic assistance programs in Ethiopia
                            and we are preparing to have some economic assistance programs as well
                            with Somalia.</p>
                        <p>8. Regarding Middle East conflict, <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1"
                                >Habib</persName> noted the next few weeks will be significant. U.S.
                            is still hopeful a Geneva Conference will be held by end of year and
                            will try to get all parties to agree.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> said Secretary would
                            appreciate Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"

                                that it might be best to put off Joint Commission dates until early
                                in 1978.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,

                            <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> said he would like to
                            discuss only one major bilateral concern with the Secretary, before
                            turning to multilateral matters. <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                >Chatty</persName> said that the Tunisian Government sets great
                            store by its relations with the U.S., which are exceptional and of a
                            very special nature. Thanks to the U.S. Tunisia has reached a stage
                            close to economic take-off. However, it now needs an extra boost, and
                            the U.S. could provide this in the form of Security Supporting
                                Assistance.<note n="3" xml:id="d194fn3">Originally known as Defense
                                Support Assistance, Security Supporting Assistance was a form of
                                military aid that allowed recipients to purchase arms without using
                                their own resources. In 1978, it was renamed the Economic Support
                                Fund.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> recalled that he had
                            discussed this with the previous Administration.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> said his rationale for
                            renewing the request for Security Supporting Assistance derives from
                            Tunisia’s unique geographic situation. Together with Morocco, Egypt,
                            Kuwait, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, Tunisia helps to serve as a buffer
                            between the two great power blocs, but it is the weakest link in the
                            chain—weaker even than the Sudan. This had been brought home with
                            particular starkness during the confrontation with Libya. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CH_1">Chatty</persName> said this was the only major
                            bilateral issue he wanted to bring up. Other issues could be discussed
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> in the context of
                            the U.S.-Tunisian Joint Commission. He added that the Secretary might
                            want to take some time to think about his proposal. If it was not
                            possible for Tunisia to have Security Supporting Assistance, he hoped
                            that economic assistance and military sales credits could be increased,
                            for the same reasons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> said that we
                            share the view that relations between our two countries are of great
                            importance, and that we must maintain and strengthen them. He said that
                            we were planning to continue our economic assistance, within the limit
                            of funds available, at approximately the current level.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Security Supporting Assistance, the Secretary said that we
                            would be willing to explore the matter once more, but his initial
                            reaction was that the Tunisian interest would not be served by this type
                            of aid. We were already getting increasingly penetrating questions from
                            Congress about the large share of total assistance that goes into
                            Security Supporting Assistance. In Tunisia’s case, the question might
                                <pb n="463" facs="0484" xml:id="pg_463"/>be put to an up or down
                            vote in Congress, which would be risky. He asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> for his view on the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> agreed that Tunisia
                            does not fit in the category that would appeal to Congress for Security
                            Supporting Assistance. He said that we have set a target for military
                            assistance, and that we are looking for ways to increase our economic
                            assistance. The Secretary concluded that Security Supporting Assistance
                            was not a favorable avenue for Tunisia to pursue. He asked what
                            Tunisia’s immediate needs were, what total amount of assistance was at
                            stake, and in what time frame. <persName corresp="#p_CH_1"
                                >Chatty</persName> replied that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> could follow-up with precise
                            figures. The important thing to keep in mind was that Tunisia receives
                            economic support from many countries, but that U.S. support has always
                            been a key factor. Other countries follow the U.S. lead. U.S. aid is
                            doubly important; first, for the amount of aid itself; second, because
                            of the example the U.S. sets for others. A U.S. decision to discontinue
                            assistance would be little short of disastrous for Tunisia. The

                        <p>1. Summary: On January 7 I was summoned by Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs Turki and given a strong demarche regarding U.S. attitude on
                            Soviet fleet repairs at Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> arising from recent <gloss
                                target="#t_NEAAFN_1">NEA/AFN</gloss> discussion with Tunisian
                            Charge. Turki said he believed U.S. under erroneous impression Soviet
                            use of Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> based on
                            accord, agreement or contract of formal written nature, which he denied.
                            He reiterated known <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> position and
                            repeated regret U.S. <pb n="464" facs="0485" xml:id="pg_464"/>and
                            Western allies have failed to avail selves of repeated <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> offers to use repair facilities. He
                            stressed apparent lack of congressional opposition to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> exemplified in attitudes of HIRC
                            Chairman Zablocki and others during recent Tunis visit. In response I
                            restated our basic dissatisfaction with fact that Tunisia was now,
                            however unwittingly, contributing to the increased operational
                            capability of the Soviet Mediterranean fleet. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. With apologies for bothering me on a Saturday, Brahim Turki, Secretary
                            of State for Foreign Affairs, asked me to come to <gloss
                                target="#t_MOFA_1">MOFA</gloss> urgently. Upon arrival I found him
                            in unusually cool mood. He launched at once into an expression of
                            “astonishment” over the contents of recent report from Tunisian Charge
                            d’Affaires Tekaya on the subject of Soviet fleet repairs at Menzel
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> following talk with
                                <gloss target="#t_AFN_1">AFN</gloss> Director. <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> was “astonished” that <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is still apparently under the
                            misapprehension that <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> has concluded
                            a formal written accord, agreement or contract with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> regarding the use of ship repair
                            facilities at Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>.
                            Tunisian “astonishment” (a word repeated at least five times during our
                            talk) is all the greater because <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>,
                            from the first time U.S. raised this subject, has made a clean breast of
                            its motivations—purely economic and “sociological”—in agreeing on
                            case-by-case basis to allow repairs of “a non-military character” to be
                            made at Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> by
                            Soviet ships. He stated he was at Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>’s side all during his 1977 visit
                            to <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and could assure me that
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> use of Menzel <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> is based entirely on simple
                            oral agreement by <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> who
                            stipulated that repairs would be agreed to on a case-by-case basis and
                            must not be of a military character. Each case is subject to specific
                            examination and approval by the Minister of Defense, who, said Turki,
                            has rejected as many applications as he has approved over past six
                            months. He especially stressed the fact that the Soviets had never
                            sought any written agreement on use of the shipyard. Turki added that
                            the Soviet Ambassador has “pursued me by telephone even into my home”
                            pressing requests for facilities for individual ships which MOD has
                            either delayed action on or refused to admit.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary of State then reviewed the (to me) well-known story of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s 10–15 year effort to promote
                            Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s great
                            potential usefulness to the West: Bethlehem Steel’s long-studied and
                            finally negative decision in mid-1960’s not to invest in and upgrade
                            Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>; French refusal
                            to continue utilizing its facilities and a more recent Krupp decision
                            against participating there. He described the history of
                            post-independence Menzel <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> (formerly Ferryville) which once employed
                            3,000 workers and the economic disaster which has beset the community
                            since 1963, of the millions of dinars <pb n="465" facs="0486"
                                xml:id="pg_465"/>Tunisia has spent on make-work programs to keep
                            only 800 men and their families solvent. This closely followed the lines
                            of Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_FA_1">Farhat</persName>’s
                            exposition to CODEL Zablocki, which resulted in an expression of
                            understanding of the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> position from
                            the HIRC Chairman and no expression of opposition from other HIRC
                            members or staff present (<gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>).
                            Turki made much of this point and again expressed “astonishment” that
                            Tunisia’s motives were being called into question by Department, when
                            the U.S. above all others should know where Tunisia’s sympathies
                            lie.</p>
                        <p>4. After this, I said I appreciated, as did my government, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s courtesy and cooperation in

                        <p>5. In reply Turki said he knew of no other <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> country which had indicated its unhappiness over this

                            by saying that Tunisia, since independence, has always enjoyed a frank

                            consolidated its control of the government and can be expected to quell
                            forcibly any further disorders.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> government clearly
                            intends to use the recent outbreaks of violence to bring the labor
                            movement back under the effective control of the party and government.
                            Labor leader Achour will be made the scapegoat, but the political and
                            economic discontent basically responsible for the recent disturbances
                            will remain.</p>
                        <p>The January disorders reflect strong currents of discontent which have
                            been building over the years as a result of rapid economic, social, and
                            cultural changes. These changes have increased popular expectations
                            beyond the government’s capacity to satisfy them.</p>
                        <p>We expect that <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> will
                            continue as Prime Minister and will succeed <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>. Given his control of the government and party
                            apparatus, <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> will become
                            Tunisia’s president and would have a considerable advantage over other
                            contenders in a subsequent presidential election.</p>
                        <p>The departure of <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> will be
                            the acid test of Tunisia’s political stability. Greater reliance on
                            repressive measures over an extended period of time would erode the
                            successor leadership’s legitimacy and increase the risk that some group
                            within the military might eventually step in to form either a
                            conservative authoritarian regime or a reform-minded military
                            government.</p>
                        <p>We believe the military, whose support will become increasingly important
                            in the post-<persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> era, will
                            remain loyal to <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> or any
                            other legitimately constituted government. Although we lack good
                            information on the attitudes of junior officers, we judge the likelihood
                            of a <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName>-style coup attempt
                            by young officers espousing radical Arab sympathies as very remote.</p>
                        <p>We believe <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> and most leaders
                            of the political establishment probably recognize the dangers of a
                            long-term policy of repression. Over time, these leaders are likely to
                            seek a compromise with other moderate interest groups to preserve
                            Tunisia’s civilian-dominated political system.</p>
                        <p>Barring a sustained deterioration of the economy and/or prolonged civil
                            disorders, we believe that a moderate, pro-Western government is likely
                            to remain in power for the next three to five years.</p>
                        <p>Over the longer run, Tunisia could see the emergence of a regime that
                            would be less overtly pro-Western and more dogmatically nonaligned. Such
                            a regime probably would accelerate Tunisia’s drift away from close
                            identification with the United States.</p>
                        <p>We do not expect Tunisia to align itself with the <gloss

                            permitted greater access to ship repair facilities. It is unlikely that

                            ailing 74-year-old leader who has dominated Tunisian politics since the
                            struggle for independence against France, is nearing the end of his
                            rule. The government, the ruling Destourian Socialist Party (PSD), and
                            the national labor confeder<pb n="469" facs="0490" xml:id="pg_469"

                            erupt until after <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s
                            death.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s genius has been his
                            ability to make Tunisia’s closed one-party system work for nearly 22
                            years behind a democratic facade. He is the father of his country and
                            still enjoys a high level of popular support. The fruits of his
                            leadership have been a relatively high degree of political stability and
                            economic well-being. Under <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>’s leadership, Tunisia has maintained a

                        <p>3. His ruling style has been paternalistic, highly personal, and
                            autocratic. His stranglehold on power [<hi rend="italic">6 lines not

                            control over the government and party. He suffered a massive coronary

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Succession Politics</p>
                        <p>5. The overriding political issue in Tunisia is presidential succession.
                            For more than a decade <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            has vacillated over what procedures should be used to choose his
                            successor. This vacillation has encouraged political maneuvering by
                            those who see themselves as presidential material.</p>
                        <p>6. Tunisia’s constitution provides that in the event of a vacancy in the
                            presidency, the prime minister automatically assumes the office for the
                            duration of the then current five-year term of the National Assembly.
                            Presidential candidates must then be nominated by one or more elected
                            officials, approved by a government commission, and run in a nationwide
                            popular election. The next Assembly election is slated for November
                            1979. The timing of <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s
                            departure from the scene could therefore be an important factor in his
                            immediate successor’s ability to consolidate control over the party and
                            governmental apparatus.</p>
                        <p>7. The 66-year-old <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> has been
                            a trusted adviser of <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            since the struggle for independence and Prime Minister since 1970. He is
                            a conservative on domestic issues and a proponent of Tunisia’s moderate,
                            pro-Western foreign policy. Although widely respected for <pb n="470"
                                facs="0491" xml:id="pg_470"/>his management of the economy,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> lacks a political

                        <p>8. Over the past year a feud between the Tunisian labor movement—headed
                            until recently by <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName>
                            Achour—and the government-party establishment led by <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> has grown into a major political
                                contest.<note n="4" xml:id="d196fn4">The dispute began when party
                                director Mohamed Sayah attempted to undermine Achour’s position.
                                Subsequently, union leaders decided to abandon a labor-government
                                agreement calling for austerity measures, including a wage freeze,
                                during the current five-year plan. [Footnote is in the
                                original.]</note> Achour has attempted to use recurring labor unrest
                            to discredit the <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>

                        <p>9. The labor-government confrontation produced serious splits in the
                            Cabinet in 1977 over whether to negotiate with striking workers or to
                            suppress labor agitation forcibly. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> and other hard-line ministers were allied against
                            Belkhodja and other officials who favored a conciliatory approach.</p>
                        <p>10. Late last December, <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>
                            took his case to the President and threatened to resign if the Interior
                            Minister was not dismissed. Belkhodja and the Surete Chief were promptly
                            relieved of their duties, and within a few days the Foreign Minister and
                            several other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials either resigned in
                            protest or were fired.</p>
                        <p>11. As a result of these personnel changes, <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> now exercises greater control of the government
                            and directs a Cabinet of political conservatives more in keeping with
                            his—and <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s—outlook.
                            Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s
                            reaffirmation of his confidence in the Prime Minister has strengthened
                                <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>’s hand, at least in
                            the short run. The leadership changes also constituted a warning—since
                            fulfilled—to Achour that the government was prepared to deal forcefully
                            with labor unrest.</p>
                        <p>12. The most significant change in the government lineup was the addition
                            of <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Habib Bourguiba, Jr.</persName>, who was
                            given the title of Special Adviser to the President. He is even more
                            hostile than <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> to labor
                            agitation and is likely to counter the influence on the President of
                            Madame Bourguiba, his stepmother, who has been a supporter of Belkhodja,
                            Achour, and former Foreign Minister Masmoudi.</p>
                        <p>13. The younger <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>’s
                            reemergence in politics, after seven years of semiretirement, has led to
                            speculation that he is being groomed to succeed his father. Although the
                            President has repeatedly raised this idea, we doubt that the younger
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> aspires to the post
                            or that he has altered his objection to creating what might look like a
                            hereditary presidency. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not

                            Tunisia</p>
                        <p>74. Tunisia has four good Mediterranean Sea ports—in an area which has
                            relatively few such facilities. The importance of Tunisia’s ports to the
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> 6th Fleet should not be
                            minimized. Tunisia is one of the few Mediterranean countries which
                            permit routine port calls by the 6th Fleet, including its
                            nuclear-powered ships.</p>
                        <p>75. Perhaps more important to <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            strategic interests is the denial of Tunisia’s naval facilities to the
                            Soviet Union. If the Soviets are allowed to undertake frequent and
                            extensive servicing of their submarines or establish a permanent
                            floating base of auxiliary ships in port, <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> strategic interests would be significantly affected.</p>
                        <p>76. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> political interests are served by
                            the generally moderate approach to international problems Tunisia has
                            taken in the various international political forums of which it is a
                            member (the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League, the United
                            Nations, and the nonaligned movement). While Tunisia’s size and wealth
                            preclude leadership roles, it has consistently used its influence to
                            encourage dialogue and compromise in conflict situations. Tunisian
                            moderation has generally been supportive of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss> policy objectives, especially in the Arab-Israeli
                            conflict. In international organizations, Tunisia has typically worked
                            against gratuitous criticism of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and
                            Western policies and has sought to promote cooperative relationships
                            between the Third World and the Western democracies.</p>
                        <p>77. Direct <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> economic and commercial
                            interests in Tunisia are modest (<gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Tunisian trade in 1977 was only about $150 million; <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> private investment in Tunisia is roughly
                            $85 million). The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> economic stake
                            could, however, increase if Tunisia’s petroleum and gas resources prove
                            to be as extensive as recent exploration suggests. Nonetheless,
                            Tunisia’s small population and its lack of significant national wealth
                            preclude its becoming economically significant to the United States.</p>
                        <p>78. Perhaps more important to the United States is Tunisia’s potential
                            role as a model for Third World economic development. Tunisia’s economic
                            performance since 1970, in part the result of foreign and domestic
                            private capital, demonstrates the benefits of a relatively free mixed
                            economy. It is in the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interest to see
                            Tunisia’s experiment in economic development succeed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tunisia’s Perception of the United States</p>
                        <p>79. The overall image of the United States in Tunisia remains positive,
                            and most members of the Tunisian elite believe their country’s close
                            association with the United States since independence has been <pb
                                n="472" facs="0493" xml:id="pg_472"/>beneficial. They are well aware
                            that roughly one-third of Tunisia’s total foreign economic assistance
                            has come from the United States. The United States has also been a major
                            source of military aid, and President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName> has often referred to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> 6th Fleet, whose visits the country
                            accepts virtually on request, as Tunisia’s “shield in the
                            Mediterranean.” Indeed, Tunisian leaders perceive that <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> power has contributed to the country’s
                            security against outside interference. Ideologically and culturally,
                            most of the elite and much of Tunisia’s population prefer the West over
                            the Communist world.</p>
                        <p>80. On the other hand, since the late 1960s the United States has become
                            relatively less important to Tunisia economically, politically, and, to
                            some extent, militarily. <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> influence
                            and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> “privileged” relationship
                            with Tunisia has slowly eroded as <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> aid
                            has declined in importance. Economic aid from the World Bank, France,
                            various Arab states, the Soviet bloc, and China have lessened Tunisia’s
                            dependence on the United States. Politically, close <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> identification with Israel has been a
                            sensitive subject in Tunisia’s domestic politics. It risks becoming more
                            so if Egypt’s peace initiative falters and the Arabs blame the failure
                            on the United States.</p>
                        <p>81. In a strategic sense the Tunisian leadership also may have perceived
                            a shift of international power relationships in the Maghreb and the
                            Mediterranean. The Soviet Union has provided vast amounts of military
                            equipment to both Algeria and Libya. Tunisian leaders continue to be
                            aware of the activity and increased capability of Soviet naval forces in
                            the Mediterranean. The Tunisians reportedly have been disturbed by what
                            they consider signs of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> inability to
                            defend <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> interests in the Third World.
                            Their doubts about <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> resolve stem from
                            their perceptions of the failure of the United States in South Vietnam,
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> decision to opt out of the
                            Angolan civil war in the face of the Soviet-backed Cuban intervention,
                            and the apparent inability of the United States to take action in the
                            Horn of Africa. As a result, it appears that the Tunisian leadership has
                            concluded that it would be prudent to become more visibly nonaligned in
                            the East-West context, while remaining pro-West in outlook and
                            sympathy.</p>

                        <p>The primary purpose of this visit is to underscore the continuing good
                            relations that we enjoy with Tunisia, one of the most moderate, yet
                            socially progressive, of the Arab states. Since Tunisian independence in
                            1956, we have worked closely with President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName>, and even in his recent years of failing
                            health he has remained emotionally pro-American.</p>
                        <p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Tunisia received more aid per capita
                            from the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> than any other developing
                            country. Political stability and generally sound economic and social
                            policies have moved resource-poor Tunisia into the ranks of
                            middle-income countries. As a result, our own aid programs are no longer
                            as essential on economic grounds, but they still symbolize the special
                            relationship that exists between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>In addition to economic assistance, Tunisia has been receiving <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credits, and in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980 they expect at least $25 million as
                            the final installment of a promise we made to help with their military
                            modernization. <gloss target="#t_OMB_1">OMB</gloss> is likely to
                            recommend that this be cut back to $15 million. I do not believe that
                            this is an appropriate time to cut back substantially on the modest
                                <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program for Tunisia,
                            particularly since we may not be able to meet the full $25 million
                            promised for <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1979.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> will be particularly
                            interested in discussing the regional situation in North Africa and the
                            Middle East, as well as economic cooperation. I suggest you make the
                            following points:</p>
                        <p>—We are trying to work closely with our friends in the Middle East and
                            North Africa to enhance the prospects for regional stability and orderly
                            development. To reach this objective, we count heavily on countries such
                            as Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Iran. We
                            also want to open doors to cooperation with other countries in the
                            region—Syria, Algeria, Iraq.</p>
                        <pb n="474" facs="0495" xml:id="pg_474"/>
                        <p>—We remain committed to resisting Soviet intervention, directly or by
                            proxy, in this region. Any Libyan threat to Tunisia would be a matter of
                            grave concern to us and Tunisia could count on our support.</p>
                        <p>—As part of our regional and global strategy, we have been trying to
                            bring about an Arab-Israeli peace settlement. The first step in this
                            process will be peace between Egypt and Israel and the beginning of a
                            transitional process resulting in Palestinian self-government.</p>
                        <p>—Tunisia, and President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>
                            in particular, understands the need to work toward objectives in phases,
                            consolidating at each stage those gains that have been made, while not
                            losing sight of the goal. This is the spirit behind what we are trying

                            Minister. We have had close relations for many years and I want to thank

                                    >Nouira</persName>:</hi> I want to renew my expression of
                            gratitude and thanks for your hospitality. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> hopes to see you someday in
                            Tunisia. He wants to express to you the longstanding friendship between
                            our two countries and the esteem he has for your efforts for peace and
                            your efforts to create a more livable world. The cooperation between our
                            two countries is important both practically and in terms of quality of
                            the relationship. Tunisia is a small country with few resources. We are
                            just emerging from a state of underdevelopment. We are trying to build
                            our idea of development on two humanistic ideas: work and the right of
                            man to enjoy the results of the process <pb n="476" facs="0497"
                                xml:id="pg_476"/>of economic growth. We think we have had good
                            results. We are among the most successful countries in the developing
                            world and our per capita income is increasing. We apply the maxim that
                            if we help ourselves, our friends will then help us. Thirty percent of
                            our <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> is invested, and we use taxes
                            to reallocate our revenues.</p>
                        <p>Tunisia is an old civilization, but we have a young population. Fifty
                            percent of the population is under thirty years of age. This places lots
                            of demands on the government. European influence is strong and people
                            want western standards of living. Two-thirds of our investments are
                            directly productive for the population. The rest goes to infrastructure
                            and so forth. Twenty percent of our total population is in school at one
                            level or another. Eighty percent of our students receive financial
                            support. The result of our previous four-year plan was a six percent
                            rate of growth from 1973 to 1976. We have raised our goal a bit for this
                            current plan, partly because of demographic pressures. Our population is
                            growing at 2.6 percent annually. The number of people living below the
                            poverty level in Tunisia has been reduced from 27 percent to 16 percent
                            in the last ten years. This is defined by a per capita income of $125
                            annually.</p>
                        <p>There are still some regions of Tunisia which are underdeveloped,
                            particularly in the northwest and in the center. We still have
                            immigration from those areas and we need to do more. Nearly one million
                            people live in these five provinces. The United States Government was
                            one of the first to show an interest in helping in those regions, and we
                            hope that this U.S. contribution can be increased. The central area of
                            Tunisia is a weak point in our overall development. It is very important
                            to us. Tunisians want peace and stability so that they can continue with
                            economic and social development. We are very attentive to whatever can
                            be done to make men feel more secure. We are very attached to global and
                            regional efforts to bring peace and to let people work and improve their
                            lives.</p>
                        <p>We only spend seven percent of our budget on external security, but we
                            must be aware of what is happening beyond our borders. There are some
                            who want to destabilize Tunisia, because they see it as an embarrassing
                            example, a model of what can be achieved. We have to look to our right
                            and to our left. There is already a competition for power beginning in
                            Algeria. There are three leading personalities who could end up with
                            responsibilities. We have good relations now, but we must be careful. In
                            the other direction, Libya has ambitions. On September 1, 1978,
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> recognized the
                            failure of previous efforts at unity with Tunisia and spoke of the need
                            for new approaches based on popular revolutionary committees that would
                            be formed in open <pb n="477" facs="0498" xml:id="pg_477"/>or in
                                secret.<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">In telegram 6725 from Tunis,
                                September 21, the Embassy commented on <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                    >Qadhafi</persName>’s speech: “<persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                    >Qadhafi</persName> proclaimed in essence that the January 1974
                                Jerba unification agreement between Tunisia and Libya, ‛temporarily
                                rejected by the forces of regionalism,’ is still valid. He continued
                                that lesson had been learned by this rejection and that as a result,
                                Libya has now been forced to choose another method—that of ’popular
                                revolution.’ He then explained that this involved the creation of
                                ‛peoples revolutionary committees’ which would work—openly or
                                secretly—to seize power and establish unity.” (National Archives, RG
                                59, Central Foreign Policy File, D780389–0947)</note> These would be
                            used to destabilize the “reactionary” Arab states. On October 14th, we
                            discovered a large supply of arms that had come from Libya. There were
                            enough light arms to equip an entire company. We didn’t say much at
                            first and when we did reveal this fact, the Libyans sent their foreign
                            minister to deny it. But we don’t believe them. <persName

                            We hope for success. When we have some troubles internally, we believe
                            they are caused by outside interference, not by internal problems, since
                            we are close to all levels of our society. Tunisia does not have several
                            faces, and we have the courage of sticking with our opinions. We believe
                            that truth pays.</p>

                                    >Carter</persName>:</hi> Let me respond briefly. We have
                            observed with admiration the economic prosperity and growth in Tunisia.
                            This is not just a growth of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>, but
                            also involves a balanced distribution of the better quality of life.
                            This is unprecedented among the nations that I have studied. Your
                            continued commitment to further growth is of great interest to us. Our
                            American business community is increasingly in joint ventures and
                            investment in Tunisia. There are great opportunities for agricultural
                            business to cooperate with Tunisia. I believe that the soundness of your
                            economy will guarantee your future success.</p>
                        <p>The economic prosperity, stability, independence, and security of Tunisia
                            is of great importance to the United States. This is not only important
                            because it benefits your people and the United States, but it helps
                            extend Tunisia’s positive influence throughout North Africa and the
                            Middle East. We have close consultative relationships with Morocco,
                            Tunisia, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. This is a very
                            important stabilizing factor as we face the challenge of increasing
                            Soviet intervention in the area which is so heavily influenced by you.
                            We have been interested in developing a balanced approach in our
                            dealings with the Arab world and Israel. Following Tunisia’s lead, there
                            have been good developments among some Arab countries who no longer see
                            their primary goal as the destruction of Israel. As President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> saw, Israel is here and will
                            survive and we are commit<pb n="478" facs="0499" xml:id="pg_478"/>ted to
                            the Israelis and to their peaceful existence. There is a recognition of
                            this by an increasing number of Arab leaders.</p>
                        <p>We believe that President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                            has taken a courageous and proper step in seeking peace with Israel.
                            This may lead, if it is successful, to a greater harmony between Israel
                            and her neighbors, as well as more cooperation among our Arab friends.
                            This is important at a time of transition or instability in Afghanistan,
                            Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, and even in Iran, as well as the western part
                            of North Africa. We share your concern about the well-being of the
                            Palestinians and your commitment to see the U.N. resolutions, especially
                            U.N. Resolution 242,<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">Adopted unanimously on
                                November 22, 1967. For text of the resolution, see <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Yearbook of the United Nations, 1967</hi>, pp. 257–258.</note>
                            implemented and peace brought to this troubled region. I hope that my
                            assessment of the Camp David agreements is correct. I see them as a
                            major step forward in accomplishing those hopes and aspirations. Doors
                            will be opened for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from much of the
                            occupied territory, and for the establishment of an autonomous
                            self-governing authority and the return of those Palestinians who have
                            been displaced in the 1967 War and thereafter. It will eliminate the
                            Israeli occupation government, and although future negotiations are yet
                            to be conducted, the opportunities are unprecedented and those who
                            object to these efforts can only hurt the prospects for peace and the
                            attainment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, to which we, of
                            course, are committed. It is obvious that in any complicated negotiation
                            there are facets of agreement that are not fully acceptable to the
                            leaders involved. But further violence in the Middle East will open the
                            prospects for regional instability from India as far as the Atlantic
                            Ocean. We see very clearly the possibility for regional conflicts and
                            instability. We hope that we can continue to make progress and to
                            guarantee peace. Instability enhances the influence of the more radical
                            leaders, such as your neighbors, and we think that peace between Egypt
                            and Israel followed by peace between Israel and all of her neighbors and
                            the realization of the rights of the Palestinians and the establishment
                            of autonomy in the occupied territories will be an important step
                            forward. Over lunch it would be helpful to us to have your assessment of
                            the political and military situation in your region, and the possibility
                            of changes in Algeria, if President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> does not survive. We want to see that our
                            attitudes are compatible with your own as we face the future.</p>
                        <p>(From 12:15 to 1:30 p.m. a general discussion took place at lunch.)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Prime Minister</hi> reviewed the situation in
                            Algeria, which he called a very centralized regime where all decisions
                            were made by <pb n="479" facs="0500" xml:id="pg_479"/>President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> who dealt with a
                            group of equally important ministers and advisers. There is no hierarchy
                            around <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, and there is
                            no acknowledged successor. The leading candidates in the Prime
                            Minister’s view are Yahyaoui, the present head of the party and former
                            head of the military academy. Some say that the second contender is
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>, the foreign
                            minister, but the <hi rend="italic">Prime Minister</hi> said that he did
                            not believe that <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> had a
                            chance. The third name that is mentioned and the real second runner is
                            the minister of interior, Abelghani. He has two qualities, the fact that
                            he is a former military officer, and the fact that he succeeded smoothly
                            to the ministry of interior. Another possibility is the former head of
                            military security, who has not always had the confidence of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, Colonel Drai. Finally, some
                            people mentioned the commander of the Oran district, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BC_1">Chadli Bendjedid</persName> who is not well-known.
                            Yahyaoui represents a trend that is seen now in the area, such as in
                            Iran, a certain religious fundamentalism. The most moderate and balanced
                            of the successors would be Abelghani, and the most extreme would be
                            Drai.</p>

                                    Document 163</ref>.</note> and the <hi rend="italic">Prime
                                Minister</hi> replied that the real decision at Baghdad was a
                            decision not to decide. It was an attitude of wait and see. There were
                            many mental reservations. The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> noted
                            that the final communique had looked very negative in its attacks on
                            Egypt. It seemed as if the radical leaders had prevailed. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Prime Minister</hi> said that this was only partly
                            true. The question of any concrete steps against Egypt will be left to
                            another meeting of foreign ministers who would meet once an
                            Egyptian-Israeli agreement was signed.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Minister</hi> noted that there were
                            pressures at Baghdad to take immediate action against Egypt, and that
                            initially Saudi Arabia worked hard to soften this approach. Tunisia
                            played its part, and was helped somewhat by Jordan and Kuwait. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, in the Foreign Minister’s view,
                            did not help his own friends. He refused to receive the delegation that
                            was sent and he insulted many of the Gulf States. This added to the
                            tension at Baghdad. The results that were achieved were the best that
                            were possible under the conditions. They were conditional
                            recommendations.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to Tunisia’s agricultural prospects. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Prime Minister</hi> placed emphasis on the need for
                            quality, since Tunisia could not aspire to a large export of its
                            agricultural products.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">President</hi> mentioned that the U.S.-Tunisian
                            Joint Commission had not been sufficiently active, and perhaps more
                            could be done to <pb n="480" facs="0501" xml:id="pg_480"/>encourage
                            joint ventures. He mentioned that Secretary of Commerce <persName

                            in Tunisia. The <hi rend="italic">Prime Minister</hi> agreed that our
                            commercial relations were not adequately developed.</p>
                        <p>The luncheon ended with the President sending his best regards to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>, and
                            expressing his hope that they would someday meet personally.</p>

                        <p>2. Prior to his departure for Tunisia to participate in the Joint

                            main issues: (a) Tunisian expectations that there will be a substantial
                            increase in U.S. assistance to Tunisia as a result of the highly
                            successful <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> visit and the
                            Joint Commission meeting; (b) the <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss>

                            for Tunisia; and (c) the possible sale of Boeing 747s to Libya as
                            reported in the U.S. press.<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">In a March 3

                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> began by
                            noting that the U.S. has spoken of phasing out aid to Tunisia for a
                            number of years, but for valid reasons we have committed ourselves to
                            assistance through the end of the current five-year plan. Through the
                            Joint Commission meeting and with the participation of Mrs. <persName

                            effective relationship built on trade and investment. Although he did
                            not exclude the possibility of further economic assistance, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> indicated that the U.S. would
                            like to use the Joint Commission meeting as a vehicle to find other ways
                            to cooperate. <persName corresp="#p_BJK_1">Bishop</persName> mentioned

                                Central Foreign Policy File, D780497–0969)</note> He also said that
                            aid levels to Tunisia are ridiculously low when compared to aid figures
                            recently publicized in the press. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> concluded the discussion of aid levels by noting
                            that he had never before this year of extreme budgetary constraint seen
                            senior U.S. Government officials dealing with allocations of such modest
                            amounts of money.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName>’s remarks
                            on <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit to Tunisia, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> indicated that he hoped the 10
                            million dols reinstated by the <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1"
                                >Solarz</persName> subcommittee would be sustained but that, in any
                            case, we would try to provide in future years the total figure mentioned
                            by then Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HPC_1">Habib</persName> in

                        <p>5. Finally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>
                            indicated that the issue of selling 747s to Libya remains under study.
                            We sold the Libyans 727s with the understanding that they would not be
                            used for military purposes. If it were proven that the 727s were now
                            being used in Uganda, it would affect our decision as to whether or not
                            to sell 747s to Libya. In any case, the situation is far from settled.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> asked whether this
                            proposed sale indicated any change in Libyan policy or in U.S. policy
                            toward Libya. He also noted that 747s are too big to be used
                            commercially in North Africa. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName> responded that the situation with Libya is a
                            difficult one for the U.S. Although the Libyans have made several
                            approaches to the U.S. in an effort to improve relations, to the extent
                            Libya supports international terrorism, it will be very difficult to
                            normalize relations. In response to a question from <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HA_1"
                                >Hedda</persName> indicated that Tunisia sees little, if any, change
                            in Libyan policy.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary. The fourth session of the U.S. Tunisian Joint Commission met
                            March 30–31 in Tunis under the chairmanship of Secretary of Commerce
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName> and Minister of
                            Commerce Ben M’Barek. A productive and frank exchange of views reflected
                            increased emphasis on commercial and other non-aid relations and
                            resulted in one major new development—the establishment of a U.S.
                            Tunisian Binational Committee on Communications. The U.S. delegates on
                            the Economic Development Subcommission had a somewhat delicate and
                            difficult task as the Tunisians were intent on our declaring that our
                            concessional assistance would be made available beyond 1981. We noted
                            that 1982 is quite distant and we are not at this time in a position to
                            address the question of aid after 1981. The Trade and Investment
                            Subcommission encountered few differences and shared a desire to move to
                            practical steps to increase two-way trade and the U.S. commercial
                            presence in Tunisia. We are optimistic that the establishment of a
                            Binational Committee on Communications will facilitate cultural and
                            educational exchanges between the two countries. In a period when Middle
                            East developments could have put stress on our bilateral relationships,
                            the Joint Commission meeting definitely served to strengthen these ties.
                            End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. The fourth session of the U.S. Tunisian Joint Commission met in Tunis,
                            March 30–31. The American and Tunisian delegations were headed by

                            contrast to the institutional atmosphere of the “Maison du Parti,” where
                            the last Joint Commission meeting in Tunis took place.<note n="6"

                            fact we said “no” to some requests, the meetings had an upbeat flavor.
                            This was especially true in the Educational and Cultural Cooperation
                            Subcommission. Although funding is (and will be) limited, and important

                        <p>4. The most important issue for the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            in the Economic Development Subcommission clearly was that of extension
                            of bilateral concessional loans and grants after 1981. Following
                            Tunisian Co-Chairman Khelil’s presentation on the importance of
                            continued U.S. economic assistance after 1981, U.S. Co-Chairman Wheeler
                            reaffirmed the U.S.’s intention to provide substantial assistance
                            through the end of the fifth plan. We noted that 1982 is quite distant
                            and indicated the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is not yet in a

                            participation in Tunisia’s economic development, it was made clear to
                            the Tunisians, who fully understood, that the wording does not commit
                            the U.S. to concessional aid after 1981. Rather, as specifically stated
                            in the Economic Development Subcommission, it was understood by both
                            delegations that no decisions have been made regarding the period after
                            1981. It was also understood by both parties that aid decisions
                            applicable to Tunisia are governed in part by our desires to move to
                            less concessional form of assistance in middle-income countries.)</p>
                        <p>5. The second priority for the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>
                            during the Economic Development Subcommission concerned near-term aid
                            levels. This reflected in repeated requests for information about the
                            amounts of funding programmed for projects, in particular for Central
                            Tunisia Rural Development (CTRD); in the tabling of a dossier on an
                            expanded 22-delegation central Tunisia project costing TD100 million,
                            for which an <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> contribution of TD 83
                            million was requested; and in a request for commodity aid of $10 million
                            per year in 1979, 1980, and 1981. In response:</p>
                        <p>A. We stressed that we have taken very seriously our pledge to provide
                            substantial assistance through 1981. Because good projects were
                            available, we last year accorded twice as much aid as we originally
                            estimated.</p>
                        <p>B. We ruled out commodity aid, but did give an indication, subject to the
                            usual caveats of congressional approval and availability of funds, that
                            approximately $25 million might be available for CTRD. In providing this
                            estimate, we stressed the importance of the sub-project planning process
                            through the Central Tunisia Development Authority. Regarding an expanded
                            central Tunisia project, we expressed apprecia<pb n="485" facs="0506"
                                xml:id="pg_485"/>tion for the opportunity to learn the full scope of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> planning for the region, but
                            noted that the program appeared to be more suitable for multi-donor
                            financing.</p>
                        <p>C. With regard to <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> Title I food
                            aid, we indicated it would probably be possible to reach annual levels
                            in 1980 and 1981 on the trend of the last several years, i.e. in the
                            range of $10–12 million, assuming that strong developmental
                            justifications can continue to be made as was done for the FY79 Title I
                            agreement via application of proceeds to CTRD.</p>
                        <p>D. Regarding <gloss target="#t_PL480_1">PL–480</gloss> Title II, we
                            stated that the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> may wish to
                            consider gradual assumption of responsibility for supplemental feeding
                            programs. (In discussions with Khelil following the subcommission
                            sessions, Wheeler put the issue in terms of two options: a gradual
                            unilateral phase-down of Title II shipments by the U.S.; or discussions
                            leading to mutual agreement on a transition schedule permitting orderly
                            budgeting and administrative decision-making on both the U.S. and <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> sides.)</p>
                        <p>E. In respect to the housing guaranty program reference was made to
                            on-going negotiations for a $25 million investment program to be
                            authorized in FY79, to be followed by second tranche of $25 million in
                            1981. Both sides expressed satisfaction with negotiation and confidence
                            these would soon be satisfactorily concluded.</p>
                        <p>6. The Subcommission on Trade and Investment reviewed a number of issues
                            of mutual interest. There was ample give and take, and common ground was
                            reached on most topics.</p>
                        <p>7. The following are highlights of the discussions:</p>
                        <p>A. The Tunisians noted their imports of $2 billion. They felt Tunisia
                            should be an interesting market for U.S. manufacturers, as 70 percent of
                            imports are capital goods, and expressed disappointment at the limited
                            response of U.S. firms to calls for tender.</p>
                        <p>B. In response to a <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> request, we
                            explained that their thorough understanding of <gloss target="#t_GSP_1"
                                >GSP</gloss> could result in more favorable treatment for Tunisian
                            exports in the U.S. The Tunisians seemed eager to pursue <gloss
                                target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss>, in particular to start using the
                            petition system. We expect further <gloss target="#t_GSP_1">GSP</gloss>
                            discussion both in Washington and Tunis.</p>
                        <p>C. CEPEX (Tunisian export promotion agency) would like to be able to call
                            on U.S. Department of Commerce resources for assistance in gathering
                            American market information, and in organizing two Tunisian
                            buying/selling missions to the U.S. It was agreed that the U.S.
                            Department of Commerce (through CAGNE) would provide such
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>D. API (Tunisian investment promotion agency) requested that <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> locate and financially support
                            American investment advisors for <pb n="486" facs="0507" xml:id="pg_486"
                            />its New York and Tunis offices. We explained <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1"
                                >OPIC</gloss> could not meet this request given its limited
                            resources. However, the <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>
                            representative reiterated that it continues to be upbeat on Tunisia. By
                            coming up with good specific projects for <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1"
                                >OPIC</gloss> to market in the U.S., Tunisia could preempt more
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> resources. Further, <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> is willing to consider devoting more
                            of its time to the Tunisian program.</p>
                        <p>E. The Tunisians requested <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> provide
                            funds for an agribusiness expediting office in Tunis. We explained that
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> had invested over $1.5
                            million in support of agribusiness council activities in developing
                            countries, and only one project had ever been realized, and, therefore,
                            funding for such an office would not be possible. We made the point that
                                <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> remained available to assist
                            American investors with insurance, loans and feasibility study funding
                            for their Tunisian investments.</p>
                        <p>F. We explained USAID’s reimbursable development program, and how this
                            program—with funding for prospection and orientation visits and
                            feasibility studies—increases the possibilities for access to U.S.
                            technology, especially in the American private sector. The Tunisians
                            seemed quite interested; this promises to be an excellent tool for
                            bolstering our export development program in conjunction with USDOC and
                            EXIMBank.</p>
                        <p>G. Other topics were discussed, i.e., discrepancies in reporting trade
                            statistics, problems encountered in identifying and formulating private
                            investment projects, and agreement in principle was reached to resume
                            negotiations for a U.S. Tunisian tax treaty. This last topic needs to be
                            pursued; we will follow up in the coming week.</p>
                        <p>8. The work of the Educational and Cultural Cooperation (third)
                            Subcommission proceeded smoothly without any major disagreements between
                            the two parties. The relative ease with which agreements were made can
                            be attributed to discussions with the Tunisian side before the formal
                            opening of the commission. Indeed, discussion of a draft accord and
                            memorandum had already taken place. Meetings of the subcommission
                            therefore were devoted to listening to the Tunisian requests for aid in
                            the areas of education, cultural, information, youth and sports and then
                            to agreeing on final drafting of official documents. The subcommission
                            decided to establish a Tunisian-U.S. Binational Committee on
                            Communications to discuss and implement joint programs on a case by case
                            basis. This committee will meet quarterly in Tunis.</p>
                        <p>9. Only two major points requiring negotiation arose in discussions of
                            this subcommission. The Tunisians objected to use of term “cost sharing”
                            in relation to financing exchange programs. They felt it implied an
                            equal division of costs in all cases. Instead, language calling for the
                            apportioning of costs was settled upon. On another issue, we had wished
                            to get the Tunisians to agree to facilitating the work of <pb n="487"
                                facs="0508" xml:id="pg_487"/>American archaeologists, including all
                            phases of field work and digs. The Tunisians refused to accept the
                            mention of field work and excavations in any official document. They
                            simply promised to facilitate cooperation between archaeological
                            institutes, thus revealing extreme sensitivity to safeguard what is for
                            them an important element of their national heritage.</p>
                        <p>10. On the whole, we found in the third subcommission that the Tunisians,
                            while intent upon presenting their “shopping list”, were content to
                            settle for the establishment of a Binational Communications Committee in
                            the hope they could achieve their ends through regular and less formal
                            negotiations with <gloss target="#t_ICA_1">ICA</gloss> Tunis.</p>
                        <p>11. In sum, the Joint Commission meeting went well. The presence of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName> and <gloss
                                target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss> President Llewellyn clearly signaled
                            our interest in Tunisia. Although the Tunisians were slow getting
                            started, the entire proceedings went smoothly, and the hospitality
                            offered Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KJM_1">Kreps</persName> was
                            equal to any afforded a visiting Minister. There were no dramatic new
                            departures, but the meeting—at a time when other developments in the
                            Middle East might have placed stress on our bilateral
                            relations—contributed to the maintenance of our excellent relations and
                            gave reasonable promise of strengthening developmental, cultural and
                            commercial ties.</p>

                            there were very encouraging discussions about the contributions which
                            the American private and public sectors can make to this process. I

                            with your government in the very near future. Discussions already have
                            begun with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hedda</persName> on
                            the achievement of the objectives of the new Subcommission on Education

                            into the Middle East peace process. I can assure you that the United
                            States Government regards their participation as essential to the
                            achievement of a just and viable peace. They are, as you know, invited
                            to attend the negotiations that are to open within one month as members
                            of the Egyptian or Jordanian delegations.<note n="5" xml:id="d202fn5">In

                                    >Bosworth</persName> reported <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                    >Nouira</persName>’s gratitude for the letter and his skepticism
                                about the planned negotiations: “He said he noted that U.S. position
                                continued to be that Palestinian participation in the second round
                                of negotiations could be accomplished through inclusion of
                                Palestinians in the Egyptian and or Jordanian delegations. He said
                                this seemed most unlikely. There is no way that <persName

                                Palestinians and it is unlikely that Jordan will agree to
                                participate in the negotiations, much less agree to the CDA formula
                                on Palestinian participation. In the meantime, events within the
                                Arab world are going from bad to worse. The Prime Minister said he
                                is increasingly convinced that some new move is required on the
                                Palestinian issue and that this can only come from the U.S.”

                            in the negotiations, because it will be through such engagement that
                            they can best influence the outcome of the negotiations. We hope
                            Palestinian leaders will realize that these negotiations offer the first

                        <p>These negotiations will be difficult, but President <persName

                            everything possible to help the parties achieve a successful outcome.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName>, you, and
                            Tunisia’s other early leaders have experienced personally the
                            frustrations but also the ultimate success of protracted negotiations. I

                            reluctant to participate in the present process to overcome their
                            understandable hesitation and join the effort to achieve a settlement

                            those resisting any attempt to expel Egypt from the Islamic Conference.
                            I think you will agree that the survival of moderate government in Egypt
                            is important to peace in North Africa. The current campaign to punish

                            sought Arab League headquarters and assured Under Secretary that <gloss

                                >USG</gloss> approach to Arab-Israeli dispute and hope that moderate

                            general discussions with Italian Government and Vatican. He was happy
                            also to visit Tunis, this being first such opportunity since 1976. Under
                            Secretary said U.S. was conscious of Tunisia’s more central position now
                            in Arab world and confident that U.S.-Tunisian relations would remain
                            close.</p>
                        <p>4. Prime Minister responded that Tunisia finds it difficult to
                            communicate with Libya even on bilateral matters. He supposed Libyans
                            would have suggested to Under Secretary that if <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> will not sell Boeing 747’s to Libya, Libya might
                            withhold petroleum sales to United States. He expressed skepticism Libya
                            in fact would take such action. He noted that in context of erratic
                            Libyan policy one could observe two constants. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> had not as yet interfered with
                            petroleum or banks. Apparently he realized these two sectors were
                            essential to his purposes. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>
                            suggested Libya had no legitimate need for 747 aircraft for commercial
                            service. Given importance of U.S. oil market to Libya, he doubted
                                <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would embargo exports
                            to the United States.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> added that for first
                            time one could note organized opposition to <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName>, centered in a European country abroad.
                            Opposition was beginning to act; <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> faced trouble ahead.</p>
                        <p>6. In respect to Tunisia’s role in Arab League, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> said, Under Secretary should be
                            reassured that relations with United States remained constant; they
                            would not be affected by Tunisia’s host of Arab League. In fact, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> had not sought this role. It had only

                            by other Arab states to accept it. Baghdad decision to exclude Egypt
                            from all Arab organizations was being implemented, but not precisely as
                            reported in Egyptian press. There were distortions in reporting, for
                            instance in respect to recent <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            agricultural meeting in Tunisia. In any event, <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> should rest assured that Tunisia was and would remain
                            the same both geographically and politically.</p>
                        <p>7. Under Secretary reviewed his conversations in Libya with Foreign
                            Minister Turayki and Major Jallud. Perhaps because he did not carry a
                            more specific response on the 747 question, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                                >Qadhafi</persName> remained unavailable. He was said to be in
                            Sirte. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said primary
                            Libyan desire appeared to be to discuss aircraft export ban. He
                            explained that ban resulted from Libyan use of commercial aircraft in
                            support of military operations in Uganda. Libyans made clear their own
                            perception that U.S. action was “punishment”. They in turn were
                            considering reprisals, possibly affecting petroleum exports to the
                            USA.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> explained to Libyans
                            that their support for Amin and for militant groups from Northern
                            Ireland to South Africa led the U.S. Government, backed by the Congress,
                            to believe U.S. should take no action—such as aircraft exports—that
                            would enhance Libyan ability to intervene abroad. Jallud indicated
                            support for “liberation movements” abroad remained integral part of
                            Libya’s foreign policy. Under Secretary gave Libyans no hope for a
                            change in U.S. decision on aircraft export. Nevertheless, Libyans
                            indicated they still attribute importance to relations with the U.S. It
                            was not yet clear whether they would take reprisal action and, if so,
                            what type of action.</p>
                        <p>9. Libyans also raised question of U.S. military sales to Egypt; Under
                            Secretary explained these were not unusual or alarming under present
                            circumstances. He made clear to Libyans that <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> would favor neither Egyptian military action against
                            Libya nor Libyan action against Egypt.</p>
                        <p>10. Re peace process, Under Secretary said he found GOL attitude
                            uncompromising. Jallud voiced Libyan attitude toward <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, emphasizing <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                                >PLO</gloss> must include all factions and indicating Libyan support
                            of Arafat as mainstream Palestinian voice was assured only as long as he
                            remained representative of various Palestinian factions and “true
                            interests of the Palestinian people.” Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> commented that Arafat and Libya
                            were not closely aligned and that Arafat—certainly not the only
                            possibility for Palestinian leadership—represents moderate sentiment
                            compared with other factional leaders such as Jelil and Hawatma (Sahbani
                            also mentioned Habash).</p>
                        <p>11. Prime Minister felt <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>, in
                            deploying diplomatic resources, should devote more attention to working
                            with the Arab moderates—the agnostics on peace process that was
                            promisingly launched at Camp <pb n="492" facs="0513" xml:id="pg_492"
                            />David. He said <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> had the benefit of
                            the personal interpretations of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                >Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>,
                            for instance in respect to Palestinian autonomy question. These,
                            however, appeared to be at complete variance with that of Prime Minster
                            Begin, which, he said, was completely out of line with international
                            law. Begin apparently wished to exploit fact that U.S. was moving into
                            election year.</p>
                        <p>12. Under Secretary responded that it was a tragedy that Arab opposition
                            inhibited Palestinian participation in negotiations. This may well lead
                            Israelis to believe that, since Egypt stood alone, they need make no
                            concessions. He suggested Palestinians and moderate Arabs could change
                            face of peace process by showing willingness to participate in
                            negotiations. Whether or not it was politically realistic, it was a
                            fact. Prime Minister acknowledged Under Secretary’s logic, though it was
                            only an assumption.</p>
                        <p>13. Under Secretary spoke of negotiations getting under way in Alexandria
                            and Haifa which, so far, had been caught up mainly in procedural
                            questions. One of these, however, was not unimportant. Israelis were
                            asking for better definition of U.S. role as “full partner” in the
                            talks. It seemed Israelis wished to diminish U.S. role, while Egyptians
                            and U.S. thought it important that we remain a principal player. Under
                            Secretary commented it was hard to credit the charge of some Arab states
                            that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is allied with Israel when in
                            fact latter resists U.S. role in negotiations.</p>
                        <p>14. Under Secretary proceeded to outline issues <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> realizes are essential to make formula on Palestinian
                            autonomy acceptable to Arabs. These include settlements, land and water
                            rights, Palestinian participation, and ultimately, Jerusalem. He
                            acknowledged <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> had heavy
                            responsibility in negotiations and wants Arab world to know we accept
                            this responsibility.</p>
                        <p>15. We know attitudes of Arab governments and difficulty of their giving
                            open support for our efforts. However, we do want these governments (a)
                            to understand what we are trying to do, (b) to have confidence in the
                            genuineness of our efforts, and (c) to recognize our real interest in
                            the rights of Palestinian people. We want them to be ready and able to
                            join with us in peace process when we show we can produce results.</p>
                        <p>16. We also hope to minimize intra-Arab tensions. We hope Arab-Egyptian
                            relations will not be made intolerable, that Egyptian-Saudi relations
                            will be stabilized. We hope intra-Arab relations will not so deteriorate
                            as to bar acceptance of negotiations when they show results. We will
                            make every effort to keep Tunisian Government informed and, as always,
                            will value Tunisia’s advice and counsel. We know Tunisia has long been
                            important as a bridge between factions in Arab world, as well as a means
                            of interface and articulation of Arab views to other peoples. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> expressed appreciation of Under
                            Secretary’s exposition and his concern with Tunisian views.</p>
                        <pb n="493" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_493"/>
                        <p>17. Under Secretary asked if Prime Minister saw a nuance in Syrian
                            position—especially that of President Assad—which would distinguish it
                            from those of Iraq and Libya. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> agreed such a nuance existed even though
                            President Assad had little room to maneuver. Re question of U.S.
                            relations with <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDD_1">Newsom</persName> said U.S. aware from indirect
                            contacts of position of <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. U.S.
                            continued to require that <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> accept

                            condition for direct talks. Recent <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>
                            positions have been equivocal. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1"
                                >Nouira</persName> said that despite his close <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> contacts he could not define <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> position. Much of problem seemed to
                            center on <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> acceptance of Resolution
                            242. He thought an answer might lie with recognition of Israel with its
                            implied, modified or amended language going beyond 242’s reference to
                            Palestinians as mere refugees to recognition of their rights as people.
                            Prime Minister suggested <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> might meet
                            political requirements of <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> by
                            combining essence of Resolution 242 with elements of declarations made
                            jointly with Tunisian, Japanese and Soviet Governments. These
                            declarations, he said, had been tacitly accepted—or better—by <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss> leaders.</p>
                        <p>18. Under Secretary expressed interest in views and ideas articulated by
                            Prime Minister and said he would transmit these to Secy of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. Close contact would
                            be maintained with Tunisian Government through the American Ambassador
                            in Tunis. Prime Minister agreed on value of continuing contact and asked
                            Under Secretary to convey his best regards to President <persName

                        <p>3. It is still difficult to assess the real nature and magnitude of the
                            immediate security threat faced by Tunisia. However, we can draw certain
                            preliminary conclusions based on the briefings given me by Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> and Defense
                            Minister Sfar, the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s public

                        <p>4. It is evident that the attack on military and police installations in
                            Gafsa was carried out by a trained, relatively well-armed force. There
                            was little, if any, active support for the attackers from the Gafsa
                            populace. Reports in numbers of the attacking group range from 30 to
                            300. But whatever the number they were able to inflict considerable
                            damage and, despite <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> statements to
                            the contrary, may still not have been completely suppressed.</p>
                        <p>5. While most, or even all, of the attackers were Tunisian, the attack
                            was in all likelihood organized and supported from outside Tunisia,
                            probably from Libya. The group apparently did come in from Algeria, but
                            the role, if any, of Algerian authorities is unclear.</p>
                        <p>6. There have been some mild labor disturbances over recent price
                            increases elsewhere (bus drivers in Tunis, rail workers in Sfax, etc.).
                            But there is currently no evidence these are likely to become serious or
                            that they are directly linked to events in Gafsa.</p>
                        <pb n="495" facs="0516" xml:id="pg_495"/>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> and Defense Minister
                            Sfar claim to have convincing evidence that the attack in Gafsa is not
                            an isolated, one-time event. In my judgement, they may be reading
                            whatever intelligence they have in the most alarming possible light, but
                            they are not simply crying wolf. They are sincerely worried. We have
                            first-hand reports of substantial troop movements from the north to the
                            south and we expect similar movements are taking place into northwest
                            Tunisia as well.</p>
                        <p>[8.] In fact, we judge it unlikely—although perhaps not
                            inconceivable—that Libya, with or without any Algerian acquiescense is
                            preparing to launch a full-scale invasion. However, if Col. <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> has decided he wants seriously
                            to destabilize Tunisia, he can probably achieve that result through a
                            series of Gafsa-type attacks, carried out with more of the Tunisians he
                            is believed to have recruited and trained from among the 80,000
                            Tunisians working in Libya. Tunisia, with its long frontiers, is
                            vulnerable to such attacks. The <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss>’s
                            self-confidence would begin to falter and eventually we might well see a
                            breakdown of public order and even military defections.</p>
                        <p>[9.] This is the situation within which we must structure a response to
                            the urgent <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> request for assistance
                            in the form of helicopters and <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>’s.
                            The request seems appropriate in military terms. Our judgement is that
                            the lack of adequate surveillance and transport capabilities is one of
                            the Tunisian military’s most glaring weaknesses in trying to cope with
                            events such as that in Gafsa.</p>
                        <p>[10.] More importantly, a <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> failure to
                            respond effectively and credibly to the Tunisian request will almost
                            certainly have a profound impact on our overall bilateral relationship
                            and quite possibly on Tunisia’s basic international orientation. Even if
                            the Tunisian assessment of the current situation proves to have been
                            exaggerated, a demonstrated <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                            reluctance or inability to provide assistance when Tunisia perceives an
                            acute, immediate threat to its national security cannot help but
                            influence future <gloss target="#t_GOT_1">GOT</gloss> decisions on
                            matters of fundamental importance to the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>[11.] At the same time, however, I recognize that the Tunisian request
                            for equipment, modest as it might seem to them, will be difficult to
                            satisfy, particularly within the time period they expect. (I assume that
                            any such equipment would probably have to be drawn from <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD_1">DOD</gloss> inventories.) Also, it would be useful
                            to gain a bit more time to obtain a more complete assessment of the
                            events in Gafsa and the short-term threat of further such incidents.
                            Moreover, we would need in any event much more detailed information
                            concerning the specifics of the desired equipment, etc., before we could
                            respond.</p>
                        <p>[12.] Therefore, I recommend that I be authorized to respond to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName>’s request on an interim basis by
                            saying that (a) we are seriously concerned by the apparent threat to
                            Tunisian security and are actively <pb n="496" facs="0517"
                                xml:id="pg_496"/>considering the <gloss target="#t_GOT_1"
                                >GOT</gloss>’s request for emergency assistance and (b) that we
                            would propose to bring in quietly, but quickly a small team of experts
                            to review Tunisia’s immediate needs in the areas they have highlighted
                            and determine how we can be most helpful.</p>
                        <p>[13.] We may find that with the additional time this procedure would
                            give, the currently acute Tunisian concern will moderate to the point at
                            which we can credibly respond to their request on a less urgent basis
                            by, for example, restructuring and perhaps accelerating pending <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> credit purchases (e.g. early delivery
                            of <gloss target="#t_APC_1">APC</gloss>’s (is) now scheduled for 1981,
                            etc.) However, realistically we will also have to be prepared to follow
                            through with at least some equipment on the emergency basis which
                            underlies the procedure we have proposed.</p>

                            play, of our stepped-up assistance to Tunisia and to prolong the initial
                            satisfaction of the Tunisians themselves, someone from the White House,
                            ideally you, should soon visit Tunis as a visible sign of the
                            President’s interest in that country. (C)</p>
                        <p>In my view, a mid-March visit by a ranking White House emissary would do
                            the following useful things:</p>
                        <p>—demonstrate the President’s personal support for Tunisia and our
                            gratitude for the gutsy positions it has adopted on issues of major
                            importance to us; (C)</p>
                        <p>—build additional credit in a Moslem country (which also happens to be
                            the headquarters of the Arab League) at a time when we have an enormous
                            stake in the fate of contemporary Islam; (C)</p>
                        <p>—convey a pointed signal to neighboring countries (read Libya) that we
                            care what happens in and to Tunisia. (C)</p>
                        <p>(If I weren’t stopped from doing so by the Hatch Act,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d207fn2">The 1939 Hatch Act prohibits Executive Branch

                            policy reasons which would make such a visit worthwhile as well.)
                            (U)</p>
                        <p>Two C–5As and a C–141 will be delivering the modest number of APCs we
                            promised by the end of this week. Because of 36(b), however, the UH–1N
                            choppers (assuming Congress approves them) will be much longer in
                            transit, at least two months. Tunisia already feels, with some
                            justification, that we have taken it too much for granted and that it
                            has assumed sizeable risks in its pro-West positions without much
                            benefit of the compensating closeness we reserve for some other
                            countries. In that connection, I note that the only ranking <gloss

                        <p>We are dealing here with a very sensitive bunch (like most North
                            Africans) where a bit of personal massaging and symbolism can go a long
                            way. This will be particularly useful if we are to avoid disgruntlement
                            flowing from the protracted delivery time for the choppers and the less
                            than wildly generous terms through which the Tunisians are obliged to
                            fund them. The torching of the French Embassy in Tripoli provides enough
                            drama for the moment (and may even, via Gallic outrage, produce
                            additional anti-Libyan measures likely to please Tunisia); but come
                            mid-March, when our own helicopters have not yet arrived, chances are
                            good that without some personalized attention from us Tunisia will be
                            pissed. (C)</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Each time that world peace is threatened or that the principles governing
                            the relations between states are disregarded, our regular contacts at
                            the highest level have brought us to consult one another, and to note
                            with satisfaction an agreement of views with regard to the great
                            problems of our time. This identify of view is the result of our common
                            dedication to the moral and political values which, in the last resort,
                            have proven to be the basis of the free world.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the last several months, the world has been subjected to
                            frequent and flagrant violations of the United Nations Charter. Asia and
                            Africa, in particular, have been shaken on various occasions by violent
                            actions which betray a more or less open will towards hegemony, if not
                            domination. It is in Africa, where the challenges of underdevelopment
                            and misery are most extreme, that the will to destabilize is brought to
                            bear most sharply, without the community of nations having taken
                            decisions commensurate with the danger. Our own area in North Africa has
                            become the most immediate target, this threat deriving from the
                            unchecked activism of the Libyan regime.</p>
                        <p>Today, Mr President, Tunisia in its turn is the object of an attempt at
                            destabilization. You will understand if, at this particularly grave
                            moment, I share my concerns with you. I am pleased on this occasion to
                            express Tunisia’s profound gratitude for the spontaneous and unreserved
                            support which, in these difficult moments, we have received from you,
                            the American people and its leaders.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to the diligence and understanding of your administration we
                            received expeditious delivery of a first shipment of defensive military
                            equipment. At the same time, American political figures have proclaimed
                            their support for Tunisia and their attachment to its independence.</p>
                        <p>This attitude has been a great comfort to me and to my colleagues. It is
                            interpreted in Tunisia as a true indication of the esteem and active
                            solidarity which are the basis of the constancy and stability of
                            relations between our two countries.</p>

                        <p>The aggression of January 27, 1980 against the town of Gafsa was
                            conceived, elaborated and directed by the Libyan regime.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d209fn4">See <ref target="#d204">Document 204</ref>.</note>
                            Our investigation has given ample proof of this. At the same time, the
                            results of the investigation and the statements made by the principal
                            (Libyan) leaders confirm, moreover, that Tripoli—this hardly being its
                            first intervention—no longer conceals its determination to bring down
                            our regime by any means available. No doubt the existence on its border
                            of a country which is profoundly peaceful, very lightly armed,
                            fundamentally dedicated to the cultural, social and economic progress of
                            its citizenry, and basing itself on a political and developmental model
                            aiming at human development, is considered a warlike act. In fact,
                            Tunisia is an embarrassing example—given the bad conscience of those
                            who, possessing considerable natural resources, have constantly given
                            priority to ideological and political considerations over the demands of
                            development. These represent two irreconcilable points of view, given
                            the primary interest of states in development.</p>
                        <p>But the Gafsa aggression has a considerably broader significance. Through
                            the destabilization of Tunisia, wedged in between two regimes with
                            different ideologies, the balance of the entire region is placed in
                            jeopardy. In creating a new area of tension, Libya is facilitating the
                            introduction of Soviet influence on the southern shore of the
                            Mediterranean—with unavoidable consequences for the future peace and
                            security of the entire Mediterranean and, consequently, of the Western
                            world.</p>
                        <p>Given the perils which lie in wait for it, and facing the challenges
                            which confront it, Tunisia intends to remain faithful to the image which
                            it has won through 25 years of political and constitutional stability,
                            and by a sustained effort—through flexible planning—dedicated above all
                            to human development. Swept today in a wake which it had never judged so
                            urgent, Tunisia must meet the strong and equally urgent demands of
                            simultaneously reestablishing internal political confidence and of
                            developing a security force capable of deaing with the unforeseeable.
                            Thus, Tunisia turns to the most powerful of its friends, the United
                            States of America. In the immediate future and for the next several
                            months it will be a question of lessening the vulnerability of our
                            country through continuous strategic and military support in order to
                            forestall any initiatives aimed at its integrity and sovereignty. At the
                            same time, it is a question of enlisting your indispensable cooperation
                            with regard to special financing in order quickly to redress the balance
                            of arms necessary to the defense of our frontiers.</p>

                            limited budget constraints we face. We would hope to be able to provide
                            the necessary assistance. The recent delivery was about the fastest we
                            have ever made.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BH_2"
                                >Bourguiba</persName></hi> said that the attack was a clear attempt
                            to destabilize Tunisia but it had not succeeded. The population remained
                            faithful to the regime and Tunisia’s friends came to its rescue, the
                            foremost of whom was the United States. Tunisia will never forget that.
                            However, on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_QM_1"
                            >Qadhafi</persName>’s own threats, the attempt will occur again. Now
                            that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NH_1">Nouira</persName> is
                            ill, <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> expects that his
                            opponents will combine to form a government more to his liking. In 1956
                            Tunisia made a choice in favor of people above materialism. In 1980,
                            that same choice has resulted in a nation which disturbs those
                            neighboring countries who made other choices. The regime is still
                            fragile, although it has advanced more in human terms than the others
                            have been able to do with all their oil and gas. Tunisia must be able to
                            defend itself, so it must divert the little nature has provided away
                            from development. Tunisia must have the capability at least to detect
                            and deter future actions of the sort which happened recently. He did not
                            anticipate direct military action but future attempts of the same type
                            of guerrilla operation. Tunisia’s friends and those who share its values
                            must share this concern. The decision the U.S. takes will have a great
                            psychological effect. It will persuade those who are timid to speak up
                            in Tunisia’s behalf and will encourage Tunisia to keep on with its
                            efforts. It will help Tunisia to keep high its honor and be a little
                            showing of the Free World and idealistic world in the world of
                            materialism. He was aware that the U.S. has financial and other
                            problems, but he wanted to stress that Tunisia is one of the links of
                            the Free World.</p>

                            begun to speak a little badly of Tunisia.</p>

                            feelings about <persName corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> would
                            overcome whatever other concerns he might have. The movement of the Arab

                            independence of Tunisia. He felt that the U.S., France and other friends
                            could help Tunisia overcome the propaganda attacks being directed

                                >Waldheim</persName> said he wanted to bring the Secretary up to
                            date on the following recent developments with respect to the Sahara and
                            to seek his assistance.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> said that when he was
                            recently in Saudi Arabia, he had met with Algerian Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName>, who had asked for
                            his help in finding a face-saving formula<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">An
                                unknown hand underlined “face-saving formula.”</note> for Algiers.
                            Subsequently, when he was in Maputo, he had been approached by an
                            emissary of <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s
                            (phonetic spelling Sahnoun) with a further request for his
                            assistance.</p>
                        <p>3. One idea that had occurred to him, <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> said, was the autonomy for the Sahara. With
                            both the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> divided on this subject, however, King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> felt in a strong
                            position and <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> doubted
                            that he was ready for a face-saving solution. He was nevertheless in
                            touch with a Moroccan representative in Geneva to explore whether any
                            new approach to this problem was possible. The Algerians hoped for a
                            solution before the African summit in Gabon in July and were urging him
                            to visit the area. <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> said
                            he wanted first, however, to see whether Morocco was ready for any kind
                            of face-saving procedure such as, for example, a process of
                            consultations with Saharoui leaders. He had also discussed this problem
                            with Sadruddin Aga Khan, who is carrying out census of Saharouis in
                            Algeria.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s emissary had told him the
                            Moroccans were massing troops on the Algerian border. According to
                            Sadruddin Khan, there was no doubt the Algerians are supporting the <pb

                            <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> said we could tell
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> of the approach to
                            him by <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s emissary in
                            Maputo, who had said that Algeria is worried about the situation and has
                            asked the Secretary General to take an initiative which could contribute
                            to a solution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> said he was cautious
                            about again involving himself in the Saharan situation after his last
                            experience. King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> takes
                            the position that the problem has been solved and that the
                            self-determination requirement was fulfilled through his consultation
                            with the Saharoui Assembly. Neither Spain nor Algeria accepts this,
                            however, pointing out that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> only consulted a rump assembly consisting of
                            Moroccan stooges. They did not agree that this fulfilled Morocco’s
                            obligation under the Moroccan-Mauritanian-Spanish agreement.<note n="5"

                                consult with the GOS at an early stage, if only on a closely held
                                basis. Such consultation is not only entirely consistent with our
                                treaty relationship, but in addition, Spain’s long-time experience
                                in the area suggests the GOS might have some helpful insights.”

                        <p>1. As you have seen from reftels, our Embassies in the area recommend
                            strongly against our getting involved in any <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> initiative on Sahara problem and question
                            whether there is anything constructive <pb n="510" facs="0531"
                                xml:id="pg_510"/>SYG could do at this point. We share negative
                            assessment of prospects for <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> initiative, and understand dangers of U.S.
                            involvement in enterprise which could needlessly complicate our
                            relations with <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> and do
                            little to ingratiate us with the Algerians or resolve the basic
                            conflict. We also wish to avoid introducing an element of superpower
                            involvement into a situation which we have told both sides we believe
                            should be settled on a regional basis. Nonetheless, we see no harm in
                            simply informing Moroccans of Algerian approach to <persName
                                corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> while stressing our own “hands
                            off” policy.</p>
                        <p>2. Among other factors which incline us towards a not overly encouraging
                            response to <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> are:
                                <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName>’s fear that the
                            Moroccans may be planning a preemptive strike or that the French may
                            intervene on the side of the Mauritanians is not supported by
                            intelligence reports or on-the-scene observers.</p>
                        <p>—A French report indicates that the Moroccans and Algerians already have
                            turned down <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName>’s proposal
                            for “some kind of autonomy” for the Saharans as an element of a possible
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>—The French are concerned that a <persName corresp="#p_WK_1"
                                >Waldheim</persName> initiative might complicate their efforts to
                            free their hostages captured by the Polisario at Zouerate.</p>
                        <p>3. Looking to the future, we recognize that the Western Sahara issue
                            requires our continued attention because it is potentially destabilizing
                            and shows no signs of going away. There are indications that the
                            Polisario has strengthened its infrastructure and its operational
                            capacity despite significant military commitments by Morocco and
                            Mauritania. It seems unlikely that the guerrillas will be able to win a
                            military victory and a clash between Morocco and Algeria also appears
                            remote, but the strains of maintaining their levels of activity in the
                            Sahara put pressures on all three governments involved. In addition, we
                            are concerned about the human rights problems associated with the
                            thousands of Saharans living in refugee camps in Algeria. With this in
                            mind, we are considering a possible response to the UNHCR’s renewed
                            appeal for contributions for Saharan refugees.</p>

                                corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName>’s own ambivalence and the
                            exploratory nature of his exchange with Secretary on this matter, we
                            believe that an informal, oral reply would be appropriate. Please seek
                            meeting with SYG to deliver message, on behalf of the Secretary, drawing
                            on the following talking points:</p>
                        <p>—During your recent meeting with the Secretary in Geneva there was a
                            discussion of possible initiatives to resolve the Sahara dispute.</p>
                        <p>—We have given careful thought to Algeria’s proposal and to your own
                            ideas as to possible face-saving formulas. We have also solicited the
                            views of our Embassies in the area.</p>
                        <pb n="511" facs="0532" xml:id="pg_511"/>
                        <p>—Our judgment is that the Moroccan Government would not be receptive at
                            this time to an outside initiative, whatever its origin.</p>
                        <p>—In addition, we have consistently maintained the position that this
                            problem can best be resolved on a regional basis, and that it should not
                            become a source of contention among the major powers.</p>
                        <p>—As you requested, we plan to inform King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> through Foreign Minister <persName

                            Maputo.</p>
                        <p>—For the reasons cited above, however, we are disinclined at the moment
                            to become further involved in discussions of possible face-saving
                            solutions.</p>
                        <p>—Should it appear in the future that either side were contemplating
                            action against the other, we would be prepared to reconsider our own
                            diplomatic role.</p>
                        <p>5. For Rabat: Per <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName> request

                            solution, but reassure him that U.S. is maintaining its “hands-off”
                            position and does not wish to become involved in these endeavors.<note

                        <p>The conflict between Morocco and Algeria over the Western Sahara is not a
                            high-priority foreign policy concern at present, but we have no interest
                            in seeing the tension continue. Morocco is clearly unhappy with the
                            drain on its resources required by the fight against evasive Polisario
                            guerrillas, and Algeria has hinted that it wants a face-saving
                            settlement. It is not inconceivable that both parties may turn to us to
                            provide good offices.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background to the Dispute</p>
                        <p>You are no doubt aware that Morocco maintained historic claims to all of
                            Mauritania up until 1970, and to parts of Algeria until 1972. (These
                            latter are still unsettled.) As Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LA_1">Laraki</persName> noted to you, Morocco does not
                            subscribe to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> principle of
                            inviolability of the frontiers inherited from the colonial period.<note

                        <p>The Moroccan claim to the Western Sahara is not overwhelmingly
                            impressive, but the alternative of permitting a small nomadic population
                            of some 70–80,000 to exercise the right of self-determination has not
                            exactly caught fire either. We need not, however, accept as truth the
                            version of history that the Moroccans have been promoting.</p>
                        <p>Despite what <persName corresp="#p_LA_1">Laraki</persName> said to you,
                            the division of the area between Morocco and Mauritania was quite
                            arbitrary, as the division line shows. It was not in any precise manner
                            based on tribal allegiances. (See maps at Tab A.)<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d213fn3">Tab A is attached but not printed.</note> In any
                            case, nomadic tribal allegiances have not been very stable, and the
                            dominant sentiment is one of fierce independence and disregard for such
                            niceties as frontiers.</p>

                        <p>Tom Franck’s article at Tab B summarizes the main stages leading to
                            partition of the Western Sahara.<note n="4" xml:id="d213fn4">Tab B,
                                entitled “The Spanish Sahara and Portuguese Timor as Precedent,” is
                                attached but not printed.</note> The Moroccans try to buttress their
                            case by legal arguments, but the simple fact is that they annexed the
                            territory by force. Some of the population no doubt welcomed them;
                            others fled, and now live in refugee camps in Algeria. Polisario, which
                            traces its origins to 1968, managed to win Algerian backing, and decided
                            to fight. Algeria’s motives are no doubt mixed, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> was clearly angered at the
                            way in which <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            outmaneuvered him, and he sees the Polisario, which consists of good
                            fighters who know the territory, as a low-cost way of keeping Morocco
                            off balance. The danger, of course, is that the fighting will escalate
                            to the Morocco-Algeria level.</p>
                        <p>Like most observers, I see little chance that the Moroccan fait accompli
                            can be reversed. Nor do I feel that it necessarily should be, although I
                            find the legal pretensions of the Moroccan case a bit hard to take. (I’m
                            sure the Somalis will find comparably strong arguments if and when they
                            annex Ogaden, Djibouti and parts of Kenya.)</p>
                        <p>Before King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> arrives for
                            his December 7–8 visit, it might be worth considering whether we should
                            offer our good offices to reduce the tension between Morocco and
                            Algeria. The most that we could expect <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to concede would be a limited degree of autonomy
                            for the western Sahara and reintegration of some Polisario leaders into
                            Morocco. Some symbolic act constituting self-determination—voting for
                            the regional assembly—would then have to take place. By now, that would
                            probably give <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> enough
                            to allow him to disengage as gracefully as possible from an overextended
                            position. Unlike the Arab-Israeli conflict on which we spend all our
                            time, this one is not vital to world peace. But it might still be
                            resolved, and at very little cost to us in time or effort. The Moroccans
                            claim that there is nothing to be decided, but they do seem worried
                            about developments. So the time may be ripe for getting beyond the
                            absurd legal arguments about who is right and who is wrong, and trying
                            to find a solution to a problem which needlessly distracts Morocco,
                            Mauritania and Algeria from more serious issues of development.<note

                            is on the road to a satisfactory resolution, is described in a separate
                                telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">In telegram 5950 from Rabat,

                            discuss current military situation in Sahara. He indicated he wished
                            Secretary to have this information before latter’s meeting with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> November

                        <p>2. King stated that there had been serious escalation in Sahara guerrilla
                            warfare during recent weeks. Polisario now had armored vehicles,
                            advanced automatic weapons, and large numbers of scouting vehicles.
                            Polisario’s repair capabilities were “unbelievable.” Quantities of
                            equipment in Polisario hands had increased tremendously.</p>
                        <p>3. When our people come over a dune, King continued, they might well meet
                            a wall of armor. Saharans themselves could not possibly operate this far
                            more sophisticated equipment in Polisario inventory. There was no
                            question but that regular Algerian forces were operating this equipment.
                            King wanted Secretary to know that further indication of non-Saharan
                            involvement in the fighting was recent aborted Algerian efforts in Dakar
                            to recruit Senegalese for Polisario guerrillas and President Senghor’s
                            intention to have public trial condeming this action (see Rabat 5579 for

                        <p>4. Furthermore, French intelligence from assets in Dakar had informed him
                            of significant number of new air fields in Chegga area of Mauritania,
                            near northwestern corner of Mali, and of Soviet-provided AN–12 aircraft
                            flying large quantities of equipment into that area.</p>
                        <p>5. King stated that something had to be done. He was the only one in the
                            whole area making serious effort to prevent collapse of moderate regimes
                            in Africa and ward off creeping Soviet take-over of the continent. King
                            expected recurrence of Shaba insurgency, and had had reports that
                            infiltration had already started up again.</p>
                        <p>6. King stressed that it was the U.S., and only the U.S., which could
                            effectively prevent further Soviet inroads. He recalled a statement by
                            Secretary in support of territorial integrity of Sudan, which he
                            welcomed. To ensure this integrity, however, one must be concerned about
                            the situation neighboring on Sudan. He cited Soviet-equipped <persName
                                corresp="#p_QM_1">Qadhafi</persName> in Libya, and “the virtual
                            Soviet takeover of Ethiopia,” as well as strong Soviet position in
                            Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola. After recalling his initiative in
                            Zaire, King said he could not combat the Soviets alone, especially in
                            Northwest Africa in the face of increasing Soviet military deliveries to
                            Algeria. The problem, as he saw it, was two-fold: (a) no Soviet
                            limitation on the use of arms and equipment by the Algerians and (b)
                            possible Soviet or Cuban manning of the more advanced items. On the
                            latter point, King said that he knew the Algerians were not good pilots,
                            and therefore he would not be so concerned about recently delivered
                            MiG–21’s but for possibility that non-Algerians might be flying
                            them.</p>
                        <p>7. King urged U.S. to enter discussions with Soviets to induce them to
                            stop the current Algerian escalation threatening Morocco and Mauritania.
                            Recent Sahara escalation had come about “either because people were
                            illogical or logical.” King had to assume latter, which would lead to
                            conclusion that this was part of Soviet strategy in Africa. At this
                            point, King recalled that Presidential Assistant <persName

                            conversation in Washington with former <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_LA_1">Laraki</persName>, had expressed
                            understanding of Soviet threat in Africa and support for Moroccan
                            efforts to counter this threat<note n="5" xml:id="d214fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d213fn2">footnote 2, Document 213</ref>.</note> (having
                            received no account of this conversation, I was unable to comment.)</p>
                        <p>8. King noted that Royal Counselor <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Reda
                                Guedira</persName> was currently in Paris for private meeting with
                            Giscard d’Estaing to brief him on situation and to urge France to weigh
                            in with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. A serious problem for Morocco was that its friends were in the “moral
                            camp,” King continued, with its enemies in the camp without morals. The
                            U.S. and France and other friends would undoubtedly <pb n="516"
                                facs="0537" xml:id="pg_516"/>stop deliveries of military equipment
                            in case of a serious outbreak. Morocco must therefore build up stocks in
                            self-defense, as those allied to the immoral camp would not suffer a
                            cut-off of supplies.</p>
                        <p>10. King emphasized that he would never ask the U.S. to get into another
                            Vietnam or Korea, and that Morocco would do the fighting but must have
                            the wherewithal. In this connection, he noted current visit of Deputy
                            Air Force Chief Colonel Terhzaz to Washington to discuss with U.S. Navy
                            release of six used OV–10 aircraft which he looked forward to receiving
                            soonest. As the United States well knew, Morocco would never commit
                            aggression, King continued, but it must defend itself against escalating
                            attacks from outside its borders. If the escalation continued, he would
                            have to react. He did not, however, want to be forced into a position
                            where he would have no choice but to respond with a counter offensive.
                            If Moscow could be persuaded to restrain the other side, this
                            possibility would remain academic.</p>
                        <p>11. Comment: While King studiously avoided alarmism, he clearly views
                            mounting military pressures, especially against Mauritania, as very
                            serious, and within the larger context of Soviet expansionism in Africa.
                            He therefore sees a more active U.S. role vis-a-vis the Soviets as
                            increasingly urgent.</p>

                        <p>1. During conversations before and after my October 27 meeting with King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>,<note n="2"

                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            expressed concern over military situation in Sahara and Mauritania. He
                            indicated a pronounced escalation was under way and that Moroccan forces
                            were under increasing pressure. He stressed that “one should never lose
                            one’s head, but one could not just sit back with arms folded,”
                            especially in view of the <pb n="517" facs="0538" xml:id="pg_517"
                            />emotions of the growing number of families of Moroccans killed and
                            wounded. I noted that Moroccan success on diplomatic front had no doubt
                            caused frustration for the other side, leading to increased military
                            activity. At same time, Moroccan resort to increased force, such as any
                            direct confrontation with Algeria, could detract from or even reverse
                            its diplomatic efforts in <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> and Arab
                            League. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> concurred, but
                            believed that something had to be done. He confessed, however, to be at
                            a loss as to specific moves.</p>
                        <p>2. Turning to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> situation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said Algerians were trying to
                            induce as many countries as possible to talk about Sahara in Fourth
                            Committee with a view toward having question put on UNGA agenda. Morocco
                            would be working toward same outcome at UNGA as last year, namely
                            deferring to <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> as the organization
                            already seized with the matter. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> recognized need to have a new Moroccan
                            Ambassador to <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> assigned as soon as
                            possible, and hoped for Royal decision in very near future.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> wondered what Algerian
                            game really was. I noted this was regular question from American
                            visitors, and that answer no doubt involved wide-ranging competition
                            between a revoluntionary socialist system and a progressive monarchy,
                            with Sahara having added to Algerian frustration. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> thought that Sahara was
                            expensive for Algeria, although probably more so for Morocco. He was
                            persuaded that Sahara war was not popular in Algeria, and that it would
                            be in Moroccan interest to increase the cost of the war effort for
                            Algeria so that the Algerian people would become increasingly
                            disenchanted. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said that
                            war was obviously not the way, but he did not know how to go about it.
                            At this point, he mentioned increasing diplomatic pressure in Arab,
                            African and other capitals to weaken even further Algerian pretentions
                            of Third World leadership. He also alluded to increasing U.S. economic
                            ties with Algeria which undoubtedly bolstered an economy that was not
                            working very well and certainly indirectly helped Algeria to pursue its
                            policy with the Polisario. While he did not, as had been done informally
                            with me in the past by the Prime Minister, the former Foreign Minister
                            and other key Moroccans, ask rhetorically why the U.S. did not use its
                            economic relations to force a change in Algerian policy, he had that
                            look in his eye. Frankly, I think he is bright enough to know that this
                            would be a non-starter, especially when the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> is putting the finishing touches on a long-term
                            phosphate agreement with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>4. During earlier conversation Oct. 22, which touched on recent House
                            International Relations Committee hearings on Sahara, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said that after a briefing
                            from Professor Mohammed Bennouna, who testified before the Committee, he
                            found the statement by Deputy <pb n="518" facs="0539" xml:id="pg_518"
                            />Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> a
                            good one,<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">In telegram 245767 to Rabat,
                                Algiers, and Nouakchott, October 13, the Department transmitted the
                                text of <persName corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName>’s October 12
                                statement, which set out the U.S. position of refraining from
                                “acknowledging Moroccan and Mauritanian claims to sovereignty over
                                the disputed territory, while acknowledging their administrative
                                control of the territory.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central
                                Foreign Policy File, D770373–0920)</note> but was perplexed over the
                            points made about the use of U.S. arms in the Sahara. For example, to
                            say that we did not really know much about U.S. arms in the Sahara
                            because our people do not visit the disputed areas gives ammunition to
                            the other side which can claim the U.S. questions Morocco’s right to be
                            in the territory and is therefore no longer neutral on the substance of
                            the issue. It was clear that <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName>’s problem here is that he equates sovereignty
                            with administrative control. When I pointed out <persName
                                corresp="#p_VN_1">Veliotes</persName> had stated that we
                            acknowledged latter, but have refrained from taking a position on the
                            former, he appeared to understand more clearly that part of the
                            statement on the use of U.S. arms. I then reviewed for him the
                            considerations relating to Moroccan use of U.S. equipment, pointing out
                            that our agreements contained certain restrictions, for example on where
                            such equipment might be used and on transfers to third parties.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said he was aware of
                            these points, but considered that as a general principle, Morocco might
                            obviously have to use equipment from whatever source to defend Moroccan
                            territory and that of Mauritania against externally supported
                            aggression, while having no intention to commit any aggression against
                            Algeria. If the aggression against Morocco and Mauritania ceased, he
                            concluded, the costly use of <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            military hardware would also cease.</p>
                        <p>5. Comment: <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>’s concern
                            over escalation in Sahara closely echoes that of King <persName

                                above.</note> He obviously understands that direct military moves
                            against Algeria could cause more problems than would be solved. On other
                            hand, he shares growing sense of frustration among Moroccan leadership,
                            which has not yet been able to find an effective response against
                            Algerian-Polisario military pressures.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>—Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> opened November 7
                            substantive discussion with statement that he hopes shared ideals give
                            Morocco “privileged” relation with U.S. Morocco has chosen democracy and
                            is in process of political liberalization, a trend unusual in Third
                            World and in contrast with Algerian example. Morocco has been concerned
                            by development of axis linking Moscow, Algeria, Luanda and Havana and
                            has tried in Shaba and elsewhere to use limited means at its disposal to
                            counter this axis’ activities. Turning to the Sahara conflict, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said Morocco had been both
                            colonialized and decolonialized in phases, with the decolonialization of
                            the Sahara following procedures quite common among Francophone colonies,
                            i.e., including consultation with provincial assembly. He described
                            Polisario as quote a fiction—a creation of Algeria. Unquote.</p>
                        <p>2. When <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> instructed him to raise with
                            Secretary issue of recent Polisario use of heavy weapons, Secretary
                            commented that U.S. intelligence experts have seen no such evidence.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> welcomed Secretary’s
                            suggestion that American and Moroccan intelligence experts meet.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> then elaborated on
                            Moroccan claims, stating Antonov aircraft transporting arms and men to
                            areas near Chegga, and elsewhere in Mauritania and Mali. He said that as
                            he left Rabat <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> had told
                            him Moroccan forces had seen or had recovered battle debris proving that
                            Polisario using armored cars and 23 mm artillery, which <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said must be manned by
                            Algerians and/or other non-Saharans. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> said French press has carried interview of Algerian
                            NCO captured in Mauritania who said he was one of 500 Algerian
                            artillerymen in a 600-man band which infiltrated Mauritania. Polisario
                            have been mutilating faces of their own dead when leaving corpses on
                            battlefield to prevent identification of Algerians, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said.</p>
                        <pb n="520" facs="0541" xml:id="pg_520"/>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> then indicated difficulties
                            with tank and other ammunition but said he understood these would be
                            resolved at technical level within the week. He pledged Morocco would
                            not use military weapons for aggression but added that Morocco was sure
                            of justice of its position and hoped U.S. too would be on side of
                            justice and of Morocco’s right to recover its territory.</p>
                        <p>4. In responding, Secretary said during meeting later in day with Soviet
                            Ambassador he would urge the Soviets to counsel the Algerians to
                            exercise restraint in circumstances which appear to be endangering the
                                peace.<note n="2" xml:id="d216fn2">An unknown hand placed a

                                    >Boucetta</persName>, and was concerned about the potentially
                                explosive situation in the Western Sahara. I urged the Soviet side
                                to exercise its influence with the Algerians, and warned that as
                                larger units became involved, the danger increased.” (National
                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File, P840076–0388)</note>
                            Secretary added that in meeting planned for following day with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> he would urge that Algerians
                            seek to solve the dispute through restraint and diplomacy rather than
                            military conflict. After <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            explained state of play in <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>’s Fourth

                            Secretary did not respond to <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName>’s statement that later in year Morocco may be
                            looking for U.S. to support its contention that self-determination has
                            occurred in Western Sahara should Morocco decide to try to have Western
                            Sahara deleted from agenda.<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">An unknown hand

                        <p>5. Turning to U.S. military assistance, Secretary told <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> that in spirit of frankness he
                            wanted Moroccans to be aware both practical and congressional problems
                            would have to be considered.<note n="4" xml:id="d216fn4">An unknown hand
                                placed a checkmark in the right-hand margin.</note> He cited
                            reopening of OV–10 production line as example of former and possible
                            objections of some Congressmen to use in Western Sahara of American
                            supplied military equipment as example of latter. Secretary concluded
                            that U.S. wants to be as helpful as it can be, but existence of these
                            problems makes it impossible to make any commitments before we talk to
                            Congress. <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> responded that
                            Moroccan need is great, repeated that U.S. furnished weapons would not
                            be used for aggression, but added Moroccans would defend their entire
                                territory.<note n="5" xml:id="d216fn5">An unknown hand highlighted
                                the last two sentences of this paragraph.</note></p>
                        <p>6. With respect to diplomatic situation, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> said Morocco could act with the flexibility
                            necessary, but the issue is more the preservation of Morocco’s
                            territorial integrity than self-determination. He voiced apprehension
                            that time might be running against Morocco. While Morocco’s friends are
                            studying the situation carefully, Algeria <pb n="521" facs="0542"
                                xml:id="pg_521"/>is being encouraged by their delay in taking a firm

                                this sentence.</note> He lauded as clear France’s statements on
                            Western Sahara and said a firmer U.S. position is necessary to keep
                            Algeria from going too far.</p>

                        <p>4. Replying, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> said
                            Saharans regard Moroccans and Mauritanians as occupiers of their
                            national territory and are contesting this occupation not only in the
                            Sahara but in Morocco and Mauritania. Algeria believes the material and
                            diplomatic support it furnishes Saharans is consistent with its United
                            Nations obligations. Algeria has no territorial or economic ambitions
                            and expects to return to a policy of friendship with its neighbors once
                            the conflict has been resolved on the basis of free consultation. In
                            meanwhile struggle becomes harder due to logic of oppression which
                            generates even greater resistence. Algeria believes Saharans’ situation
                            must concern the U.S., for human rights which U.S. espouses are
                            indivisible and applicable everywhere.</p>
                        <p>5. Continuing, <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> said it
                            is not Algeria’s business if Saharans fight the Moroccans and Mauritania
                            in the Western Sahara or in Morocco and Mauritania, or if in observance
                            of the rules of war the Moroccans and Mauritanians pursue the Saharans

                                I would thus find myself constrained—and I repeat, constrained—to

                                interferes with the sovereignty of neighbors. However, I say that

                            <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> stated that, although

                            on present relations. AFP had reported that French nuclear forces

                            found it strange that such a response could stem from <pb n="524"

                            technicians to Morocco. French actions (which Algeria has learned
                            included a rebuffed request from the French General Staff to the Spanish
                            Government for use of Las Palmas) have prompted two theories: (1) France
                            wants a second Algerian war—which is difficult to believe; or (2) that
                            France is encouraging Morocco to wage a second war with Algeria—which
                            Algeria has reason to believe to be true. However, although disappointed
                            by France’s attitude, Algeria does not despair and continues to hope
                            France will adopt a position suited to her regional interests rather

                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Bouteflika</persName> said in view of
                            events which had occurred since he told Secretary in Paris of Algerian
                            hopes that <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> administration
                            would help safeguard fundamental principles, and bearing in mind that

                            Concluding, he said Algeria’s borders had been defined by the blood of
                            martyrs in wars with France and Morocco and any violation of them would
                            have catastrophic consequences.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: Although Morocco and Mauritania control most of Sahara
                            militarily and enjoy reasonably solid diplomatic position, case is far
                            from closed. Polisario has developed organizational and even popular
                            base, government in exile, effective international PR effort, as well as
                            seemingly efficient fighting force. At this juncture, Mauritania is
                            hurting militarily, Morocco has felt sufficiently pressed to escalate
                            intensity of conflict, and following seizure of more French hostages,
                            France has increased its commitment to support Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>2. Despite risk of no-win Algerian-Moroccan war, we see no intention on
                            either side of abandoning hard line positions, and therefore believe
                            U.S. should stay out of conflict and maintain policy of neutrality. At
                            same time, we should remain in touch with Soviets on question as well as
                            with protagonists. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. The setting: Events in the Sahara since mid-October have escalated the
                            tension in the region to a level not seen since the immediate post-Green
                            March period in early 1976. The successful Polisario attacks at Sebkhat
                            Oum Drouss Oct 13–14 and at Zoueratt Oct 23 seem to have provoked King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s declaration of the
                            right of hot pursuit of Polisario guerillas across the Algerian
                            frontier. The Polisario’s Oct 23 kidnapping of two more French
                            tenchnicians working in Mauritania, and the apparent French decision to
                            bolster the defenses of that country, have added a new dimension to
                            conflict and given the Algerian regime both a new cause and perhaps even
                            pause for reflection. The latest attempts at mediation seem to have gone
                            nowhere, and as this telegram is written it appears that the Polisario
                            may have put the fat in the fire by launching new attacks within the
                            Sahara, in southern Morocco, and on the Zoueratt iron ore train in
                            Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>4. In this situation, we submit the following analysis of where the
                            conflict seems to us to stand, the prospects for a settlement, and how
                            the U.S. interest is affected.</p>

                        <p>5. Politico-military balance sheet in the Sahara; the dossier remains
                            open: At the second anniversary of King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s Green March into the Sahara, conflict over the
                            former colony continues unabated. Major elements in the situation
                            are:</p>
                        <p>A. Moroccan-Mauritanian position established: After two years, no amount
                            of Algerian-Polisario propaganda can disguise the fact of
                            Moroccan-Mauritanian control over the major strategic points within the
                            former colony. The strength of the Moroccan Armed Forces in and near the
                            Sahara is estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 and the Mauritanian Army has
                            grown rapidly to meet the Polisario’s challenge. Although the Moroccans
                            may have abandoned some remote outposts such as Bir Lahlou in the
                            Eastern Sahara, their control over all major towns is undisputed as is
                            their ability to retake any villages which for tactical reasons they
                            have evacuated. We have the impression that Polisario “operations”
                            against Saharan towns are very minor.</p>
                        <p>B. Moroccan-Mauritanian position strong: A major Algerian diplomatic
                            campaign has made almost no progress in breaking the virtually unanimous
                            Arab support for Moroccan-Mauritanian takeover of Sahara, and the
                            Africans and the rest of Third World, while often championing the right
                            of self-determination, seem unwilling to enter the fray. Thus, the
                            special <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> summit on Sahara has yet to
                            be held, and few countries other than the eleven that have recognized
                            Sahraoui Republic,<note n="3" xml:id="d218fn3">See <ref target="#d45fn3"
                                    >footnote 3, Document 45</ref>.</note> are prepared to be in the
                            forefront of a fight for repudiation of the Madrid Agreement and
                            condemnation of the Moroccan-Mauritanian occupation. Most Third World
                            governments seem to recognize the complications inherent in situation
                            and prefer to look the other way.</p>
                        <p>C. The Polisario alive and well: The two years since the Green March have
                            seen Algeria and the Polisario transform the latter from a small, poorly
                            armed band of several hundred into an organization possessed of a
                            “government in exile”, a political structure with representatives around
                            the world, a well organized “popular base” in the Tindouf refugee camps,
                            an effective international PR effort, an apparently efficient fighting
                            force of several thousand men. Within the military stalemate existing on
                            the ground, the Polisario has expanded the sophistication of its
                            armaments and consequently the size and scope of its operations to a
                            point at which the Mauritanian Government is hurting both militarily and
                            economically and the Moroccans are sufficiently under pressure to
                            provoke King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s November 6
                            “hot pursuit” speech.<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d217fn7">footnote 7, Document 217</ref>.</note>
                            Diplomatically the Polisario, if unsuccessful in obtaining worldwide
                            support for its cause, has at least begun making <pb n="528" facs="0549"
                                xml:id="pg_528"/>its case more effectively around the world, notably
                            in the U.S. and at the U.N. In short, the Polisario appears to be an
                            organization that will be with us for awhile.</p>
                        <p>D. Refugees: Since the Green March, the Algerians and the Polisario have
                            built a nucleus of people who left the Sahara into an impressive group
                            of refugees all apparently fired with Sahraoui nationalism and a longing
                            to return to their “homeland.” It is certain that, among these people
                            are refugees who lived in the former Spanish Sahara, who feared or were
                            made to fear the Moroccans and to a lesser extent the Mauritanians, and
                            who therefore fled to Algeria. It is only slightly less certain that the
                            camps contain a significant number of Saharans who have arrived from
                            other areas of the desert, either to escape the Sahel drought or simply
                            because the Algerians and Polisario induced them to come. Still, however
                            much one questions their origins, the refugees, thanks to a major
                            organizational effort by the Algerians and the Polisario, have become
                            for the outside world “a people” whose rights as a group must be taken
                            into consideration in a settlement of Sahara problem. Paradoxically,
                            continuation of Sahara conflict is itself developing a national identity
                            among a nomadic people who never really had much of one before.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d218fn5">An unknown hand placed a checkmark in the
                                right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note></p>
                        <p>E. France and its hostages: Following the Polisario’s taking of two
                            further French hostages in Mauritania last month, France has shown
                            herself more willing to go to Mauritania’s aid even though this has
                            meant the deterioration of <persName corresp="#p_FF_1"
                            >Franco</persName>-Algerian relations. What effect French assistance may
                            have on the sagging Mauritanian war effort remains to be seen. In
                            Algeria, it has produced a new burst of <persName corresp="#p_FF_1"
                                >Franco</persName>-phobia and has fueled the regime’s fear of a
                            Rabat-Paris axis bent on destroying the Algerian revolution. But, so
                            far, this Francophobia has not triggered any sort of violent reprisals
                            against French nationals or property in Algeria.</p>
                        <p>6. Current attitudes: At this stage of conflict, the attitudes of
                            principal players appear to us as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Algeria: Algerian Sahara policy would appear to have had some
                            short-term success even if that policy’s mid to long-term benefits to
                            Algeria are questionable. The difficulties facing Mauritania as a result
                            of Polisario activity are clear proof of guerrillas’ effectiveness, and
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s hot pursuit
                            announcement suggests that Moroccan casualties have become sufficiently
                            serious to force him to react with increased intensity. That this
                            Algerian “success” has brought Algeria and Morocco closer to a war
                            neither side wants is a point that we feel is <pb n="529" facs="0550"
                                xml:id="pg_529"/>not lost on the Algerian leadership. For the
                            moment, however, the Algerian regime is obsessed with the diplomatic
                            defeat represented by Madrid Agreement and seems totally preoccupied
                            with making the Moroccans pay for that setback.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d218fn6">An unknown hand placed a checkmark in the
                                right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note> The leadership here
                            has good reason to believe it is scoring points in this department, and
                            despite the apparent disinterest of the Algerian people to the struggle,
                            its overriding interest at the moment seems to be in keeping up the
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>B. Polisario: The Polisario’s interest in the conflict differs from the
                            Algerians’ only in that it would not appear bound by fear of an
                            Algerian-Moroccan war. Such a conflict would serve only to dramatize its
                            cause, and could produce a new situation from which it could conceivably
                            profit.</p>
                        <p>C. Morocco: It appears from our vantage point that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s commitment to his present
                            Sahara policy remains total and that of his people only slightly less
                            so. Moroccans talk from time to time of “face saving” solutions for
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>, but are
                            understandably unwilling to make any of the sort of concessions the
                            Algerians are looking for. Morocco’s continued talk of giving Algeria
                            economic concessions in a Moroccan Sahara misses the essential point
                            that the Algerian interest in conflict is geopolitical, not
                            economic.</p>
                        <p>D. Mauritania: While more directly threatened by the current state of
                            affairs in Sahara than King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>, our impression from Algiers is that the
                            Mauritanian Government’s commitment to staying with the Sahara war
                            remains high. This impression is supported by a general preception here
                            that the current state of affairs involves Ould Daddah in a struggle for
                            his political life.</p>
                        <p>7. U.S. interest: To sum up, the protagonists in the Sahara conflict seem
                            for the present committed to their present policies, and no political or
                            military solution is in sight. In this situation, we see the following
                            U.S. interests:</p>
                        <p>A. To stay out: The Sahara conflict is not one which we can reasonably
                            expect to influence nor one in which we have a vital stake.<note n="7"

                            Algeria and Morocco would touch a major American interest only if the

                            attacked, and a military victory by either Algeria or Morocco would not
                            be of crucial importance to us. We would therefore do better to limit
                            our efforts, as we have been doing, to counseling moderation. Both sides
                            have asked, and will probably continue to ask, that we play a mediatory
                            role; at the moment, <pb n="530" facs="0551" xml:id="pg_530"/>however,
                            each is committed to a policy diametrically opposed to that of the other
                            and appears interested in our “mediation” largely as a means of
                            encouraging us to exert pressure on the other and of presenting
                            statesmanlike image to the world.</p>
                        <p>B. To continue our present policies: With no political solution to
                            problem evident, our present policy of neutrality on the substance of
                            issue seems most logical. The administration seems to have succeeded in
                            convincing the Algerian regime of its neutrality in the conflict, and we
                            should strive to maintain this stance by avoiding taking positions on
                            the issue in forums such as U.N. Our present level of military
                            assistance to Morocco is accepted as a fact of life of the region. We
                            believe it best to continue it at its current contemplated level.<note

                        <p>C. To keep in touch with Soviets: A major threat to our interest would be
                            an escalation of some future Algerian-Moroccan conflict in which we and
                            the Soviets would find ouselves resupplying our respective clients. We
                            have the impression that the Soviets, perhaps because of their interest
                            in Moroccan phosphates, are more genuinely neutral on the Sahara
                            question now (see Algiers 2954)<note n="9" xml:id="d218fn9">Telegram

                            neutrality.</p>
                        <p>D. To continue high-level contact with the protagonists: To keep up with
                            possible shifts in the attitudes of the protagonists, we should continue
                            the practice of discussing the Sahara issue often with regime spokesmen
                            from both sides. The <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>

                            opportunity to discuss with you the United States’ relations with
                            Morocco and U.S. foreign policy on the situation in Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>The Subcommittee on International Organizations held a hearing on the
                            right of self-determination in Western Sahara in October of this year.
                            As you know, this issue has been discussed in the United Nations for
                            well over a decade, from the time Sahara was a Spanish colony. The
                            question has been discussed primarily in light of the United Nations
                            Charter and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
                            Countries and Peoples. The United States endorsed the 1974 General
                            Assembly resolution which put before the International Court of Justice
                            the question of Morocco’s and Mauritania’s historical and legal claims
                            to Western Sahara. In 1975 the International Court of Justice rendered
                            an advisory opinion stating, inter alia, that while there were
                            historical and legal ties among the three areas in question, this did
                            not negate the right of self-determination for the people of Western
                                Sahara.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3"><gloss target="#t_UN_1"

                        <p>Following its visit to Western Sahara in May and June of 1975, the United
                            Nations Visiting Mission reported that there was a strong consensus
                            among the Saharans favoring independence and opposing integration with
                            its neighbors.<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">For details on the report of
                                the Visiting Mission, see <hi rend="italic">Yearbook of the United
                                    Nations, 1975</hi>, pp. 177–178.</note> Since Spain’s agreement
                            to partition the Sahara between Morocco and Mauritania in November 1975,
                            fighting between Moroccan and Mauritanian troops and the liberation
                            movement, POLISARIO, has intensified in Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>The United States has supported the principle of self-determination in a
                            number of United Nations resolutions, including some specifically
                            addressing the Sahara issue. At the subcommittee hearing, the State <pb
                                n="532" facs="0553" xml:id="pg_532"/>Department official stated that
                            the United States Government’s policy on the territorial conflict in the
                            Sahara is one of neutrality.<note n="5" xml:id="d219fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d215fn3">footnote 3, Document 215</ref>.</note> Yet it
                            is unrealistic to claim a policy of neutrality on the state of war
                            existing between the POLISARIO of Western Sahara and the troops of
                            Morocco and Mauritania, given (1) the United States’ substantial
                            military assistance to Morocco and (2) United States international
                            obligations to the principle of self-determination. Our silence is
                            consequently synonymous to acquiescence to the status quo in this
                            region.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, the basis of U.S. policy (or lack of it) toward the Sahara
                            question is not to impair our very close and long-term relations with
                            Morocco. But this raises a fundamental question: Does the United States
                            refrain from expressing its ideas of supporting its international
                            obligations in cases involving a country with whom we have good
                            relations?</p>
                        <p>As you no doubt know, several provisions in the Foreign Assistance and
                            Military Sales Act and the Arms Export Control Act limit use of military
                            assistance to internal and collective defense, and prohibit such
                            assistance for acts of aggression. Given Morocco’s military activities
                            in Western Sahara, there is some serious question of whether the United
                            States, in providing military assistance to Morocco, is in violation of
                            United States law.</p>
                        <p>Given the important role of the United States in this region, I urge you
                            to discuss with King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> the
                            issues of self-determination for Western Sahara and the impact of U.S.
                            military assistance in this conflict. Apparently in the past, quiet
                            diplomatic channels were rarely, if ever, used to address this problem
                            to the Moroccan Government.</p>
                        <p>I am well aware of the increasingly delicate nature of the problems in
                            this region. But I am equally aware of the dangerous consequences of the
                            United States weakening its credibility by not being committed to its
                            international principles. This administration has already established an
                            unfortunate precedent on the question of self-determination by accepting
                            as a fait accompli Indonesia’s invasion of East Timor and by voting in
                            the Fourth Committee a few weeks ago against the United Nations
                            resolution that supports the right of self-determination in East
                            Timor.</p>
                        <p>I have little doubt that United States relations with Morocco are
                            important. Yet, given the human rights policy commitments by your
                            administration, the United States should establish with its friends and
                            foes alike that certain fundamental rights, including the right to
                            self-determination, play an integral part in formulating American
                            foreign policy.</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>In light of the upcoming visit by King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> of Morocco, I recently wrote the President a
                            letter on the question of the conflict in Western Sahara, urging him to
                            discuss with the King the issues of self-determination in the Sahara and
                            the question of U.S. military assistance to Morocco. Although I sent you
                            a copy at the time, I am enclosing another one for your
                                information.<note n="2" xml:id="d220fn2">Not attached; printed as
                                    <ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>As a follow-up to this letter, as well as subsequent meetings between the
                            subcommittee staff and U.S. government officials on this subject, I
                            thought I would put in writing some specific points and recommendations
                            on U.S. policy toward Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>United States official policy on Western Sahara remains essentially
                            unchanged from the past:</p>
                        <p>—U.S. is neutral in the conflict;</p>
                        <p>—U.S. acknowledges administrative control of Western Sahara by Mauritania
                            and Morocco without acknowledging their claims of sovereignty;</p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="0555" xml:id="pg_534"/>
                        <p>—The question of exercise of self-determination is a fair legal question,
                            but the United States does not make a judgment on it, as this would
                            prejudice a peaceful resolution of the dispute and would negatively
                            affect our relations with Morocco, as well as Algeria and
                            Mauritania;</p>
                        <p>—The United States has urged on occasion that those involved in the
                            dispute should, in resolving the problems, avail themselves of the
                            international organs as the United Nations and the Organization of
                            African Unity.</p>
                        <p>In past administrations, this official policy has been used as a facade
                            covering a posture of abstaining in actions that would upset our good
                            relations with Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The present administration, however, has committed itself to actively
                            upholding and promoting international human rights, which include the
                            right to expression of self-determination. It therefore seems important
                            that the United States Government substantiate its official policy
                            toward Western Sahara in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>—The United States should begin to make clear, through quiet diplomatic
                            channels, to the nations involved—Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria—that it
                            intends to more actively pursue, bilaterally and through the United
                            Nations organs, its public policy, than has been the case in the past;
                            that there are important differences in the manner in which the United
                            States has carried out this policy in the past and how it will be
                            carried out in the future;</p>
                        <p>—The United States strongly supports an end to the fighting in the
                            region;</p>
                        <p>—The United States supports the idea that participants in the conflict
                            work out conditions under which the people of Western Sahara can be
                            allowed to determine the status of their political future <hi
                                rend="italic">under international auspices</hi>;</p>
                        <p>—The United States should show great interest in the upcoming meeting by
                            the Organization of African Unity that will reportedly be held in Egypt
                            in March of 1978,<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">The <gloss

                            resolve the conflict in this region;</p>
                        <p>—The United States should consult with Spain and France, both of which
                            are on record as favoring self-determination and both of which take the
                            position that even the Madrid Agreement has yet to be carried out by
                            Morocco, with a view to seeing what further can be done to assist in the
                            process of self-determination;</p>
                        <pb n="535" facs="0556" xml:id="pg_535"/>
                        <p>—The United States should reiterate that U.S. law limits use of its
                            military assistance to internal and collective defense, and prohibits
                            such assistance for acts of agression.</p>

                            EQUATION</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Summary</hi></p>
                        <p>Over the past two years, the Polisario Front has created from the
                            estimated 30,000 to 80,000 Saharan refugees (not all of whom are of
                            Spanish Saharan origin) the skeleton of a state structure, mobilized and
                            politicized the population to an unexpected degree, conducted an
                            effective international public relations campaign, and—with strong
                            Algerian backing—fought Mauritania and Morocco to a military stalemate.
                            It has, in sum, become a relatively independent political and military
                            force (and in the eyes of much of the world, a “people”) that will have
                            to be reckoned with in any future settlement of the Saharan dispute.</p>
                        <p>The image of the Polisario which has appeared in the sympathetic Western
                            press—that of a noble band of refugees from the former Spanish Sahara
                            who have taken up arms to struggle for self-determination <pb n="536"
                                facs="0557" xml:id="pg_536"/>against the invading forces of an
                            occupying power—is only partly accurate. Knowledge of the Polisario
                            Front’s leadership, composition, ideology, and ultimate objectives is
                            limited, but examination of the available evidence indicates that:</p>
                        <p>—The number of refugees from the Western Sahara is greatly inflated by
                            the Polisario. A large percentage of those Saharans grouped in camps in
                            Algeria are not from the former Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—The traditionally independent and warlike Reguibat tribe, including many
                            members from Mauritania, Algeria, and Morocco, makes up the backbone of
                            the Polisario leadership and rank and file.</p>
                        <p>—The type of nationalism which motivates the Saharan population,
                            excluding its leadership, is probably more akin to Reguibat/Saharan
                            yearning for freedom from external domination than to a specific
                            nationalism tied to the artificial boundaries of what was once the
                            Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—Polisario leaders, at least some of whom are leftist dissidents from
                            Mauritania and Morocco, are ideological allies of Algeria; their goals
                            probably include the toppling of the Ould Daddah regime in
                            Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>It is also clear that Algeria has used the Polisario to punish its former
                            ally Mauritania for “betrayal” and to cripple Morocco, its only
                            geopolitical competitor in the region. The extent to which Algeria is
                            involved directly in Polisario military operations is not known, but the
                            evidence suggests that Algerian advisers accompany the Polisario on
                            missions and that many of them actually command various Polisario units.
                            In addition, large numbers of Polisario soldiers appear to have been
                            recruited from Saharans who were not originally from the former Spanish
                            Sahara.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Origins of the Polisario Front</p>
                        <p>The Polisario Front was created in May 1973 from a melange of obscure
                            Saharan nationalist and tribal groups whose principal goal was the
                            independence of the Spanish Sahara. Its political manifesto announced
                            that the Polisario, the sole representative of the Saharan people:</p>
                        <p>—had chosen “revolutionary power and military action” as the only means
                            to liberate the Saharan people; and</p>
                        <p>—was a part of the Arab revolution and considered cooperation with the
                            Algerian revolution essential in the struggle to protect the Third World
                            from aggression.</p>
                        <p>Little is known about how the Polisario makes decisions, but the ruling
                            structure apparently went through an initial stage of rather broad
                            collegial leadership. The Front’s organizational framework, <pb n="537"
                                facs="0558" xml:id="pg_537"/>established at its 1974 Congress,
                            includes a 24-man executive committee, a six-man directorate divided
                            into political and military wings, and a Secretary General.
                            Decisionmaking within the Polisario is probably informal and based on
                            the consensus of a handful of key leaders, among whom the Secretary
                            General, Mohamed Abdelaziz, appears to play a dominant role.</p>
                        <p>The leadership of the Polisario Front has been composed of relatively
                            young Saharans (not necessarily of Spanish Saharan birth), many of
                            whom—including El Ouali, Polisario founder and leader until his death in
                            June 1976—had been students in Morocco, where their leftist political
                            views and association with Moroccan leftists made them suspect to the
                            authorities. In the absence of long-term support from Morocco, the
                            Polisario leadership turned to Libya and Algeria, both sympathetic to
                            the Polisario ideology. Algeria, increasingly alarmed at Morocco’s
                            irredentist policy toward the Spanish Sahara, quickly assumed a major
                            supporting role for the Polisario.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Military Campaign</p>
                        <p>Polisario guerrillas conducted small attacks against isolated Spanish
                            outposts throughout 1974 and 1975. Following the tripartite agreement
                            signed in Madrid in November 1975, in which Spain ceded administrative
                            control to Morocco and Mauritania, Spanish forces gradually withdrew
                            from the Saharan interior. Polisario guerrillas moved into the resulting
                            vacuum with Algerian logistic support and temporarily controlled much of
                            the eastern and southern portions of the former Spanish colony.</p>
                        <p>As Moroccan and Mauritanian troops advanced into the territory, Polisario
                            guerrillas directed their attacks against these forces, but by early
                            1976 the guerrillas were forced to abandon virtually all of their fixed
                            strongpoints in the Sahara. The Polisario has continued, however, to
                            wage an effective guerrilla campaign from bases in Algeria. Over the
                            past 18 months it has concentrated its attacks against economic and
                            military targets in Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>Estimates of guerrilla strength vary from 3,000 to 6,000 combatants.
                            Although the Polisario Front depends mainly on Algeria for arms,
                            training, and supplies, Libya has also been a source of weapons and
                            financial support. Moroccan claims, some of which are based on reports
                            from Polisario defectors, that Cuban advisers are providing training for
                            the guerrillas in Algeria have not been confirmed. Weapons in the
                            Polisario inventory, for the most part of Soviet origin, include small
                            arms, land mines, machine guns, grenade launchers, and shoulder-fired
                            SA–7’s.</p>
                        <p>The guerrilla units, rather than attempting to gain control of population
                            centers, have concentrated on quick, sharp attacks on Moroccan <pb
                                n="538" facs="0559" xml:id="pg_538"/>and Mauritanian outposts and
                            military columns. Familiar with the terrain and accustomed to the harsh
                            desert climate, they have been able to evade the conventional forces of
                            their opponents. Their use of Land Rovers has enabled them to move long
                            distances over rugged terrain and to range freely throughout the Western
                            Sahara and northern Mauritania. Evidence over the past six months
                            suggests that the units have improved their command and control and
                            their communications capability. This has apparently enabled them to
                            operate more effectively in larger units, as demonstrated in successful
                            attacks against economic targets in northern Mauritania and ambushes of
                            Moroccan military columns.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Saharan Republic</p>
                        <p>On February 27, 1976, the day following Spain’s formal withdrawal from
                            the territory, the Polisario announced the creation of a
                            government-in-exile, the Saharan Democratic Arab Republic (SDAR). The
                            creation of the SDAR was clearly intended to counter the vote of the
                            Moroccan-dominated rump session of the former Saharan territorial
                            assembly, the <hi rend="italic">Jemaa</hi>, which on the previous day
                            had endorsed a motion to integrate the Sahara into Morocco and
                            Mauritania. The SDAR has a nine-man cabinet (of little-known figures), a
                            revolutionary council, and a legislative body.</p>
                        <p>Algerian and Polisario efforts to obtain recognition of the SDAR have
                            been relatively unsuccessful. Thus far, only Algeria, nine African
                            states, and North Korea have extended diplomatic recognition. It is
                            doubtful that many of the governments which recognized the SDAR knew
                            much about it at the time. Most probably they acted out of solidarity
                            with Algeria or because the Polisario’s cause looked more “progressive”
                            than that of Morocco and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Who Are the Saharan People?</p>
                        <p>The Polisario Front recruits its cadres and soldiers from among the
                            Saharan tribesmen gathered, for the most part, in the Tindouf area of
                            Algeria. The precise numbers and origins of these tribesmen are much
                            disputed.</p>
                        <p>—A 1974 Spanish census determined that there were only 74,000 indigenous
                            Saharans in all of the Spanish Sahara.</p>
                        <p>—Algeria and the Polisario publicly claim that there are over 100,000
                            refugees from the Western Sahara. The steadfast refusal of Algeria to
                            permit an accurate survey of the numbers and origin of the population
                            gathered in the camps around Tindouf makes these claims suspect.</p>
                        <p>—Morocco, for its part, claims that there are no more than 15,000 “real”
                            former inhabitants of the Western Sahara, most of whom were lured or
                            “escorted” there by Polisario guerrillas, and many of whom are currently
                            being kept there against their will by Polisario guards. Morocco cites
                            the testimony of occasional Saharans who have fled the camps and
                            returned to Moroccan-controlled towns as evidence of its claims.</p>
                        <p>The nomadic nature of the Saharans, who traditionally have disregarded
                            national boundaries, makes the population in the area fluctuate widely,
                            depending on seasonal and climatic conditions. It is clear, however,
                            that in the past two years Algeria and the Polisario have gathered a
                            body of perhaps 30,000 to 80,000 Saharans capable of demonstrating
                            impressively before foreign observers their desire for freedom and a
                            return to a Saharan “homeland.” This number includes those <pb n="540"
                                facs="0561" xml:id="pg_540"/>persons who lived in the former Spanish
                            Sahara and feared, or were made to fear, the Moroccans and Mauritanians
                            as they occupied the territory and who therefore fled to Algeria. The
                            refugee camps there also contain a significant number (conceivably even
                            a majority) of Saharans who arrived from other areas of the desert
                            (Algeria, Mauritania, Mali, and even Morocco), either to escape the
                            Sahel drought or because Algerian and Polisario spokesmen induced them
                            to come.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Reguibat Tribe: Backbone of the Polisario</p>
                        <p>At least seven of the known Polisario leaders (including the Secretary
                            General), as well as much of the rank and file, are members of the
                            Reguibat tribe, one of the most powerful of the Saharan peoples. The
                            tribe, which is found in much of the Western Sahara, as well as in parts
                            of Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, and Mali, may number as <pb n="541"
                                facs="0562" xml:id="pg_541"/>many as 300,000 members when all of its
                            relations through inter-marriage are counted. The Reguibats are known
                            for their ferocity, pride, ability with firearms, and remarkable desert
                            tracking ability. They apparently are united in opposition to the
                            Sahara’s annexation by Morocco and Mauritania because of:</p>
                        <p>—their traditional resistance to external domination; and</p>
                        <p>—the heavy-handed manner in which Morocco moved into the Western Sahara,
                            involving the mistreatment of members of the Reguibat tribe.</p>
                        <p>The Reguibat from the former Spanish Sahara (perhaps one-third of the
                            territory’s population) and other Saharans recruited from the population
                            of other countries (principally Mauritania) have given the Polisario
                            guerrilla units a source of manpower skilled in the ways of desert
                            warfare.</p>
                        <p>A large portion of the 2,500 Saharans (mainly Reguibats) who served with
                            Spanish troops in the colony also joined the guerrillas. In addition,
                            the Polisario apparently has had little trouble recruiting and
                            indoctrinating young Saharans who wish to follow the “noble” pursuit of
                            arms. Benefiting from Algerian sanctuary, extensive materiel and
                            logistics support, and advisory assistance (the extent of which is
                            unknown), the Polisario has been able to fight Morocco and Mauritania to
                            a draw and force them on the defensive in much of the Western Sahara and
                            northern Mauritania.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Politicization of the Refugees</p>
                        <p>Algeria and the Polisario leadership have undertaken a program of
                            indoctrination of the Saharan refugees in Algeria. The refugees, grouped
                            into 20–30 camps, are undergoing political and military training aimed
                            at preparing them to return to an independent Saharan state. They are
                            also being taught an Islamic-based mixture of Marxism and
                            pan-Arabism.</p>
                        <p>The extent to which the Polisario leadership has been able to create a
                            sense of genuine national identity among a nomadic people who have
                            roamed freely for many centuries is not known. The type of nationalism
                            which motivates the Polisario rank and file is probably more akin to the
                            Reguibat/Saharan yearning for freedom than to a specific nationalism
                            tied to the artificial boundaries of what was once the Spanish Sahara.
                            Nevertheless, the Saharans have become, in the eyes of much of the
                            world, a “people” whose rights as a group must be taken into
                            consideration in any settlement of the Saharan issue.</p>

                            press. Numerous journalists in search of a good story have been given
                            carefully structured tours of Polisario refugee camps. These tours have
                            emphasized the abject living conditions of the refugees, but they have
                            also highlighted the refugees’ high morale (generally manifested by
                            orchestrated popular demonstrations) and their determination to continue
                            the struggle for independence. Many correspondents have also been taken
                            along on guerrilla raids deep into Moroccan or Mauritanian zones, where
                            they have witnessed Polisario attacks on the outposts of the
                            “invaders.”</p>
                        <p>Most journalists have commented favorably on the valor, determination,
                            and martial skills of the guerrillas. The press reports thus have kept
                            the Polisario in the news despite the fact that most governments have
                            ignored the plight of the refugees and their claim to an independent

                            contributed to these Polisario successes:</p>
                        <p>—persistent efforts of Polisario diplomats backed by the full weight of
                            Algerian diplomacy;</p>

                        <p>—success of the public relations campaign, noted above; and</p>
                        <p>—the Polisario’s growing military capabilities, which, with strong
                            Algerian support, have demonstrated to the world that the Saharan
                            guerrillas cannot be defeated easily and will not wither away as a
                            source of tension and potential conflict in northwest Africa.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Who Controls the Polisario?</p>
                        <p>The Moroccans and the Mauritanians maintain that the Polisario, led
                            primarily by renegade Moroccan and Mauritanian leftists, is a tool of
                            Algeria and would have no life of its own if Algerian support were to be

                            are supplying equipment and sanctuary for the Polisario out of respect
                            for the “sacred cause” of self-determination which is being fought by an
                            independent group of Saharan patriots over whom they exercise no
                            control.</p>

                        <p>Analysis of the available evidence points to the following
                            conclusions:</p>
                        <p>—Algeria is using the Polisario guerrillas to weaken Morocco, its only
                            competitor in the region, and to punish Mauritania, which prior to the
                            Sahara dispute had been a close ally of Algeria, for its “betrayal.”</p>
                        <p>—Without Algerian sanctuary and materiel support, Polisario military
                            operations against Morocco and Mauritania would subside to “manageable”
                            levels within a few months. However, the guerrillas could probably
                            continue their harassing raids in the interior of the territory for
                            several years, especially if alternative sources of weapons (Libya, for
                            example) were found.</p>
                        <p>—The Polisario leadership, with a strong following within the Saharan
                            refugee population, has formed an independent entity with its own
                            interests and objectives.</p>
                        <p>The actual political leadership of the Polisario Front is probably a
                            relatively small number of Saharan militants, ideologically sympathetic
                            to Algeria, whose aspirations for, and commitment to, an independent
                            Saharan state are genuine. There is mounting evidence, however, that
                            this leadership has wider territorial and ideological aspirations. As
                            early as 1975, Polisario leaders sought the creation of an extensive
                            Saharan state centered on Mauritania. This aspiration probably reflects
                            the strong influence of exiled Mauritanians within the movement and the
                            growing numbers of Mauritanian Saharans in the refugee camps. A major
                            objective of the June 1976 assault on the Mauritanian capital and the
                            subsequent efforts to cripple the Mauritanian economy was apparently not
                            only to force Mauritania out of the war but also to try to topple the
                            Ould Daddah regime and to replace it with an Islamic socialist republic
                            ideologically aligned with Algeria.</p>
                        <p>The extent to which Algeria has participated in the formulation of the
                            Polisario’s goals and strategy is unknown. It is apparent, however, that
                            Algeria’s motives go beyond a concern for the rights of the Saharans to
                            self-determination. In many respects, the objectives of the Polisario
                            are consistent with apparent Algerian regional goals. At a minimum, it
                            is fair to assume that the Polisario’s repeated efforts to disrupt the
                            Mauritanian economy would not take place without Algerian acquiescence,
                            if not encouragement. The French have cited circumstantial evidence
                            pointing to a major Algerian role in the formulation of the overall
                            Polisario military strategy, and there are indications that Algerian
                            military advisers are playing an important role in guerrilla military
                            operations and may even be commanding units participating in guerrilla
                            operations within the Sahara and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>Algeria is using a powerful group of Saharan nationalists for its own
                            national purposes. Their common objectives, however, should not obscure
                            the existence of the Polisario leadership’s separate interests.</p>

                        <p>We need to decide how to respond to the Moroccan Government’s request to
                            obtain from U.S. sources military equipment and training that would be
                            used in the western Sahara and Mauritania against the Algerian-supported
                            guerrillas of the Polisario Front.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">ESSENTIAL FACTORS</p>
                        <p>On September 13 then Moroccan Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LA_1">Laraki</persName> gave you his Government’s
                            request for additional U.S. military assistance (Attachment 3). The
                            Moroccan Ambassador subsequently suggested his Government wanted the
                            weapons for defensive purposes along the Moroccan-Algerian border.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">See <ref target="#d152">Document
                                152</ref>.</note> But through various sources, including the current
                            Foreign Minister, it has become clear that the intended use is for the
                            western Sahara and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>The Moroccan request poses legal problems. These are described at
                            Attachment 2. Briefly, the question is whether our supply of training or
                            equipment for Moroccan use against the Polisario in the western Sahara
                            and Mauritania is possible under the provisions of the Arms Export
                            Control Act and the terms of our classified bilateral military
                            assistance agreement with Morocco. The combined current effect of these
                            two documents is to restrict the use of American-furnished equipment
                            solely to the defense of the Kingdom of Morocco. We have accepted
                            Moroccan <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> administration of the Sahara
                            territory under the tripartite (Spain-Morocco-Mauritania) accord of
                            1975. But we do not recognize Moroccan claims to sovereignty over Sahara
                            territory, which was acquired without an expression of
                            self-determination called for by UNGA resolutions and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICJ_1">ICJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="545" facs="0566" xml:id="pg_545"/>
                        <p>If our arms will, in fact, be used to consolidate the annexation of
                            western Sahara without regard to self-determination, the proposed sale
                            will not be consistent with the Arms Export Control Act because such
                            consolidation will constitute neither “legitimate self-defense” nor
                            “internal security”, the relevant purposes authorized by the Arms Export
                            Control Act.</p>
                        <p>To overcome the less serious territorial aspect of the legal problems we
                            could amend our bilateral agreement via an exchange of notes to permit
                            use of American-supplied arms in areas subject to Moroccan
                            administrative control and in northwest African nations with which
                            Morocco has collective defense arrangements. (Morocco has such an
                            agreement with Mauritania.)</p>
                        <p>Congress must be informed if our agreement is to be amended to permit the
                            Moroccans to obtain military equipment and training for use outside the
                            Moroccan borders we recognize. Congress also will have to be notified of
                            some specific sales. The Moroccans would have their Congressional
                            supporters—for they are fighting an externally-based guerrilla group
                            supplied with Soviet arms by the Algerians and the Libyans. Moroccan
                            attitudes on the Middle East also are appreciated by Israel’s friends on
                            the Hill, who would be quite helpful given <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s public backing of <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName>’s peace initiative. It is doubtful Congress
                            actually would block the proposed sales.</p>
                        <p>The Moroccan Government recently was criticized sharply by Amnesty
                            International for its alleged violations of the human rights of its

                            has been almost uniquely cooperative in military and intelligence
                            matters, e.g., permitting us to maintain bases in Morocco and to
                            schedule regular visits by nuclear-powered warships. He partitioned the
                            Sahara with Mauritania to repossess territory most Moroccans believe was
                            stripped from Morocco during the colonial era. The move won him
                            universal domestic acclaim, but failure to hold on to the area could
                            cost him his throne. He knows his request poses problems for us. But he
                            expects us to overcome these obstacles. Should we prove totally
                            unresponsive, his disappointment will cast a shadow over bilateral
                            relations for some time to come.</p>
                        <p>Your decision on this issue will also affect the use of U.S. military
                            equipment already furnished the Moroccans under our military assistance
                            programs. An affirmative response to the current request would imply
                            consent for the Moroccans to employ previously-furnished equipment more
                            extensively in the western Sahara and Mauritania as the war continues.

                            would not be prudent to raise with Congress the issue of the arms
                            request until the possibility of a negotiated settlement has been

                        <p>—Should the Algerians reject mediation efforts, chances would be better

                        <p>—There is, at best, only a modest hope that the U.S. could facilitate a

                            soon.</p>
                        <p>—The Moroccans quickly would perceive that we were stalling, and strain
                            would develop rapidly in our bilateral relations, with a consequent
                            adverse effect on U.S. interests in Morocco, and on our relations with

                        <p>2. Western Sahara was principal subject of conversation during
                            Secretary’s March 11 working lunch with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>. Latter opened with statement
                            that he welcomed chance discuss not only bilateral issues but problems
                            which could impact on bilateral relations. On the Sahara, declarations
                            had been made by responsible U.S. officials which, if repeated, risked
                            creating situation which could encourage some sectors of international
                            opinion to believe there had been a change in U.S. position. Minister
                            then outlined in detail history of colonization and decolonization of
                            Morocco, emphasizing fragmentary nature of each process, and <persName

                            peaceful means to accomplish decolonization.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to the Sahara, <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                                >Boucetta</persName> continued, King had been similarly prudent,
                            becoming engaged only after obtaining a clear expression of Algeria’s
                            position at 1974 Rabat Summit conference,<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">In
                                telegram 5253 from Rabat, October 29, 1974, the Embassy summarized
                                the proceedings of the Arab League Summit, which focused primarily
                                on the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>, but also addressed the
                                Western Sahara: “On Sahara, conference reportedly decided to support

                                with this and abstain from any unilateral measure which might harm
                                traditional and fruitful Spanish-Arab friendship.” (National

                            when <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> stated his
                            country had no territorial claims and agreed to the parts of the Sahara
                            which would go to Morocco and Mauritania. Spain subsequently tried to
                            create a state that everyone realized would not be viable, and Green
                            March occurred. <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in 1975 had required
                            that sovereignty be resolved by interested parties. <gloss

                            <pb n="551" facs="0572" xml:id="pg_551"/>ruled there existed between
                            Saharan population and Morocco ties of allegiance which, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>, could have no significance
                            other than sovereignty. At time of Green March Security Council passed
                            three resolutions urging parties to negotiate, and Madrid Accord signed.
                            By its terms, continued <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>,
                            Spain ceded all responsibilities and powers and agreement stated that
                            the political desires of the Saharan population would be expressed by
                            the Jema’a.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> described February
                            1976 Jema’a action as consistent with the procedure by which all
                            Francophone African countries acceded to independence and said it was
                            similar also to procedure employed in West Irian with approval of UNGA,
                            and support of Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria. When Spain gave up its
                            powers, Morocco took them up, thus acquiring all the attributes of
                            sovereignty. This was reaffirmed in subsequent local and professional
                            body elections, as well as in the election of seven (and nomination of
                            two additional) representatives from the Sahara to Morocco’s national
                            legislature. In stating there is a difference between sovereignty and
                            administrative control, <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> is
                            encouraging some sectors of international opinion to adopt erroneous
                            ideas regarding Morocco’s sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>5. Commenting that foregoing had been merely legal aspects of an
                            essentially political problem, <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> said Morocco had chosen free world in which to live,
                            but efforts are being made to destabilize Northwest Africa, e.g., in
                            Canaries and Mauritania, which is weak link in chain, perhaps to
                            recreate situations like Angola and Horn. Morocco hopes its situation
                            will be understood in Washington, where a decision had been taken which
                            Morocco hopes would be only temporary. A problem would be created, he
                            concluded, if the distinction between sovereignty and administrative
                            control were to be repeated by responsible U.S. officials.</p>
                        <p>6. Responding, Secretary reminded <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has
                            remained neutral in its public position on Sahara dispute. Prior to
                            decision to which <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            referred, administration had consulted extensively with leadership of
                            Congress and decided not to try to proceed with OV–10 and helicopter
                            sales because they would have been rejected by Congress, because these
                            arms would have been used beyond Morocco’s borders. Secretary said he
                            wanted make clear that restriction of 1960 agreement regarding use
                            outside Morocco’s borders<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">The 1960 bilateral

                            time to do so. Administration strongly supports regular 45 million dols

                            to it; and Secretary continued, in his opinion, Congress will approve
                            it.</p>
                        <p>7. At Secretary’s suggestion, <persName corresp="#p_VN_1"
                                >Veliotes</persName> then briefed <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1"
                                >FonMin</gloss> in more detail on congressional consultations,
                            emphasizing opposition of key committee chairmen. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> described conversation in
                            which he said Senator Clark indicated he might call Secretary to mention
                            changed view; and Secretary replied Clark had not discussed subject in
                            recent meeting. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>
                            commented that recent visits of U.S. legislators left Moroccans with
                            impression they enjoyed more support in Congress than Department
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> arms
                            decision should not be misinterpreted as reflecting lack of U.S. support
                            for Morocco. In both administration and Congress there are strong
                            feelings regarding importance of bilateral relations and great
                            admiration for <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s courage.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> expressed
                            appreciation, then repeated that <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            unable understand distinction U.S. making between administrative control
                            and sovereignty, as <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> recognizes only
                            one Morocco. He assured Secretary U.S. arms would never be used for
                            aggression, only defense. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1"
                                >Bengelloun</persName> then attacked Algeria for efforts to achieve
                            regional hegemony.</p>
                        <p>9. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> described
                            one of his first conversations with King in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> said he would not place U.S.,
                            France, or other countries which had supported him in a difficult
                            position on Sahara. Prime Minister Osman had told the President last
                            December Morocco wanted diplomatic and moral support.<note n="4"

                            In requesting <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> in essence to

                            taken. He then repeated suggestion made earlier in week to <persName

                            formula, perhaps with assistance of a prestigious, neutral group, to

                            resolutions of doubtful enforcibility in current situations.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> replied that no other
                            government had taken public position similar to that of U.S.; Spanish
                            Government had recently signed fishing accord which acknowledged
                            Moroccan sovereignty in waters off Sahara; and no government is

                            Minister: Sahara.</p>
                        <p>1. At March 12 follow-up meeting (see septels for other details)
                            Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> that
                            although he would look himself at background to Sahara situation it was
                            clear there could be no change during 1978 on OV–10s and Cobras.<note

                            his concern about use of F–5s in Sahara. Stating that certain
                            Congressmen who are aware F–5s are there may use this knowledge to try
                            to defeat arms package for Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> added there <pb
                                n="554" facs="0575" xml:id="pg_554"/>had been numerous press reports
                            about presence of F–5s in Sahara as well as in Mauritania, and that
                            these Members of Congress and their staffs, focusing on our relations
                            with Morocco, were well aware of them. Secretary then explained that
                            some Congressmen claim F–15s sold to Saudis will be used against Israel,
                            and Department has been arguing that U.S. would impose restrictions
                            prohibiting such use. Congressional opponents might well cite presence
                            of F–5s in Mauritania and Sahara as evidence such restrictions are
                            ineffective.</p>
                        <p>2. Continuing, Secretary said he also concerned that in current week’s
                            markup of 45 million dols <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> program
                            for Morocco some Congressmen may claim presence of F–5s and other
                            U.S.-furnished equipment outside Morocco require imposition of
                            restrictive amendments to <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>
                            legislation. Secretary said he did not wish see any obstacle created for
                            traditional military sales program, which he valued in our relations and
                            wished to see continue.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> said he thought these
                            were matters which would not arise unless stirred up. Noting that no one
                            had brought them up before, he saw no need to bring them up now.
                            Continuing, <gloss target="#t_FonMin_1">FonMin</gloss> commented he
                            could not state that there was a difference between two parts of
                            Morocco—Morocco with and Morocco without the Sahara. With the passage of
                            time, and with no questions asked, problem would take care of itself.
                            Morocco needs U.S. help, he said, but not at expense of its basic
                            principles. (In separate conversation with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> previous evening on limitation
                            of use of U.S. arms imposed by 1960 agreement, a troubled <persName
                                corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName> reiterated non-aggressive,
                            purely defensive purposes, and went on to say that if Morocco could not
                            use U.S. equipment for these purposes, it would have no choice but “to
                            take other dispositions”; even though it preferred to retain its close
                            military relationship with the U.S.)</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary said Department understands subject will be raised, and that
                            it will be used against MidEast arms package. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AR_1">Anderson</persName> added that the Congress had
                            already raised these issues; after <persName corresp="#p_VN_1"
                                >Veliotes</persName>’ recent appearance at committee hearings,
                            Department had been given about thirty supplementary questions to answer
                            for record, and use of U.S. equipment outside Morocco is raised in these
                            questions. Secretary suggested Department and Moroccan Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> work together to

                        <p>1. Department is concerned that Algerians may misinterpret negative
                            decision on Moroccan request for arms to use in the Sahara as signalling
                            estrangement between Rabat and Washington. While we cannot preclude
                            Algiers taking this position in its own media—to embarrassment of
                            Moroccans who complained of Algerian media misinterpretations during
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Boucetta</persName>’s talks
                            in Washington—Department does want to disabuse Algerians of any real
                            misunderstanding concerning relations between U.S. and Morocco. We do
                            not want to give Algerians any reason to conclude that U.S. would be
                            less concerned by any step up in Polisario attacks against Morocco or
                            Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador should seek appointment at Foreign Ministry during which he
                            should make following points:</p>
                        <p>—Following consultations with Congress, the administration has decided
                            not to sell at this time arms to the Moroccan Government for use in the
                            Western Sahara and Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. plans to continue its traditional military supply relationship
                            with Morocco.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. is aware that the Algerian Government is providing military
                            assistance to the Polisario movement and does not believe this
                            encouragement of the Polisario’s attacks on Algeria’s neighbors either
                            promotes a peaceful settlement of the Sahara dispute or furthers the
                            interests of peace in the region.</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. remains firm in its advocacy of a peaceful settlement and will
                            continue to urge the nations involved to exercise restraint.</p>

                            to him like neutrality. He asserted that the Western Sahara was
                            territory occupied by force by Morocco and Mauritania in a manner
                            contrary to accepted international practice and contrary to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution on the issue. He regretted
                            “that the U.S. interpreted erroneously the legitimate attempt by the
                            Saharan people to assert their right to self-determination.” If peace
                            was menaced, he said, it was not because of the legitimate defense of
                            the Saharan people of their rights but rather because of the genocide
                            perpetrated by Morocco and Mauritania. He said he saw Charge’s
                            presentation as a new pressure applied to Algeria and he asked
                            clarification of “this new manner of characterizing the situation in the
                            Western Sahara; this unreal interpretation.” He asserted that he saw the
                            presentation as a negative element in the search for a peaceful solution
                            of the Western Sahara problem. “This does not reassure us”, . . . he
                            said; “We ask if the United States really wants peace in the region . .
                            . the U.S. cannot speak of neutrality if it continues to arm
                            Morocco.”</p>
                        <p>2. Charge handed aide memoire to Kherbi during course of conversation.
                            Kherbi remarked that he found document superfluous and unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>3. In amicable give and take following Kherbi’s initial strong reaction,
                            Charge emphasized that presentation of points represented nothing new
                            regarding U.S. position; that facts of case were clear: Algerian <pb
                                n="557" facs="0578" xml:id="pg_557"/>provision of military
                            assistance to Polisario and Polisario attacks against Mauritania and
                            Morocco. Charge noted that perhaps no U.S. official had described
                            situation in Western Sahara in those terms before but said that did not
                            change facts. Charge said purpose of our making points to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> was to be absolutely certain that U.S.
                            administration’s decision not to sell arms at this time to Morocco for
                            use in Western Sahara and Mauritania would not be misinterpreted by
                            anyone as a change either in our position of strict neutrality or in our
                            advocacy of and strong desire for a peaceful settlement of the Western
                            Sahara problem.</p>
                        <p>4. Comment: Embassy has shared Department’s concern that Algerians might
                            misinterpret negative decision on Morocco’s request for arms (para 1
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>). For this reason
                            Ambassador stressed to Presidential Counselor Ismail Hamdani prior to
                            Ambassador’s departure on leave 14 March that negative decision changed
                            in no way our neutral stance on the Sahara issue and had no bearing on
                            our traditional military supply relationship with Morocco. Other Embassy
                            officers also have made these points in their conversations with
                            Algerian officials.</p>
                        <p>5. Kherbi’s agitation at presentation was in contrast to
                            uncommunicativeness with which he normally receives our demarches.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary. Director General for Political Affairs of <gloss
                                target="#t_MFA_1">MFA</gloss> followed up on most recent <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> demarche on Western Sahara in meeting
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1">Haynes</persName>. In
                            course of this followup meeting, he cautiously indicated <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> willingness to embark on negotiated
                            political settlement of Sahara conflict. However, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> insists on Polisario participation in
                                <pb n="558" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_558"/>any such negotiations and
                            commits itself to accept any solution agreed to by the Polisario.
                            Implicit in <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> approach is a <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> role in bringing parties together and
                            mediating in negotiations. Director General promised to contact
                            Ambassador again in few days after further consultations with Polisario.
                            Our recommendation to Dept will be made after this next contact. End
                            summary.</p>
                        <p>2. Director General for Political Affairs in <gloss target="#t_MFA_1"
                                >MFA</gloss>, Abdelkader Bousselham, called me in on Wednesday,
                            March 29, for followup discussion of March 26 demarche (see reftels)
                            made by Charge d’Affaires in my absence. Bousselham opened discussion by
                            stating <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> recognized two substantive
                            elements in U.S. demarche: (a) explanation of U.S. decision not to sell
                            arms to Morocco for use in Western Sahara and Mauritania and (b)
                            criticism of <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> support of
                            Polisario.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to first element of U.S. demarche, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> wants <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> to know that it considers decision not to furnish arms
                            to Morocco as a wise and courageous move that can only contribute to the
                            achievement of peace in the region. In this sense, Bousselham said,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> appreciates and welcomes the
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>4. However, with respect to the second element of the U.S. demarche,
                            Bousselham said <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> no longer considers
                            it productive to repeatedly restate rationale for its support of
                            Polisario or to debate whether the Polisario or the Moroccans are the
                            aggressors in the Sahara. What is significant, Bousselham said, is that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> recognizes that, practically
                            speaking, no military solution is possible in the Sahara. Bousselham
                            said his government recognizes that the only enduring solution is a
                            political one and that, furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1"
                                >GOA</gloss> wants its friends to help the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1"
                                >GOA</gloss> find that political solution.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d227fn3">An unknown hand placed a checkmark in the
                                right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note> However, he
                            emphasized that any political solution must be reached with the
                            participation of the Polisario. Whatever the Polisario accepts as a
                            solution will be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss>,
                            Bousselham concluded.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked Bousselham if I was correct in inferring that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> was ready to participate in
                            negotiations for a settlement of the Sahara conflict around the
                            conference table with all the interested parties, namely the Polisario,
                            the Moroccans and the Mauritanians. In principle, Bousselham said, this
                            was the case, but he asked me to wait a few days before advising the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>. He claimed he needed the time
                            to sound out the Polisario on their readiness to negotiate.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d227fn4">An unknown hand placed a checkmark in the
                                right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note> He also labelled as
                                <pb n="559" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_559"/>false the rumors
                            circulating in past weeks that <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> had already been sounding each
                            other out on such negotiations.<note n="5" xml:id="d227fn5">See <ref
                                    target="#d228">Document 228</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>6. I asked Bousselham if he would speculate on the ground-rules for such
                            a meeting that would be acceptable to all parties. He speculated that
                            such negotiations would have to be preceded by a preliminary meeting of
                            the interested parties on neutral territory such as at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> in New York. However, he further
                            speculated that all parties to the preliminary meeting would have to
                            agree to honor its secrecy. He felt safe in guaranteeing that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> and the Polisario would abide by a
                            condition of secrecy. He agreed with my stated assumption that the
                            purpose of a secret preliminary meeting on neutral turf would be to
                            hammer out an agenda for the negotiations to follow.</p>
                        <p>7. As has been the case with all my recent discussions with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> functionaries, Bousselham concluded
                            our discussion of a possible political solution to the Sahara conflict
                            with a reminder of the importance to the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1"
                                >GOA</gloss> of continued improvement in <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-Algerian relations. He said, “we are called upon to
                            travel a long road together and we share a common goal of improving our
                            relations in all areas while scrupulously avoiding
                            misunderstandings.”</p>
                        <p>8. In closing, Bousselham expressed his personal pleasure over the
                            nomination of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David
                                Newsom</persName> for the post of Under Secretary for Political
                            Affairs. He said, “in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1"
                                >Newsom</persName>, we will have a man who understands the
                            Maghreb.”</p>
                        <p>9. Comment: This is the first direct indication we have received here of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> willingness to be involved in
                            reaching a political solution to the Sahara conflict. While never
                            specifically stated, it was implicit in Bousselham’s remarks that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> would act as the organizer of
                            this speculated scenario and would serve as mediator in the course of
                            negotiations. However, before we recommend a <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> response to the Dept., I will want to hear what
                            Bousselham has to say when he contacts me again in a few days as he
                            promised to do (see para 5 supra).<note n="6" xml:id="d227fn6">In
                                telegram 1170 from Algiers, April 11, <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1"

                        <p>2. The Governments of Algeria and Morocco are conducting direct bilateral
                            negotiations in an effort to finally resolve the dispute regarding the
                            sovereignty of the Western Sahara. Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu
                            has offered to host these negotiations in Romania but with no active
                            role as mediator. Discussions are held directly between Algerian Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_BA_2">Abdelaziz Bouteflika</persName> and
                            one of King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s most

                            both parties. The Algerians continue to insist on a role for the
                            Polisario and question the legitimacy of Moroccan sovereignty in the
                            Western Sahara. ([<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not

                        <p>4. In late March–early April 1978, there were two meetings between
                            Moroccan and Algerian Government representatives to discuss the dispute
                            in the Western Sahara. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]
                            Morocco was represented by King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s brother, Prince Moulay Abdallah, and Algeria
                            was represented by Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BA_2"
                                >Abdelaziz Bouteflika</persName>. Both meetings should be
                            characterized as tentative and exploratory. There are no plans to hold
                            further meetings. [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>] <hi
                                rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Although the second meeting ended
                            without specific plans for another meeting, the possibility of holding
                            future meetings was not discounted.)</p>
                        <p>5. At the first meeting, the two representatives agreed that a political
                            solution must be sought to settle the Sahara dispute and that this would
                            best be accomplished by direct contact between the two governments
                            without the use of intermediaries. Morocco stated that Moroccan
                            sovereignty over the Western Sahara is not subject to negotiation or
                            discussion. At the second meeting, the Algerians, who initiated the
                            meeting, proposed accepting Moroccan sovereignty over the Western
                            Sahara. However, Algeria would force Mauritania to give up its claim to
                            that portion of the Western Sahara now within Mauritanian borders—a
                            claim the Algerians say is unjustified. The Moroccans responded that
                            this formulation surpassed the limits of a realistic solution. ([<hi

                            the SDAR. The initial meeting between Morocco and Algeria took place
                            without the knowledge of Mauritania. Mauritania has since been advised
                            by the Moroccans of the negotiations.) ([<hi rend="italic">less than 1

                            His primary objective was to insure that technical violations of the

                            1960 would be resolved so that our normal military supply relationship
                            can continue uninterrupted. The major problem had involved the
                            stationing of F–5 aircraft in the Western Sahara. King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has now assured us that the
                            F–5s will not be used in the Sahara, and we have some intelligence
                            information confirming that they have already been removed. The King did
                            say that he intended to use the F–5s in Mauritania, and he was informed
                            that this would be acceptable if both the Mauritanian and Moroccan
                            Governments were to make an official request that we permit the
                            stationing of the F–5s in Mauritanian territory. The King continues to
                            be interested in acquiring Cobra helicopters, and he was informed that
                            we would be prepared to act positively on his request. In brief, the
                            most difficult issue in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Moroccan
                            relations has been satisfactorily resolved for the moment. (S)</p>
                        <p>The King also spoke at length about the situation in the Middle East, and
                            was very doubtful that Prime Minister Begin would have the capacity to
                            show sufficient flexibility in the months ahead. He was clearly
                            concerned that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s initiative
                            might fail, thereby discrediting all moderate forces in the Arab world.
                            To protect <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s position,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> is anxious to convene
                            an Arab Summit meeting and believes that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> should not meet with Israelis anywhere on Arab
                            territory prior to such a summit. (S)</p>
                        <p>Finally, King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> and his
                            colleagues were clearly concerned by the new situation in

                            will continue. We have heard directly from Mauritanian sources, however,
                            that the new regime is very anxious to end the war, even if this means
                            ceding control over the Mauritanian sector of the Sahara. If Mauritania
                            were to take such a unilateral step, there would be strong sentiment in
                            Morocco for annexing that portion of the Sahara. For the moment, such a
                            dramatic development seems unlikely. We have some evidence that plans
                            are underway for King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> to
                            meet with President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> of
                            Algeria to try to find a political solution, but the prospects for early
                            success remain dim. (S)</p>

                            silent about the content of these exchanges, but there is little doubt
                            they are trying to facilitate a negotiated settlement to the Sahara

                                moving into a more active diplomatic role in an effort to settle the
                                Western Sahara issue. They appear to see themselves less as

                            Prospects for a diplomatic solution improved substantially following the
                            Mauritanian coup last month, when the country’s new rulers made clear
                            their intention to get out of the war, which is ravaging Mauritania’s
                            feeble economy. The Polisario’s proclamation of a ceasefire in
                            Mauritania further enhanced peace prospects.</p>
                        <p>The keystone of a negotiated settlement appears to be the establishment
                            of a Saharan political entity in that portion of the Sahara now <pb

                            Nouakchott regime is prepared to surrender this territory, and the
                            Algerians have dropped their demand that the Polisario be given the
                            opportunity to establish a Saharan state which would encompass all of
                            the former Spanish Sahara. What is unclear is the acceptability of such
                            an arrangement to the Moroccans, who have troops in the area, and
                            whether or not the Polisario would be satisfied with only this fragment
                            of the territory it claims.</p>

                        <p>1. Department believes that Moroccans and Algerians are again exploring
                            possibility of a negotiated settlement to the Sahara conflict. We
                            realize that before a settlement is in sight, or replacement aircraft
                            are available, Moroccans are unlikely to withdraw F–5s currently
                            stationed in Sahara. However, to remind King that this use of F–5s
                            creates a serious problem in Morocco’s military assistance relationship
                            with U.S., and thereby hopefully put some additional pressure on him to
                            seek a political settlement to the dispute, Ambassador is requested to
                            make following points during his farewell audience with <persName

                            the 1960 U.S.-Moroccan military assistance agreement, and the reluctance
                            of Moroccan authorities to guarantee that military equipment to be
                            purchased in the U.S. will not be employed for the defense of the
                            Sahara, the U.S. has found it necessary to suspend action on requests
                            for sales of most significant combat items.</p>

                            has been a violation of U.S.-Moroccan military assistance agreement. It
                            would be very helpful when giving this notification to be able to inform
                            the Congress that some assurance had been received from the Moroccan
                            Government regarding the eventual withdrawal of the F–5s from the
                            Sahara. If the administration cannot inform the Congress that some such
                            assurance has been received, it is possible that even more serious
                            problems could arise in our military assistance relationship.</p>

                            F–5’s from the Sahara was in terms of their eventual junking and did not

                            was clear he said, that there had been a definite misunderstanding at
                            the July 21 meeting between the King and Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName> on Moroccan use of F–5’s in
                            the part of the Sahara which Morocco claims. Noting his own presence in
                            the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> said he and
                            the King distinctly recalled that what the King had said was that the
                            F–5’s are getting old, that at some point they will be junked (mis a la
                            feraille), and that at that time they would no longer be used in the
                            Sahara. However, this did not imply a transfer from the Sahara<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d233fn5">An unknown hand underlined “this did not

                            needed there. The King, <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName>
                            said, did not and could not have given any assurances that might have
                            precluded his duty to defend Morocco as the situation required, and, in
                            any event, would have constituted a derogation from his sovereignty. The
                            King likes and respects <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>
                            and wants to make certain this misunderstanding is cleared up.<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d233fn6">An unknown hand highlighted this
                                sentence.</note> (<persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName>
                            correctly recalled that the King had become rather excited during this
                            part of the conversation.)</p>
                        <p>[3.] <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> went on to say that
                            in Morocco’s view there was no breach of the 1960 agreement. The King
                            had asked <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> to emphasize
                            this to me. The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> agreed that Morocco
                            had administrative control over the Sahara as a result of the Madrid
                            Accords and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolution for which
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> had voted. Morocco did not agree
                            with or accept the distinction between administrative control and
                            sovereignty, but leaving that question aside, there was no dispute on
                            the former. If Morocco had administrative control it must have the means
                            to maintain the security of the territory and to protect its people.
                            This means using as necessary not only F–5’s but any equipment acquired
                            from any country.</p>
                        <pb n="568" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_568"/>
                        <p>[4.] I interjected that the United States, as <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> was aware, had laws which it
                            was obliged to follow. In the case of any country which did not use
                            equipment in accord with governing agreements, Congress must be notified
                            of a violation. <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> repeated
                            that Morocco did not consider itself in violation of the 1960 agreement
                            quite aside from the question of sovereignty. He, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName>, did not understand why
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> was obliged to
                            report a violation, since there had been none.</p>
                        <p>[5.] <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> went on to say that
                            to protect itself Morocco was dependent on imported arms from France,
                            the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>, Belgium, Russia and others. The
                            only country which imposed a restriction on the use of those arms in the
                            Sahara was the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>. Even Russia imposed
                            no such restrictions despite its pro-Algerian attitude. Speaking with a
                            note of regret, <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> said
                            very carefully, “if you wish to maintain this position—which we consider
                            incorrect—then the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> will have to take
                            upon itself the responsibility for bringing the military relationship
                            between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and Morocco to an end.”
                            The King did not want to see this happen, said <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName>, but felt he had no choice and
                            had therefore asked <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> to
                            make the Moroccan position clear.</p>
                        <p>[6.] Obviously, <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> said,
                            this is a subject which the King looks forward to discussing in depth
                            with the President on his visit to the United States.</p>
                        <p>[7.] Comment: Allowing for some hyperbole and desire to shock us into a
                            more favorable attitude, we believe that the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss>’s position—unrealistic though it may be in terms of its
                            own long-term interest—reflects the immediacy and seriousness of the
                            situation in which it finds itself. The King, government and most
                            Moroccans have come to consider the Sahara conflict as a matter of
                            national survival, with casualties having increased and Polisario
                            pressure redirected exclusively on Morocco following the Mauritania
                            coup. <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> has confirmed our
                            belief that Morocco would not remove F–5’s from the Sahara. Further, it
                            is now clear that Morocco in its present mind-set of near-desperation
                            believes it cannot provide a statement of its intention to eventually
                            withdraw the F–5’s (ref State 239613),<note n="7" xml:id="d233fn7">See
                                    <ref target="#d232">Document 232</ref>.</note> and that its
                            determination to use anything necessary to defend the Sahara extends to
                            all equipment at its disposal.<note n="8" xml:id="d233fn8">An unknown
                                hand highlighted this and the previous sentence.</note> The King has
                            drawn a line which has made it difficult to see the precise modalities
                            for maintaining a satisfactory working relationship and protecting
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> long-term interests which flow
                            from Morocco’s location, pro-West orientation and moderate stance on
                            international questions. I believe that we should, nevertheless,
                            continue to seek a solid basis for our relations, and that our interests
                            are best <pb n="569" facs="0590" xml:id="pg_569"/>served by postponing a
                            direct confrontation which would rigidify the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1"
                                >GOM</gloss> position and reduce our room for maneuver. We clearly
                            should put off notification of Congress of a technical violation of the
                            1960 agreement pending the outcome of the King’s November visit. By that
                            time, the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> will have had time to
                            reflect on the fact that its arms relationship with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> remains key to its security. Moreover,
                            it is possible that Morocco-Algeria contacts may have permitted some
                            easing of Morocco’s back-to-the-wall attitude. In sum, the climate for
                            discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> on limiting
                            the use of <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> equipment in the Sahara
                            may improve and allow consideration of new ways to handle the problems
                            in our arms relationship.</p>
                        <p>[8.] More specifically, the conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> marks in our view the death
                            knell of the formula that would have permitted the use of <gloss
                                target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-origin equipment by Morocco in
                            Mauritania upon the joint request of those two countries. The most
                            satisfactory way to avoid a confrontation against our long-range
                            interests would appear to be for us to tell Congress (after the State
                            visit) that Morocco had technically violated the 1960 agreement in using
                                <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> equipment in Mauritania but had
                            withdrawn this equipment. We would further inform Congress that we have
                            entered into discussions with the <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss>
                            on our differing interpretations of the applicability of the 1960

                            accompanied by Ambassador Moulaye el Hassen and Director of Political
                            Affairs Kharchi, met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName> for one hour October 5. Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName> was also present.</p>
                        <p>2. Following opening amenities, <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1"
                                >Laghdaf</persName> said he wanted to use this opportunity to
                            explain to the Secretary the new political and economic orientation of
                            Mauritania following the recent change in government. Basically, the
                            Government of Mauritania wishes to strengthen its ties with the U.S.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> said the previous
                            government in Mauritania was not oriented toward the West and had not
                            created the best conditions to foster bilateral relations.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d234fn2">An unknown hand underlined this and the previous
                                sentence.</note> He elaborated, saying a one-party system had not
                            provided appropriate freedoms and nationalization and other economic
                            policies had not been conducive to promoting good economic relations.
                            The new government, he said, had announced the establishment of
                            democratic institutions, including a multi-party system, and declared
                            that the economy of Mauritania would be liberalized. These actions had
                            been taken because it is in keeping with national character and because
                            it is the best way to develop the country. He felt it was important for
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> to know this
                            because he was aware of the importance that the U.S. attaches to the
                            promotion of human rights everywhere in the world. He hoped that U.S.
                            investors would respond to the new conditions.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> then turned to the
                            Western Sahara problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d234fn3">An unknown hand
                                underlined “Western Sahara problem.”</note> He said he recognized
                            that the U.S. was not directly involved but was sure the U.S. would like
                            to see peace in the Sahara as well as elsewhere in the world. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> said the new government in
                            Mauritania was determined to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict
                            which pitted brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor and
                            was seeking U.S. <pb n="571" facs="0592" xml:id="pg_571"/>help in

                                target="#t_GIRM_1">GIRM</gloss>, he said, was prepared to work for
                            peace and would like the U.S. to let the full weight of its influence be
                            felt in establishing a dynamic for peace. He looked to the U.S., France
                            and Saudi Arabia to make their friendly influence felt on both Morocco
                            and Algeria.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary then asked the Foreign Minister about the current status
                            of the conflict and what form a compromise settlement might take. In
                            response <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> described the
                            recent background and lamented the fact that although Mauritania has
                            contacted both the Polisario and Morocco, there has not been much change
                            in their positions, which remain far apart.<note n="5" xml:id="d234fn5"
                                >An unknown hand underlined the words “Secretary” and “asked,” the
                                phrase “current status of the conflict and what form a compromise
                                settlement might take,” and this sentence.</note> He noted that even
                            though the Polisario has a ceasefire with Mauritania, attacks continue
                            against Mauritania in the border areas. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1"
                                >Laghdaf</persName> estimated the Polisario fighting force at about
                            5,000. He explained that despite the ceasefire, Mauritania had to keep
                            its forces mobilized and that because of the tensions, phosphate and
                            other natural resources in the region were not able to be exploited.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> conceded with a smile
                            that the second part of the Secretary’s question was much harder. There
                            are a number of factors which make for intransigence on the part of the
                            parties to the conflict, he explained. He prefaced his comments with the
                            observation that the Sahara, from a cultural and social point of view,
                            is Mauritania.<note n="6" xml:id="d234fn6">An unknown hand underlined
                                the phrase “a number of factors which make for intransigence on the
                                part of the parties to the conflict, he explained,” and this
                                sentence.</note> He continued that Morocco had made clear that it
                            would not tolerate a “mini-state” influenced by Algeria on its southern
                            border. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> felt that King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> might not be so
                            intransigent if the political entity on his southern border were of the
                            same political orientation as Morocco, that is one that is not
                            “ideologically hostile” to Morocco. Algeria, he said, does not want to
                            see Morocco expand southward and supports self-determination of the
                            Saharan people. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> guessed
                            that if the Polisario were to accept unification with Mauritania,
                            Morocco would not necessarily oppose such a move but that it would be
                            unrealistic to think that Morocco would abandon entirely its claim to
                            the Sahara. As for the Polisario, <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1"
                                >Laghdaf</persName> described it as divided into two camps. One
                            group relatively young and inexperienced, sought total independence. The
                            other group probably would not be opposed to some sort of link with
                            Mauritania. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> thought it
                            was even possible that Morocco <pb n="572" facs="0593" xml:id="pg_572"
                            />might cede a small portion of its claim by means of border
                            rectification if some sort of federation between Mauritania and Sahara
                            were effected.<note n="7" xml:id="d234fn7">An unknown hand underlined
                                this sentence and placed a checkmark in the right-hand
                                margin.</note></p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary asked if the second group would accept the proposition
                            of linkage between Mauritania and the Sahara or would it simply cede
                            part of the northern region of the Sahara and insist on autonomous
                            control of the rest. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName>
                            replied that the moderates could accept some sort of federation in areas
                            such as defense and foreign affairs but would want internal autonomy.
                            Mauritania’s first choice would be total integration but could accept a
                            federation arrangement tending toward eventual absorption. When the
                            Secretary asked what the desires of the people living in the Western
                            Sahara were, <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> said they
                            want to stay where they are but the Polisario claim the people support
                            them and want a state of their own. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1"
                                >Laghdaf</persName> said that in this respect, Mauritania, within
                            the framework of a general settlement, would not reject or oppose a free
                            expression of determination by the Saharan people.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d234fn8">In this paragraph, an unknown hand underlined the

                        <p>7. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then asked
                            where the negotiations stood at present. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1"
                                >Laghdaf</persName> stressed again that Mauritania had taken the
                            initiative to seek a peaceful solution. Algeria, he said, had accepted
                            the proposition of Mauritanian expansion to the north if the Polisario
                            agreed. However, Algeria was unalterably opposed to any southward
                            expansion by Morocco. <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName>,
                            restating an earlier point, confided that Morocco had expressed in
                            confidence that it could make some territorial concession within a
                            federation agreement between Mauritania and Polisario. He stressed the
                            extreme confidentiality of this information, saying that only President
                            Saleck and King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> know this
                            “bottom line” of their negotiating position.<note n="9" xml:id="d234fn9"

                        <p>8. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRM_1">Moose</persName>
                            asked the Foreign Minister if, in the absence of an agreement between
                            Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario and Mauritania, it is likely that the
                            Polisario will consolidate its position in the Mauritanian portion of
                            the Sahara and, if so, could Mauritania and Morocco accept such de facto
                            occupation or would Morocco act to eliminate the Polisario presence.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LCOM_1">Laghdaf</persName> quickly replied
                            that Mauritania has not and will not accept the Polisario installing
                            themselves there and denied that the Polisario has succeeded in doing
                            so. Mauritania, he said, would agree to Polisario control of the
                            Mauritanian portion <pb n="573" facs="0594" xml:id="pg_573"/>of the
                            Sahara only within the context of an overall peace settlement.<note

                            described the present situation as “provisional” and indicated that if
                            efforts to reach a peace agreement should fail, fighting would likely
                            recommence. It would weaken Morocco, he explained, if Mauritania
                            accepted the status quo as a permanent condition.</p>
                        <p>9. The Foreign Minister closed the conversation by thanking the Secretary
                            once again for taking time from his busy schedule to see him and
                            regretted placing yet another problem on his already full plate.</p>

                                D780474–1136)</note> While the King’s visit will provide an
                            opportunity to reaffirm our traditional ties with Morocco, a loyal ally
                            of the United States, both in Africa and the Middle East, it is my hope
                            that the Administration will take this occasion to reiterate its present
                            policy towards Northwest Africa in general and the Western Sahara in
                            particular.</p>
                        <p>As you know, Morocco and until recently, Mauritania, have been engaged in
                            a military conflict with guerillas of the Patriotic Front for <pb
                                n="574" facs="0595" xml:id="pg_574"/>the Liberation of Saguia el
                            Hamra and Rio de Oro. Due to Algeria’s support of the Polisario and a
                            tradition of border conflict between Morocco and Algeria, the Western
                            Sahara issue has threatened on several occasions to escalate into a more
                            general conflict between Morocco and Algeria, with serious consequences
                            for U.S. interests in both of these countries as well as in Africa and
                            the Middle East generally. While the potential for such escalation
                            continues to exist, recent diplomatic efforts have succeeded in reducing
                            the scope of the actual fighting to the northern two-thirds of the
                            contested territory.</p>
                        <p>Against this background, the Administration’s stated policy has been to
                            acknowledge Moroccan and Mauritanian administrative control but not
                            their sovereignty over that portion of the Sahara to which their
                            governments claim jurisdiction. At the same time, our country has wisely
                            supported efforts to resolve the substance of the dispute through the
                            regional mechanism of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
                        <p>This position of neutrality implies that our government continues to
                            stand by its interpretation of the 1960 bilateral defense agreement with
                            Morocco which limits the use of American weapons to the defense of the
                            Kingdom of Morocco itself, not including the Western Sahara. It is my
                            hope that the State Department will view any requests for arms or
                            military aid from Morocco in that light. In particular, I am concerned
                            about reports to the effect that Northrup Corporation is currently under
                            contract to design a $200 million underground surveillance system for
                            Morocco’s use in the Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>I also suggest that the King be encouraged to seek a peaceful resolution
                            of the continuing conflict, through the exercise of genuine
                            self-determination on the part of the Saharoui people.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> initiated this portion of
                            the conversation with invitation to Secretary to give a lawyer’s
                            distinction between administrative control and sovereignty. Secretary
                            replied that in law the two terms are defined differently. Commenting
                            that as a friend and a fellow lawyer who welcomed an exchange more frank
                            than that which might occur between heads of state, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> added that he expected there
                            would be some differences of legal opinion, as Secretary was of the
                            Anglo-Saxon school of law while he was of the Mediterranean school.</p>
                        <p>2. Continuing to respond to <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>’s original request, Secretary said administrative
                            control could be accorded without sovereignty being acquired, and he
                            cited example of U.S. trusteeship in Micronesia. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> replied that Spain was able to
                            give Morocco only the powers Spain held. Spain had not given Morocco
                            sovereignty in the Sahara because Spain did not have sovereignty.
                            Therefore sovereignty must have resided elsewhere. In fact, sovereignty
                            resided with Morocco. King then made comparison with Morocco’s
                            experience under the protectorate, when the French Resident General
                            functioned as the Sultan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. The French were
                            permitted by treaty to undertake administrative reforms but not to
                            undertake structural reforms. When Morocco signed its treaty of
                            independence with France, Morocco did not recover sovereignty, it
                            recovered administrative control.</p>
                        <p>3. Turning from the legal discussion, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> commented that there must be some sovereignty in
                            the area. The Western world had three choices: Moroccan sovereignty;
                            that of 35,000 Saharans as a first step to something else; and an
                            Algerian Marxist state. Morocco is not asking <pb n="576" facs="0597"
                                xml:id="pg_576"/>the U.S. to engage in war in the Sahara, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> continued. Eighteen million
                            Moroccans now, and forty million by 2000, will consider the Sahara
                            Moroccan. On the other side are 3,000 agitators driven by Algeria to
                            demand a republic. Stating this is not really a problem for him,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> explained that he did
                            not want his friends to appear embarrassed when they help him. When U.S.
                            diplomats speak of Morocco’s rights he would like to see them talk about
                            Morocco’s rights without questioning whether or not they exist.</p>
                        <p>4. At this point the Secretary had to leave the room to receive a
                            telephone call from the President. While he was absent, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> was informed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> had left Moscow and
                            reportedly returned to Algeria. He commented that he still thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> “finished”. When
                            the Secretary returned, he informed the King the President had asked him
                            to come immediately to the White House. It was agreed that the Secretary
                            and <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> would resume their
                            discussion of the Sahara the following day.<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3"

                        <p>1. Summary. Continued impasse on arms issue is likely to affect our
                            relations with Morocco and our military relationship in particular. We
                            should take another look at our policy on arms and particularly
                            implications of our position as it relates to self-determination in the
                            Sahara. Creation of independent Saharan state is unlikely to further our
                            interests in this area and we should stop talking about
                            self-determination if we don’t want it to happen. End summary.</p>

                        <p>2. The periodic ebb and flow in our relations with Morocco is linked
                            closely to the very subjective attitude of the Chief of State, who is
                            inclined to react according to whether he sees our actions as inimical
                            to or in support of his own positions and views. As we indicated before

                            uncertain where the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stood.
                            Indicative of his attitude was his remark to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> that all he wanted was for our
                            Ambassadors everywhere to proclaim that Morocco was our friend.<note

                            wants the Algerians to know he has it. He also wants our material
                            support, but felt that it would spoil the tone of the visit for him to
                            raise such issues. It was nevertheless clear that he hoped the visit
                            would lead to resolution of the current impasse over future arms
                            deliveries. He hoped to convince us that our interests lie with
                            unequivocal support for Morocco in the Sahara. That he did not do so
                            must have been a disappointment and an irritation, but at least he left
                            with the hope that we would be able to work out an arms formula everyone
                            could accept.</p>
                        <p>3. In the afterglow of the visit, various doors opened and the Government
                            of Morocco displayed its friendliest smiles to us. There has been no
                            outward change in the past month, but there will be as the realization
                            sinks in that we are making no progress on the arms question and that

                            it is for next year (1980), not this. While we are approaching these
                            activities with a positive spirit and believe something effective will
                            eventually emerge, the box score is not very exciting because we are
                            dealing with some pretty modest figures.</p>
                        <p>4. The progress we hope to make in the above fields is worthwhile, but it
                            will not counterbalance the growing military supply problem, which is a
                            vital question to Morocco. If we understand the implications of the
                            cable traffic correctly, we are unwilling to supply further equipment
                            the Moroccans need for use in the Sahara unless they permit an exercise
                            in self-determination there. This would seem to be consistent with the
                            PRC recommendation that we should urge <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> to be more forthcoming about carrying out <gloss

                            assurances must clearly rule out use in the Sahara, unless Moroccan
                            sovereignty is first ratified by a plebiscite or other act of free will
                            by the Sahraouis. We are also imposing the same conditions on the
                            acquisition of helicopters manufactured by the Italians.<note n="6"

                            All of this may become irrelevant because of the $60 million in <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss> arrearages the Moroccans have now
                            informed us they cannot pay, but they just may get that money from the
                            Saudis. Meanwhile, to add to local unhappiness we have told the
                            Moroccans that just in case they should ask us (which they haven’t yet)
                            to take their troops home from Shaba, we won’t do it.</p>
                        <p>5. Although we assume there has been no change in our position vis-a-vis
                            Morocco, the impression created in Moroccan minds by our statement to
                            Benjelloun on the above matters is likely to be that we have toughened
                            our stance.<note n="7" xml:id="d237fn7">See <ref target="#d166">Document

                            gotten so tough so quickly, and may deduce that the young men in the
                            Department repeatedly conjured up by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName> have triumphed over the
                            sound instincts of his good friends the Secretary and the President, and
                            that they are busily undermining the structure so carefully put together
                            during the visit. With <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>
                            reportedly under criticism from his local detractors for the low level
                            of U.S. press coverage of the King’s visit, he will likely redouble his
                            efforts to push his conspiracy thesis.</p>
                        <p>6. I have several observations. The first is that a policy of support for
                            self-determination in the Sahara is in accord with our principles and
                            makes a good deal of sense in terms of our relations with the African
                            states. It does not make much sense, however, with the Arab states, most
                            of whom have already approved the Moroccan acquisition of the territory
                            in question as being an expression of Arab unity and fulfillment of a
                            historical claim, and who recall that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> appeared to bless such action at the 1974
                            Arab Summit in Rabat.<note n="8" xml:id="d237fn8">See <ref
                                    target="#d223fn2">footnote 2, Document 223</ref>.</note> They
                            realize that were it not for Algeria, the Polisario would never have
                            gotten off the ground and the Moroccan action would have gone unopposed.
                            They attribute crass, geopolitical motives to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> and are not particularly
                            interested in the Polisario.</p>
                        <pb n="579" facs="0600" xml:id="pg_579"/>
                        <p>7. Assuming, however, that for non-Arab reasons we want to see
                            self-determination in the Sahara, it is logical for us to withhold arms
                            and to attempt to exert pressure on <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> in the direction of a plebiscite or other action
                            designed to give the Saharans a voice in their future. (One would like
                            to find similar means to support self-determination across the board,
                            say for the Armenians and the Biafrans, but the principle is easier to
                            apply some places than it is others. That need not detract from its
                            validity, but it makes for cynical reactions when we do not apply it
                            universally.)</p>
                        <p>8. The second observation is that we should be in no doubt that in the
                            unlikely event of a free vote in the Sahara, the Saharans would opt for
                            independence. They do not want to be part of Morocco. They want to have
                            their own ministate and become Cabinet ministers, relying on the
                            international community and their phosphates to keep them in Mercedeses.
                            There are worse things that could happen, and in human rights terms,
                            narrowly defined, there is much to say for such a state. It would be a
                            focus of weakness, however, and it would not make great sense if we are
                            interested in area stability. In utilitarian terms of the greatest good
                            for the greatest number it will be hard to defend. Perhaps we do not
                            care all that much, but I rather think we do.</p>
                        <p>9. The emergence of an independent Saharan state in the area controlled
                            by Morocco cannot be brought about without upsetting the internal
                            political order in this state. <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> cannot give up the Sahara. He will be finished if
                            he does, and we will go the way of Abdel Aziz, whose empire was
                            partitioned by the French and Spanish.</p>
                        <p>10. In brief, if we really mean what we say about self-determination, and
                            we are intent on pressuring the Moroccans in that direction, we should
                            be aware of the shoals ahead. In the unlikely event such pressures
                            succeeded, we could face a foreign policy disaster with the creation of
                            a mini-state on the Saharan coast. If they do not succeed, we will still
                            incur the resentment of the Moroccans, which could seriously harm our
                            interests in this area.</p>
                        <p>11. If, on the other hand, we don’t really mean it, we should stop
                            talking about it. As seen from here, the only realistic solution is some
                            sort of negotiated settlement between the Algerians, Mauritanians and
                            the Moroccans, from which the Saharans might emerge with a piece of
                            Mauritania, but which would not affect the Moroccan hold over their
                            portion of the Sahara. Perhaps one could say that a nod would then have
                            been given in the direction of self-determination, but it would be an
                            essentially cynical settlement between the three powers and the
                            Polisario. There would be no meaningful act of self-determination in the
                            area controlled by Morocco. If, however, this is what we want to see
                            happen, we should consider how we are going to help bring it about, and
                            whether we are prepared to take a more active role in <pb n="580"
                                facs="0601" xml:id="pg_580"/>promoting it. In any event, a change in
                            rhetoric could seem to be in order, i.e., we should start talking about
                            accommodation rather than self-determination.</p>
                        <p>12. My third observation is that if we maintain our current position on
                            self-determination, it will affect our military relationship with
                            Morocco. There is undoubtedly a good deal of linkage in <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s mind between what we want
                            from him and what we have done for him lately. He is grateful for our
                            recent votes in the United Nations,<note n="9" xml:id="d237fn9">See <ref
                                    target="#d166fn5">footnote 5, Document 166</ref>.</note> for the
                            warmth of his welcome in Washington and for our expressed intent to be
                            helpful in various fields, but he weighs them against the military
                            questions and the fact that we are unwilling to sell him arms he needs
                            for the Sahara, which is an obsession locally today. When he is in such
                            a frame of mind, he is unlikely to be helpful to us on such matters as
                            GEODSS. He will drag his feet, people will not answer telephones, and we
                            will experience a good deal of frustration. He could always surprise us,
                            of course, and decide it is in his interest to entangle us further in a
                            web of relationships he can eventually use to draw us along, but he may
                            also choose just to keep us dangling and to extract a quid pro quo
                            before we are able even to start the project.</p>
                        <p>13. I realize that the adversary process on which our government is based
                            normally leads to fuzzy lowest common denominator solutions, and that
                            either-or propositions are inherently noxious to Washington. I would
                            respectfully suggest, however, that we have two broad choices today; we
                            can continue to withhold arms in the absence of assurances that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> will find it very
                            difficult to give and even more difficult to honor, and we can continue
                            to speak about, and by implication press for, self-determination. This
                            policy is viable, but it has consequences for our much valued military
                            relationship. We could also withhold arms but stop talking about
                            self-determination. Alternatively, we can reexamine the legal decision
                            which has put us in our current bind and accept the argument that
                            Morocco, like Israel in Sinai, has certain rights and obligations as an
                            occupying power and that these include defense of the territory in
                            question. Use of <gloss target="#t_FMS_1">FMS</gloss>-supplied equipment
                            in the Sahara would therefore not be in violation of the 1960 agreement.
                            This would have certain consequences in our relations with Algeria which
                            I am at this point unable to assess, but it would not be inconsistent
                            with efforts to promote a negotiated settlement between the Moroccans
                            and Algerians, the latter presumably being less ready to talk if they
                            think the Moroccans are losing.</p>
                        <p>[14.] It seems to me that our first step in taking a decision should be
                            to consider thoroughly what we want to see occurring in this part <pb
                                n="581" facs="0602" xml:id="pg_581"/>of North Africa and how we can
                            envisage developments here impacting on the security of the region and
                            our interests. I realize that we went through an intensive policy review
                            last spring,<note n="10" xml:id="d237fn10">See <ref target="#d30"

                            seems particularly timely, now that <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"

                            but there is an apparent contradiction between what we are doing and
                            what we expect to happen on the ground.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: I heartily concur with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName>’s suggestion that the United
                            States reexamine its policy in Morocco and, by <pb n="582" facs="0603"
                                xml:id="pg_582"/>implication, North Africa. From here, however, the
                            creation of some sort of Saharan state seems just a matter of time
                            whatever action we choose to take or not take. I feel, therefore, that
                            the United States should prepare itself in light of recent events in the
                            area for the changes that are likely to occur in the upcoming months.
                            Such a newly considered policy should enable us to be ready for what
                            happens and not taken by surprise. End summary.</p>
                        <p>2. I want to endorse strongly the thrust and conclusion of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName>’s refreshing cable
                            (ref. A). As addressees are aware, I have felt for some time that the
                            time is ripe for a North African policy review and for analyzing and
                            identifying specifically U.S. interests in the region and the
                            conflicting claims on us which the nations in the region have.</p>
                        <p>3. As ref C tries to make clear, there are no current U.S. bilateral
                            policies with either Algeria or Morocco which greatly disrupt our
                            bilateral goals and [garble—objectives with] the other. In this light, I
                            would like to examine the Western Saharan question as it is seen from
                            Algiers.</p>
                        <p>4. Mauritania wants out of the Western Saharan fray. This has been
                            reported by well-informed observers (refs. D and E). The <gloss
                                target="#t_GIRM_1">GIRM</gloss> graphically displayed its desire for
                            improved Algerian-Mauritanian relations by sending its Foreign Minister
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s
                            funeral. Ould Saleck’s New Year’s message (ref. D) further demonstrated
                            this policy. The big question seems to be not whether Mauritania will
                            opt out of the Western Saharan conflict, but when and how, and what will
                            be Morocco’s reaction.</p>
                        <p>5. Polisario is alive and relatively well. <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                                >Boumediene</persName> did not create it, although he certainly
                            helped it create a national conscience in the Sahara. In spite of the
                            lack of widespread popular Algerian support for the organization and its
                            cause, the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> continues to back
                            Polisario strongly (see para 7 below). If this Algerian support were to
                            dwindle or even disappear, most observers believe that Polisario now has
                            enough cohesion, moral and political consciousness, and military
                            equipment to continue to harass Moroccan (and if necessary, Mauritanian)
                            forces in the Western Sahara.</p>
                        <p>6. According to non-official American and other Western observers who
                            have recently visited the Moroccan-controlled portion of the Western
                            Sahara and Saharan refugee camps near Tindouf, at least among some of
                            the more articulate Saharans, there is considerable feeling against
                            Moroccan and Mauritanian domination. Para 8, ref A confirms this
                            feeling. As the conflict continues and strong Moroccan military activity
                            becomes necessarily repressive, these antagonistic Saharan feelings are
                            likely to deepen, thereby enhancing Saharan nationalism.</p>
                        <p>7. Contrary to earlier beliefs that Algerian support for Polisario would
                            diminish after <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName>’s
                            [garble—death there] is every indication that this will not be the case.
                            Interim Chief of State Bitat made <pb n="583" facs="0604"
                                xml:id="pg_583"/>a big issue of continued <gloss target="#t_GOA_1"
                                >GOA</gloss> backing for Polisario when he opened the National Youth
                            Congress January 6 and the Polisario observer to the Congress was given
                            special attention. Indeed, it would be unwise to believe that Algeria
                            would give its Moroccan rival a break in the Western Sahara at this
                            time. All arguments run counter to such a concilliatory move. The
                                post-<persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> regime must
                            demonstrate its revolutionary credential. The <gloss target="#t_GOA_1"
                                >GOA</gloss> views the U.S. vote on the Sahara as a demonstration of
                            international support for its Saharan policy. Even if it does not go
                            very deep, there is some intellectual and philosophical support for
                            Polisario as a liberation movement among Algerians. For those Algerians
                            who cherish their revolutionary history and credentials, and especially
                            for the present government, it would be very difficult to abandon
                            Algerian support of Polisario. Mauritania seems to be leaning Algeria’s
                            way and Polisario forces are not being defeated in the field. Morale in
                            the refugee camps, as reported by private U.S. and other Western
                            observers, is good.</p>
                        <p>8. Morocco, on the other hand, seems to be painting itself into a corner.
                            It is true that there appears to be genuine, widespread support for King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s Saharan policy in
                            Morocco. However, <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> is in a
                            weak position in the Sahara given Morocco’s increasing isolation, the
                            strength of the Saharan opposition and his internal headaches (a
                            sluggish economy, deeply seated social inequalities and, in the possible
                            future, an army that is tired of fighting a losing battle).</p>
                        <p>9. In light of the foregoing, there are policy implications which the
                            United States has not faced squarely:</p>
                        <p>A) The United States cannot afford to ignore reality:</p>
                        <p>1) Given the apparent Polisario strength and continued <gloss
                                target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> support, the Saharan conflict is not
                            going to wither and die. On the contrary, it is most likely to continue
                            at its present level.</p>
                        <p>2) We understand that the southern or Mauritanian-administered portion of
                            the Western Sahara is already controlled by Polisario to a great
                            extent.</p>
                        <p>3) The Saharans do not want to be part of Morocco (para 8, ref. A).</p>
                        <p>B) A Saharan mini-state is probably imminent:</p>
                        <p>1) Given the above realities, it is likely that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GIRM_1">GIRM</gloss> will sue for peace with Polisario
                            soon. Polisario leaders, such as Omar Hadrami, member of the Executive
                            Committee and Revolutionary Council (talking to non-official American
                            visitors in Algiers recently), have repeatedly stated that Polisario
                            will reject any offer of territorial sovereignty which does not include
                            both parts of the former Spanish Sahara. Hadrami reportedly said that if
                            Algeria, Mauritania and Morocco agreed to a solution which gives
                            Polisario only the Mauritanian section of the Sahara, Polisario “would
                            go it alone until the final victory.” In <pb n="584" facs="0605"
                                xml:id="pg_584"/>spite of such avowals, however, it is quite
                            possible that Polisario would accept less than the whole loaf, i.e., the
                            Mauritanian-administered area.</p>
                        <p>2) If such a mini-state is created, whether or not the United States
                            likes it, it can (or should) do nothing to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>3) No-one knows what sort of ideology a Polisario-led Western Saharan
                            state would follow. Probably, but not necessarily, it would lean heavily
                            on the <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss> and Algerian rhetoric. On
                            the other hand, Polisario leaders have repeatedly told journalists and
                            scholars that the Front has no ideology except to win independence.
                            Whether completely true or not, this acknowledgement that Polisario has
                            not chosen sides can be used by Western nations, including the United
                            States, to develop positive relations with a new Western Saharan state.
                            Comment: On the other hand, lack of official American contact with
                            Polisario ties our hands and prevents us from developing the
                            relationships which will be vital if the Western Sahara becomes
                            independent. End comment. One must add that there is a great risk of
                            misunderstanding the Sahara crisis, if we try to force it into the
                            East-West ideological context with which we have grown accustomed to
                            dealing.</p>
                        <p>D) At this late date, the United States cannot retreat from its public
                            position supporting self-determination in the Western Sahara. It is our
                            position, for good or ill, and we are stuck with it. To change it would
                            win few friends and disappoint many, especially African, states. For
                            years, we have used the self-determination slogan to mollify the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>. To discard it now would be to risk
                            considerable alienation in African circles. What’s more,
                            self-determination has become an irreversible process in the last half
                            of the twentieth century.</p>
                        <p>E) Morocco and King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> need
                            the United States at least as much as we need them. While the King has
                            often aligned his policies with ours, he has acted primarily out of his
                            own interest, not that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>10. In light of the above, accommodation (para 11, ref. A) may offer the
                            United States a way out of the present dilemma. A third option (in
                            addition to the two mentioned in paras 13 and 14, ref. A and drawing
                            from para 11, ref. A) is a trilateral agreement with Polisario to give
                            it “a piece of Mauritania.” In spite of Polisario’s protestations (see
                            para 9 B) 1) above), such a compromise would probably be accepted,
                            however reluctantly, and seems the most likely from where we sit. Such
                            an option raises further problems, of course (the probability that such
                            a state will be a staging area for attacks into Moroccan-administered
                            Sahara, and its viability), which would have to be carefully
                            examined.</p>
                        <p>11. Finally, I wish to reiterate my total agreement with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PRB_1">Parker</persName>’s call for a policy
                            review. North Africa is a region in ferment. I want to see the United
                            States ready for those changes, not, as too often happens, simply
                            reacting to events. We have been asked by the <pb n="585" facs="0606"
                                xml:id="pg_585"/>President and the Secretary to develop a more
                            creative and imaginative foreign policy. Therefore, let’s try to
                            anticipate and influence future events, not just on the sidelines as a
                            situation falls to pieces. Current experience shows us how difficult it
                            is to put the pieces together again.<note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4"

                                and recognize that there have been other recent developments which
                                have serious implications for Morocco and the region. All of us must
                                do our best to ensure that these developments will not lead to
                                further widening of the conflict. In this regard, I am uneasy about
                                the possible repercussions of the reported new Moroccan moves in the
                                Tiris al-Gharbia.”</note></p>

                            handwringing text: (C)</p>
                        <p>—It is not even-handed (why a letter to Morocco and not one to
                            Algeria?);</p>
                        <p>—There is no carrot and precious little stick (<persName

                            President’s “sympathy” at this point; he wants material support);</p>
                        <p>—The pious tone of this message, far from encouraging Hassanian second
                            thoughts, will merely incense him and promote a siege mentality. (C)</p>
                        <p>In short, since such a message can do no good—and could well add another

                                control.<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">See <ref target="#d242"

                        <p>I believe that it is important to get a fundamental assessment of where
                            developments are heading in Northwest Africa and our policy options.
                            State is, and always has been, strongly pro-Algerian. Morocco has been a
                            good strong friend, but the strength of that regime can be questioned.
                            The war in the Sahara drags on and the Polisario appear to be gaining
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, I believe we should take the time to have a PRM. It
                            should be accompanied by a serious intelligence assessment of the trends
                            in Northwest Africa—political, military and economic. Unlike past PRM’s,
                            it should be prepared on a close-hold basis.</p>
                        <p>I believe this is far preferable to rushing ahead with an <hi
                                rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> decision on Moroccan arms policy. We are
                            under no time pressure from the Moroccans. We have several months in
                            which to make a deliberate, careful decision.</p>

                        <p>—State has finally reached the point, prefigured in a number of VBB
                            discussions, where <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> can
                            submit an options paper to the President (in fact, <persName

                                >Saunders</persName> testily noted, it was the unrelenting pressure
                            from us which accelerated this process, which we now seem inclined to
                            protract with a PRM.</p>
                        <p>—More important, it is <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1">Saunders</persName>
                            view—which <persName corresp="#p_SG_1">Gary Sick</persName> and I
                            share—that the options for discussion are already based on all relevant
                            inputs from the intelligence community, Defense, and other agencies <pb

                            the region as a whole (as they did at the time of our last PRC in late

                        <p>In my view there is really only one issue we need to address, and one
                            that has not changed since I first took up North Africa in the NSC three
                            months ago (it predates that experience by at least two years, as I can
                            attest by service in the area myself): do we or do we not decide to help
                            the Moroccans in ways that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> perceive as
                            helpful? For better or for worse, the OV–10 has become a litmus test of
                            our reliability and further defines the question: do we or do we not
                            provide that specific assistance in a situation where the bureaucracies
                            are in basic agreement on only one thing, to wit, our relationship with
                            a trusted, traditional, and strategically important friend continues to
                            deteriorate? (C)</p>
                        <p>There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one area where I think we do need better
                            intelligence (which I am trying to acquire through Madeleine) and that
                            concerns the Hill: to what extent would a liberalized arms supply
                            decision draw significant Congressional flak? State is mesmerized by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1">Solarz</persName>, sees him as a
                            formidable opponent who must be accommodated. I question this, as do
                            others outside State: Wouldn’t the strong pro-Moroccan stands of Javits
                            and Stone offset any downside <persName corresp="#p_SSJ_1"
                                >Solarz</persName> would introduce? More important, are we now
                            willing to defer the function of formulating foreign policy to one
                            Member of Congress, however influential he may be? (C)</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we need to decide whether to go through with the PRC
                            originally envisaged (UNGA engagements will complicate the near-term
                            scheduling). <persName corresp="#p_SG_1">Gary Sick</persName> and I
                            strongly favor the PRC route now, leaving open the possibility of a PRM
                            should the meeting not produce a satisfactory outcome. And by outcome I
                            mean a decision which, after stewing over this subject lo these many
                            months, would clearly not be “ad hoc.” (C)</p>

                            <salute>Dear Mr. Secretary:</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I would like to offer you some comments and thoughts on how U.S. policy
                            might help move the situation in the Western Sahara toward a peaceful
                            solution. I appreciate the way in which the State Department has
                            consulted with Congress on this issue and I trust you will find our
                            input helpful.</p>
                        <p>Recent information from press reports and our intelligence community
                            indicate to me that the situation in the Western Sahara is evolving:</p>
                        <p>—Mauritania has signed a peace agreement with the Polisario and several
                            thousand Moroccan troops have apparently been withdrawn from
                            Mauritania;</p>
                        <p>—The war is not a stalemate, it is not now going in Morocco’s favor;</p>
                        <p>—Morocco is now using a defensive “garrison” strategy, the offensive “hot
                            pursuit” strategy appears to have failed;</p>
                        <p>—The costs to Morocco of the war are increasing financially and
                            politically and in terms of losses of military equipment and men;</p>
                        <p>—Middle and low-level military seem to want out of the war;</p>
                        <p>—What started as a popular movement for Moroccans and the King in late
                            1975 has now turned into a risky venture in which many, including
                            perhaps the King himself, perceive the monarchy to be in trouble, and
                            under attack;</p>
                        <p>—King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> has been angered by
                            American refusal of arms for the Sahara war but at the same time he
                            seems to appreciate the fact that U.S. arms cannot turn the war around
                            in his favor;</p>
                        <p>—The U.S. has not had close or frank relations with the King
                            [illegible].</p>
                        <p>—Polisario attacks into southern Morocco have shaken an awareness of the
                            war into the Moroccan people and changed their attitude toward accepting
                            a settlement.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion that I draw from this information is that the war is now a
                            grave political liability for King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> and U.S. policy, while it should be supportive of
                            the King personally, should not be supportive of his efforts in the
                            Sahara. We need the confidence of the King to persuade him to modify a
                            disastrous policy.</p>
                        <pb n="594" facs="0615" xml:id="pg_594"/>
                        <p>It is part of my assessment of the situations in Iran and Nicaragua,
                            situations which eroded so quickly, that we failed to deal firmly and
                            frankly with long time friends: we were often prisoners of their whims

                            on the Western Sahara certainly should be taken as an encouraging sign
                            and we should follow up on it with an active, positive policy posture

                            its conflict in the Western Sahara and thereby free to play a more
                            active role in the peace process;</p>

                        <p>—reassurance to African states and Middle East states that the United

                            and that the United States is willing to make a great effort to play
                            this facilitating role.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, I would suggest a policy strategy composed of the following
                            elements:</p>
                        <p>A. Publicly reject the sale of equipment such as the OV–10 and state why
                            we will not sell it. We should follow a policy of modest arms sales for
                            Morocco. Our immediate goals in our arms sales policies should be
                            three-fold: 1.) be partially responsive to the King’s need for defensive
                            equipment for Morocco; 2.) disassociate ourselves from his Saharan
                            policies in strong terms but leave us with the ability to try to
                            influence him privately; and 3.) seek to build a new confidence
                            relationship with the King to enable us to help him out of his
                            disastrous course in the Western Sahara;</p>
                        <p>B. Convince Morocco that self-determination of the Saharan people has not
                            occurred but will have to occur if a settlement is to be reached.
                            Support and explore all possible ways of achieving a settlement which
                            guarantees self-determination for the Western Sahara but also allows
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> to save face in
                            accepting it. Additional measures should be taken to try to involve
                            third parties, particularly Spain, which have some responsibility for
                            the existing problem and give them the support required to play a
                            constructive role. The efforts that have been made so far are inadequate
                            to exclude this as a possibility;</p>
                        <p>C. Seize this problem as an opportunity to work more closely with the new
                            leadership in Algeria, establish new rapport and set our relations on a
                            positive footing for the future. While we should not expect Algeria to
                            be able to deliver Polisario agreement in a settlement Algeria can and
                            should be involved in a positive way with encouragement from us;</p>
                        <p>D. Don’t ignore Mauritania. The new leadership there has chosen a
                            difficult course in terms of its relations with Morocco by signing a
                            peace agreement with the Polisario. The government has little leverage
                            in the present situation. While not seeking to anger Morocco more, there
                            must be some concrete things we could do to show some support to
                            Mauritania;</p>
                        <p>E. Deal with the Polisario directly and involve them in any settlement
                            plans or preparations from the outset. At a minimum our contacts and
                            communications with the Polisario directly and through third
                            parties,—France, Spain, U.N.,—should be sustained and more accurate;</p>
                        <p>F. Give new priority to the problem by assigning a special ambassador and
                            team to work on the issue and as soon as possible designate a new
                            ambassador for Morocco.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s Saharan dilemma has
                            reached a critical phase. Any encouragement we give him to pursue the
                            war against the Polisario could spell disaster for him and for our
                            policy in the region.</p>
                        <p>I hope these suggestions and thoughts will be useful in your policy
                            planning. Please keep me informed of developments in the Western Sahara
                            and of any new developments in our policy.</p>

                        <p>The State Department, as you are undoubtedly aware, is currently

                            conclusions.</p>
                        <p>My basic recommendations are these:</p>
                        <p>1) We should continue our current policy of providing Morocco with arms
                            for its own defense but not with arms specifically suitable for use in
                            the Western Sahara;</p>
                        <pb n="597" facs="0618" xml:id="pg_597"/>
                        <p>2) We should quietly encourage efforts by friendly intermediaries, such
                            as Spain, Saudi Arabia, Liberia and France, to bring the parties to the
                            conflict together in order to encourage a peaceful settlement and help
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> extricate himself
                            from a conflict he cannot win militarily and which, if it continues, may
                            well undermine him politically; and</p>
                        <p>3) We should simultaneously remove the existing prohibitions on contact
                            between our diplomats and Polisario officials and on visits by our
                            diplomatic personnel to the Moroccan-held areas of the Western
                                Sahara.<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4">In telegram 46369 to Rabat,
                                February 24, the Department transmitted guidelines for contact with
                                Polisario representatives at post. (Carter Library, National

                        <p>I believe it would be a fundamental contradiction of the principles on
                            which our country was founded if we were to assist in the suppression of
                            a genuinely indigenous and internationally recognized effort to achieve
                            self-determination, in the absence of any compelling strategic and
                            political considerations to the contrary. In the case of the Western
                            Sahara, I believe that the provision of arms to Morocco to combat the
                            Polisario would be compatible with neither our ideals nor our
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>When I began my visit to the region, Mr. President, I leaned toward the
                            view that there might well be a convincing strategic and political case
                            for changing our arms sales policy. But I came away from my trip
                            persuaded that the sale of arms to Morocco for use in the Sahara would
                            have significant negative consequences for U.S. foreign policy and that
                            the advantages cited in behalf of such a course of action are either
                            minimal or non-existent.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, I’m convinced on the basis of detailed and exclusive
                            conversations with the leaders of the Polisario as well as the
                            observations of knowledgeable journalists and diplomats that this is an
                            authentic national liberation movement which has managed to create a
                            national as opposed to a purely tribal sense of political consciousness,
                            and that it is likely to play a major role in the political future of
                            the region. An independent Saharan entity would have a probable
                            population of over 100,000 and a substantial resource base. Furthermore,
                            of all the liberation movements in the world, there is none I can think
                            of that is seemingly less hostile to and potentially more friendly
                            towards the West than the Polisario. Based on my conversations with the
                            Polisario leadership, it is clear that they are neither pro-Marxist nor
                            pro-Soviet. Indeed, the leadership has specifically refrained from
                            asking the Soviets for military support because it does not want to
                            internationalize the conflict. And it has indicated that in the context
                            of <pb n="598" facs="0619" xml:id="pg_598"/>an independent Saharan state
                            it would be inclined, for economic and geopolitical reasons, to look to
                            the West, not the East, for support. Consequently, while we may not have
                            any real interest in facilitating the establishment of some kind of
                            Saharan homeland in the Western Sahara, it seems to me we clearly do not
                            have any significant interest in preventing it.</p>
                        <p>Second, while Morocco would clearly like to purchase counter-insurgency
                            weaponry from us, I am persuaded after my conversations with both
                            Moroccan officials and U.S. diplomats in Rabat that a continued refusal
                            on our part to provide this equipment would not occasion a serious break
                            in our relationship, although it would undoubtedly be a [illegible] of
                            continued irritation. In fact, the state of U.S.-Moroccan relations is
                            much better than I was led to believe before I made the trip, partly
                            because of U.S. cooperation in the Shaba airlift, the recent
                            Congressional decision to increase U.S. military aid by 50%, the sale of
                            spare parts for the F5s, and the Administration’s approval of the sale
                            of U.S.-licensed Chinook helicopters to Morocco by Italy.<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d246fn5">See <ref target="#d167">Document 167</ref> and <ref
                                    target="#d167fn6">footnote 6</ref> thereto.</note> In fact,
                            Moroccan leaders seem much more interested in our diplomatic
                            understanding than in the arms sales issue per se. We also have to ask
                            what an improvement in Moroccan-American relations would actually
                            produce. If the sale of arms to Morocco for use in the Sahara would lead
                            the Moroccans to resume diplomatic relations with Egypt, endorse the
                            Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and effectively support the Camp David
                            process—thereby providing President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                                >Sadat</persName> with additional backing in the Arab world—it would
                            be possible to make a very persuasive case for some change in our arms
                            sales policy. But to the extent that the King has decided to sever
                            relations with Egypt and refrain from supporting the Camp David process
                            because he clearly believes that the opposite course would be
                            incompatible with his own political interests, it is exceedingly
                            unlikely that a change in our arms sales policy would produce a reversal
                            of his present position.</p>
                        <p>Third, a change in policy would undoubtedly bring to a halt the
                            improvement that has taken place in our economic and political
                            relationship with Algeria, which is Polisario’s major external
                            supporter. In recent years Algeria has become a much more important
                            economic partner of the U.S. than Morocco. Thus Algeria provides 9% of
                            our crude oil imports (16% of East Coast imports); U.S. firms have won
                            over $6 billion in construction contracts since the early 1970s; and
                            Export-Import bank exposure is now at the $1.4 billion mark. Algeria has
                            also begun to take more moderate positions on a number of international
                            issues which are consistent with our own policy objectives. The <pb
                                n="599" facs="0620" xml:id="pg_599"/>Algerians have worked with
                            Yugoslavia to try to prevent Cuba from moving the Non-Aligned Conference
                            toward a directly pro-Soviet position, worked for a peaceful resolution
                            of the conflict between the two Yemens, and opposed Soviet and Cuban
                            policy in Cambodia, Ethiopia and Uganda. Furthermore, the election of
                            President Chadli Benjedid, who unlike former President Boumedienne is
                            more of a pragmatist than an ideologue, has created new opportunities
                            for improvement in our bilateral relations. There is reason to believe
                            that, if and when President Benjedid consolidates his power, the stage
                            will be set for further progress in the relations between our two
                            countries. But such an improvement will probably become impossible if,
                            in the interim, we eliminate the restrictions on the sale of arms to
                            Morocco which are suitable for use in the Sahara. I thought you would be
                            interested in knowing that as my meeting with Benjedid concluded and he
                            escorted me to the door, he indicated that he was very much looking
                            forward to his forthcoming visit to Washington next year, although he
                            indicated that he would not be able to come if in the interim we
                            abandoned our policy of neutrality on the conflict in the Western
                            Sahara.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, a change in our arms sales policy would have adverse consequences
                            for our relations with a number of important African and Third World
                            countries. At its Monrovia summit this July, the Organization of African
                            Unity voted overwhelmingly to approve the recommendations of five
                            African Presidents (Nimeiri of Sudan, Obasanjo of Nigeria, Traoré of
                            Mali, Touré of Guinea and Nyerere of Tanzania) for a cease fire and
                            internationally supervised referendum in order to achieve
                            self-determination in the Western Sahara.<note n="6" xml:id="d246fn6"
                                >See <ref target="#d45fn4">footnote 4, Document 45</ref>.</note>
                            This represented a clear evolution in the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss>’s position on the conflict, and I was particularly
                            impressed by <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Chairman and Liberian
                            President Tolbert’s advice, when I was in Liberia last month, that the
                            vote indicated “a clear consensus in Africa for an independent Saharan
                            state” and “Africa would look with much disfavor” upon a change in our
                            arms sales policy.<note n="7" xml:id="d246fn7">In telegram 6173 from

                            to take equally strong positions. In the aftermath of the <gloss
                                target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> vote, Morocco’s diplomatic position
                            has been greatly weakened and we will probably see growing support for
                            the Polisario position at the United Nations, in other world forums, and
                            in acts of individual diplomatic recognition. While few states are
                            likely to permit bilateral relations with the U.S. to suffer due to this
                            issue alone, a change in our policy will probably contribute to
                            cumulative downturns where there are also <pb n="600" facs="0621"
                                xml:id="pg_600"/>other matters of concern. It would also deeply
                            disappoint many of our African friends who have appreciated the
                            determination of your Administration to view African problems in an
                            African context and who would see such a change in policy as an implicit
                            repudiation of the new direction in which you have moved our African
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Fifth, Morocco’s international isolation has been accentuated by its
                            recent de facto annexation of the Mauritanian-administered portion of
                            the Western Sahara. A U.S. decision to provide Morocco with arms for use
                            in the Sahara at this time would appear, both at home and abroad, as a
                            reward for aggression. I understand that the Department has been
                            preparing a new legal interpretation of our military agreement with
                            Morocco that would recognize Morocco’s “lawful administrative authority”
                            in its sector of the Sahara and thereby enable us to provide arms that
                            could be used in that sector to defend Southern Morocco.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d246fn8">Not found.</note> But this would not justify their
                            inevitable use in the formerly Mauritanian sector to defend a clearly
                            illegitimate act of territorial annexation.</p>
                        <p>Sixth, by removing restrictions on arms sales to Morocco we would run the
                            risk of internationalizing what has so far been a localized crisis.
                            Until now, Polisario has refrained from requesting Soviet military
                            assistance. If we change our policy, the Soviets could see an
                            opportunity to gain an advantage, particularly in view of Polisario’s
                            widespread diplomatic support, and begin to become involved in a
                            conflict from which they have so far abstained.</p>
                        <p>Seventh, some people have argued that a change in policy would increase
                            our influence with Morocco and put us in a better position to urge
                            Morocco to negotiate a resolution of the conflict. In reality, I believe
                            it would be likely to have the opposite effect. During the course of my
                            conversation with the King, he made it clear that he looked to U.S. arms
                            for the Sahara as a means for producing a quick Moroccan victory. To the
                            extent that both the King and his chief military advisers believe that a
                            military victory is possible—in spite of the opinion of knowledgable
                            military observers that such a victory is impossible—our selling Morocco
                            arms suitable for use in the Sahara would not encourage Morocco to make
                            the concessions necessary for a diplomatic solution. I also suspect that
                            such a change in policy would result in a hardening of the Algerian
                            position, and to the extent that Algerian cooperation is necessary for a
                            peaceful resolution of the problem, would reduce the chances for a
                            negotiated settlement. Since our major interest in the Sahara is in
                            ending the war rather than in facilitating any particular outcome of the
                            war, and since the only way to end the war is by political rather than
                            military means, I think it would be a serious <pb n="601" facs="0622"
                                xml:id="pg_601"/>mistake to initiate a change in policy that would
                            make meaningful negotiations more difficult to achieve.</p>
                        <p>Eighth, some have suggested that a change in our arms sales policy would
                            be seen by other countries as a manifestation of our willingness to help
                            a friend in need. While there are some countries such as Saudi Arabia
                            and Egypt which would clearly be pleased by such a development, I do not
                            believe they view our arms sales policy toward Morocco as a litmus test
                            of our determination to come to the aid of friendly countries. To the
                            extent that we provide Morocco with arms for its own self-defense, but
                            not for use in the Sahara, we can maintain that we are willing to help
                            our friends, although not by providing assistance in a war of dubious
                            legitimacy which has attracted virtually no international support. Also,
                            if we changed our arms sales policy, other friends of the U.S. with
                            interests in the region would be very displeased, particularly Spain,
                            Liberia and Nigeria. Still other friends, such as Kuwait, North Yemen,
                            Tunisia and Jordan, are not particularly concerned with this issue and
                            could easily accept a continuation of our previous policy.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, it seems to me that from the moment the State Department began to
                            actively consider the sale of arms to Morocco for use in the Sahara, all
                            the subsequent developments in the region have militated in favor of a
                            continuation of our present policy: the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> has voted overwhelmingly in favor of self-determination
                            for the people of the Western Sahara; the Non-Aligned Conference has
                            strongly supported the new <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>
                            position; Morocco has annexed the Mauritanian-administered section of
                            the Sahara and been denounced by its former partner as an aggressor; and
                            both President Tolbert and Tunisian President <persName
                                corresp="#p_BH_2">Bourguiba</persName> have called for regional
                            peace conferences to deal with the conflict. Also, if the purpose of a
                            change in arms sales policy is to improve our relations with Morocco, I
                            hope you will take into consideration that such a change would
                            inevitably result in a significant confrontation between Congress and
                            the Administration. Even if the opponents of a change in policy were not
                            successful—although once the facts were made known to a currently
                            indifferent Congress, the prospects for passing restrictive legislation
                            would be quite favorable—the confrontation itself would probably do our
                            relations with Morocco more harm than good.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. President, I would hope that instead of increasing the level
                            of militarization of the conflict in the Sahara we could, without taking
                            the lead ourselves, quietly encourage other interested parties, such as
                            Saudi Arabia, Spain and Liberia, to take the initiative in moving the
                            dispute from the battlefield to the conference table. In this regard, I
                            believe it will be helpful if we quietly ease the existing prohibitions
                            on contact between our diplomats and Polisario officials and on visits
                                <pb n="602" facs="0623" xml:id="pg_602"/>by our diplomatic personnel
                            to the Moroccan-held areas of the Western Sahara. For us as a matter of
                            policy to refrain from these potentially informative contacts is to
                            deprive ourselves of the information needed for rational
                            decision-making. We paid a significant political price by depriving
                            ourselves of such contacts in Iran.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you will take these views into consideration in your
                            decision-making on this complex problem. Needless to say, I would be
                            more than happy to meet with you personally to discuss the matter
                            further, if you thought that such a meeting would be useful.<note n="9"

                        <p>A. The U.S. Government has decided to proceed with congressional
                            consultations on the possible sale to Morocco of a limited number of
                            OV–10 aircraft, Cobra-TOW helicopters and other material to be <pb

                                >In telegram 275034 to Algiers, October 21, the Embassy was
                                instructed to inform the Government of Algeria of congressional
                                consultations on the sale of military equipment to Morocco: “As we
                                have previously told <gloss target="#t_GOA_1">GOA</gloss>, the
                                United States, as a friend of Morocco cannot be indifferent to
                                Morocco’s legitimate defense needs. We wish to respond to these
                                needs in a context which will, at the same time, promote meaningful
                                moves on the part of all concerned toward a fair settlement. We hope
                                that if, within this context, Morocco shows an inclination to move
                                toward a settlement, such moves will be reciprocated by Algeria and
                                the Polisario.” (National Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy
                                File, D790483–0146)</note> We are not in a position at this time to
                            predict the result of these consultations but wanted His Majesty to be
                            aware of the direction in which our policy is moving.</p>
                        <p>B. The decision is based on the U.S. desire to support a long time friend
                            of the U.S. in reaching a solution to a difficult problem. At the same
                            time, it is essential that the U.S. and Morocco have a common view of
                            the purpose of this support. That is, it is important that we both
                            understand that a liberalized U.S. military supply policy is for the
                            purpose of stabilizing the situation and thereby encouraging both sides
                            to come to the negotiating table.</p>
                        <p>C. The U.S. believes that the continuation of the conflict in the Sahara
                            is in no one’s interest, including that of Morocco and that the time has
                            now come for Morocco to move from a position of renewed strength to take
                            the lead in negotiating a resolution of the conflict. The U.S. hopes
                            that, by making known its willingness to strengthen Morocco’s defense,
                            the Government of Morocco will be in a better position to negotiate a
                            peaceful resolution with all the parties principally concerned. We will
                            want to undertake discussions at an appropriate time on the full context
                            and implications of the President’s decision. Indications of progress
                            toward a peaceful resolution will play an important part in the
                            implementation of the President’s decision.</p>
                        <p>3. FYI only: While President’s decision involves provision of 6 OV–10
                            aircraft, Cobra-TOW helicopters and other material useful in the Sahara,
                            the full package is conditional on the King’s willingness to negotiate
                            with the Algerians and the Polisario. Decision states the OV–10’s should
                            not be delivered until an actual start is made on negotiations. However,
                            we believe that best tactic is to raise this requirement in a discussion
                            with <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> that follows this
                            initial presentation, and where this requirement could be placed in the
                            context of a description of congressional and other restraints on U.S.
                            policy in this area.</p>

                            Moffat for a wide-ranging two and one-half hour discussion late morning
                            October 30. Flanking the King were his Prime Minister, Foreign Minister,
                            his three Royal Counselors and Moroccan Ambassador to Washington
                                <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> began with an
                            expression of appreciation to the King for receiving him on short notice
                            during a busy holiday week. He had been instructed by the President to
                            come to Morocco as soon as possible to talk to His Majesty. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> elaborated upon
                            the President’s high regard for the King’s role and position, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s support for the
                            U.S. policies in a number of areas. Dep Sec said the President had
                            instructed him to speak to King very directly about the President’s
                            decision to supply additional military equipment to Morocco. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> emphasized the President’s
                            determination to support our friends, and to assist Morocco so that it
                            could seek a peaceful solution from a position of strength.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> detailed the
                            kind of equipment envisaged in the President’s decision and the
                            reasoning behind it. He focused particularly on OV–10’s and TOW-mounted
                            Cobras, indicating that we were less sure of Morocco’s interest in the
                            Cobras, since it had been quite some time since we had heard from the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> on this subject. Should the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOM_1">GOM</gloss> prefer another kind of armed
                            helicopter, such as the Hughes 500, we would try to accommodate their
                            preference. (At the afternoon meeting held with Foreign Minister and the

                            Force Col. Kabbaj indicated to Mr. Murray that a discussion with the
                            King following Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s
                            morning meeting had resulted in a decision to drop the Cobra altogether,
                            and select instead the Hughes MD500, which he described as less costly
                            and less sophisticated and much better suited to Morocco. Col. Kabbaj
                            indicated that he was making a formal request at the King’s
                                instruction).<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">In telegram 285147 to

                        <p>6. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> explained that
                            he was accompanied by Mr. Murray from <gloss target="#t_DOD_1"
                                >DOD</gloss> who was prepared to discuss Morocco’s equipment needs
                            in detail if that was desired. He noted that Mr. Murray had just
                            returned from Saudi Arabia. Given the magnitude of the sales
                            contemplated, they would have to be presented to the Congress. It was
                            important to begin this process as early as possible because the
                            President was anxious to carry this through.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> then gave his
                            analysis of the climate within Congress and emphasized how important it
                            was for Morocco to help us with Congress. We would have an
                            insurmountable problem unless Congress could be convinced that His
                            Majesty sincerely desired meaningful negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8. Though the U.S. had no blueprints for solutions to the conflict in the
                            Western Sahara, and wanted to be neither arbiter nor mediator, we felt
                            the time was ripe for the King to take the lead toward negotiations. Our
                            discussions with the Algerian Government led us to believe that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName>’s government
                            in Algeria does not wish to see a change in the Government of Morocco
                            and on the contrary views the continuation of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s regime as important for
                            stability of the region. We hope the King will now demonstrate the
                            statesmanship he has shown throughout his life by entering into a new
                            phase of negotiations, reflecting his country’s renewed strength.</p>
                        <p>9. We have followed closely the twists and turns of the situation, and
                            believe that negotiations could succeed only if all interested parties
                            participated. We are aware of the difficult situation concerning the
                            Polisario and prescribe no formula, but hope that the King will find
                            some way to include the Polisario in the search for a peaceful
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>10. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> expressed his
                            gratitude to His Majesty for hearing him out and expressed his interest
                            in listening to His Majesty’s views about the manner in which the
                            negotiating process might be started, the form a solution could take, as
                            well as His Majesty’s evalua<pb n="606" facs="0627" xml:id="pg_606"
                            />tion of how the Tunis meeting<note n="3" xml:id="d248fn3">The Arab
                                League Summit was held in Tunis November 20–22.</note> and President
                            Tolbert’s upcoming visit could be used as occasions to move forward on
                            the negotiating front.</p>
                        <p>11. His Majesty responded that he would speak in all candor since he felt
                            that clarity was the best form of diplomacy. He would start with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s last comments.
                            He would have much preferred that this joint working session between
                            long-standing allies and friends could have been devoted to ways of
                            developing Morocco’s resources in the field of energy and production
                            rather than talking about war. His Ambassador in Washington could
                            explain at greater detail that the present state of belligerency had
                            been neither foreseen nor desired by Morocco. Would it be logical to
                            seek peace between Israel and the Arabs, and not want peace between
                            Morocco and Algeria? Peace was His Majesty’s overriding concern for the
                            sake of both his country and his own career. The King indicated that
                            having doubled his borders in the past three years he could think of
                            nothing better than the prospect of peace and regional cooperation.</p>
                        <p>12. He was pleased that his American friends recognized that a stronger
                            Morocco would be in a better position to pursue negotiations. He wanted
                            the President to be assured that the problem of the Sahara was not a
                            territorial problem. The nature of the conflict was the incompatibility
                            between a totalitarian and a democratic regime that could not survive
                            and co-exist in the region. Moscow’s expansionism was opposed by the
                            peoples of the region who do not want to be colonized by Moscow.
                            Negotiations were needed but it would not be easy.</p>
                        <p>13. His Majesty had a political plan in mind and [garble—would share?] it
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName> when the
                            time came. He would communicate it to the President personally. The year
                            1980 would be favorable to peace and negotiations, but Morocco must have
                            the assistance of all its friends in the U.S. and the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>14. The King asserted that Congress would not be so blind as to refuse to
                            help the President, if Congress understood that Morocco was
                            indispensable to the survival of Israel (because if Morocco was lost the
                            Straits of Gibraltar would not be free and Israel could not be
                            resupplied nor could Greece and Turkey be supported). Surely this
                            argument ought to convince hesitant Congressmen.</p>
                        <p>15. His Majesty stated that Libya was at the root of all the problems of
                            the region but Khadafi was not the mastermind, decisions were made in
                            the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>16. <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> then turned to the
                            discussion of military equipment, stressing that the OV–10 was an
                            indispensable weapon for the form of desert warfare forced upon him. It
                            would remain useful for years <pb n="607" facs="0628" xml:id="pg_607"
                            />to come and he thought it might be a good idea to look for ways to
                            reactivate the production line. (In the afternoon staff talks, reported
                            separately, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bengelloun</persName>
                            indicated that they had already talked to Rockwell executives along
                            those lines informally on a number of occasions and that he foresaw no
                            problems).</p>
                        <p>17. The King felt that there should be a joint Saudi-Moroccan approach to
                            Rockwell if the U.S. agreed. The King argued that OV–10s would be of
                            great use in the Arabian Peninsula in countering guerrilla warfare, such
                            as the Dofar rebellion. Mid-air refueling was also a vital need to be
                            met. (At the subsequent staff discussions, the Moroccans indicated that
                            they had chosen the KC–135 for this purpose and might also adapt some of
                            their C–130s for that purpose). The King emphasized that the kind of
                            equipment he needs [garble—must] be conventional, sturdy, lethal and
                            reliable. He described some of the difficulties encountered by equipment
                            in desert warfare conditions and stressed that the Armed Forces plan of
                            1974 had made no provision for desert warfare. No one had thought there
                            would be a war between Algeria and Morocco.</p>
                        <p>18. At this point, however, Morocco knew that the OV–10 was definitely
                            the kind of aircraft it needed. The Cobra also met Moroccan
                            requirements. But six of each would not give Morocco the strong position
                            it needed to negotiate; in fact it would create more dangers for Morocco
                            because it would arouse the enemy without giving Morocco the necessary
                            strength. If six of each was all that he could have he would prefer to
                            turn them down because it would not help him. The King reiterated the
                            need to reactivate the OV10 production line for the sake of a number of
                            countries in the area who would need this kind of defensive aircraft.
                            The U.S., he said, should think in terms of weapons its non-<gloss
                                target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies need.</p>
                        <p>19. The King stressed the importance of obtaining more F5E’s and
                            indicated that in 10 or 15 years Morocco would have the most credible
                            air force in Africa and that this would serve all of Morocco’s friends.
                            At present, aircraft numbers favored Algeria.</p>
                        <p>20. If Algeria stopped supporting the Polisario then Libya would take
                            over completely and this would create a danger for Algeria itself. The
                            King felt that at some point Algeria and Morocco would become objective
                            allies against the threat of Polisario actions. Algeria’s economic
                            situation was very shaky and its agriculture had collapsed. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC_1">Bendjedid</persName> wanted to renounce
                            Boumedienne’s experiments and hoped to achieve a wider opening to the
                            West. However, Libya and Moscow would not let him act freely.</p>
                        <p>21. Algeria and Morocco could inflict considerable damage on one another
                            in a war. It would be a crime for either side to initiate it, and it
                            would take a couple of generations to recover. The King wanted the <pb
                                n="608" facs="0629" xml:id="pg_608"/>President to be convinced that
                            he would not make war against Algeria and would not go beyond his
                            borders. He just needed the means to score a few points in the field.
                            Then he could work on the King’s real problems here: 3.5 percent annual
                            population growth, the need for schools, teachers and food for these
                            growing numbers.</p>
                        <p>22. Morocco’s problem was compounded by its geographical location and the
                            absence of good neighbors. He described Mauritania as being in total
                            disarray and Spain as having to relearn to live within the international
                            community after 40 years of isolation. If Morocco was lost, the Sixth
                            Fleet could go into dry dock. In conclusion the King wanted the
                            President to be assured that he had always been loyal with his partners,
                            even with his enemies. There was all the more reason to be loyal when
                            dealing with a friend like the U.S. and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>.</p>
                        <p>23. If given means to score in the field, he felt that 1980 could bring
                            peace to the region. He had a plan which he would communicate orally to
                            the President when the time came. The sooner he could score the sooner
                            that time would come. He summarized the equipment needs by describing
                            the Cobras, OV10 and F5E as three indispensable links in one continuous
                            chain and pointed out again the inadequacy of numbers since to have one
                            aircraft flying, have to have TOW in maintenance.</p>
                        <p>24. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> responded
                            with a brief technical discussion on the Cobras, F5Es and OV10s and
                            their availability. He explained that the 6 Cobras offered for early
                            delivery would be from our own forces. We were prepared to offer
                            additional Cobras, but these would come from production with a long lead
                            time for delivery. We need an indication from His Majesty so that we can
                            go to Congress and begin the process of consultation.</p>
                        <p>25. At Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>’s request,
                            Mr. Murray explained that our equipment is either in the hands of our
                            own soldiers or in production. We had made a major decision to withdraw
                            OV10s and Cobras from our own inventories. This would enable us to start
                            early delivery with both political and military impact. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> discussed the 20 F5Es
                            which the Moroccans had believed available from the cancelled sale to
                            Egypt. Mr. Murray pointed out that the aircraft were without engines or
                            ground support systems and had been offered to other governments for
                            eventual purchase. Mr. Murray was not sure what other aircraft were
                            available as an alternative to the F5E. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> indicated readiness to hold additional
                            discussions at the expert level in the afternoon as suggested by His
                            Majesty.</p>
                        <p>26. Turning to the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>’s mediation
                            efforts and President Tolbert’s visit, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> asked the King for an evaluation. The King
                            responded that President Tolbert would be here [garble—next Saturday?]
                            and that he would talk about the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>’s
                            role in the Sahara. The <pb n="609" facs="0630" xml:id="pg_609"/>problem
                            was that President Tolbert often changes his mind. African-style
                            palavers were time-consuming. The King was of course himself an African
                            but was also a European by education. The procedure he had in mind would
                            be much quicker and more effective; the King indicated he could say no
                            more at this point. He appreciated importance of the President’s
                            decision. It indicated that the U.S. would not hesitate to choose
                            between its friends and those who are not. It was an important
                            international decision and would be welcomed in Africa to give renewed
                            courage to some who were beginning to worry. If the King wanted the war
                            to drag on he would only ask for smaller quantities of equipment but he
                            did not want the war to go on. He wanted to be able to move rapidly. He
                            reiterated that he wanted the President to be assured that he would not
                            violate Algerian territory or Algerian air space. The process that would
                            lead to peace from a position of strength was taking shape in his mind.
                            He would seek international agreement for it, not just African support
                            alone, because he wanted Morocco to be rid of the problem once and for
                            all. He did not want to say more at this point but would share his plan
                            with the President when the time came.</p>
                        <p>27. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> expressed his
                            gratitude for the time devoted by the King, and the candid discussions
                            of the issues. The President had made an important and difficult
                            decision that indicated our support of a long time friend. The King
                            would see that the implementation of that decision would reflect our
                            determination to stand by our friends.</p>
                        <p>28. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> then asked to
                            see the King privately for a few minutes. He gave him the President’s
                            letter stressing the importance the President attaches to his private
                            correspondence with His Majesty.<note n="4" xml:id="d248fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d179">Document 179</ref>.</note> The King replied he
                            would treat also very confidentially. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                                >Christopher</persName> discussed his forthcoming press comments. A
                            brief discussion of the Tunis Summit resulted in the King’s statement
                            that he felt his presence was required and he would attend. The King
                            said that after Baghdad, the time has come to restore a calm atmosphere.
                            The King expressed his hope for an early arrival of Ambassador and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> confirmed that
                            this would be around December 1. In parting the King asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> to convey his strong
                            personal regards to the President, to Mrs. Carter and to “his friend”

                            the Spanish Minister of the Presidency, Mr. José Pedro Perez-Llorca y
                            Rodrigo, at the latter’s request. In setting up the meeting, <pb n="611"
                                facs="0632" xml:id="pg_611"/>the Spanish Ambassador explained to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1">Haynes</persName> that the
                            Minister, who was heading up Spain’s delegation to the Algerian 25th
                            anniversary celebration of the revolution, wanted to take advantage of
                            his presence in the same place with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> to discuss, in particular, the problem of the
                            Western Sahara. In opening his remarks, the Minister explained to Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> that he wanted to
                            talk about Spain’s concern for this region as he thought it would be
                            helpful to have such a preliminary discussion in preparation for future
                            meetings in Madrid.<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">See <ref target="#d255"
                                    >Document 255</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The Minister explained that Spain was concerned about the state of
                            Morocco’s military preparedness and about the present political
                            situation in the region posed by the warfare in the Sahara. He said that
                            it was the Spanish view that the U.S. global interests required us to be
                            interested in the current problems in North Africa, but that Spain has a
                            very direct regional interest in North African developments because of
                            the problems it is having with the liberation movement for the Canary
                            Islands and the constant threat that Morocco will one day swallow up the
                            Spanish enclaves in its territory. In addition, he said that any
                            intensification in the Sahara situation inevitably affects Spain, citing
                            as one example of such an effect the fact that Spain is in the same
                            position as the United States as a big purchaser of Algerian oil and
                            gas.</p>
                        <p>Spain, he said, has observed an apparent change in U.S. policy in North
                            Africa. He felt that Spain would agree with the United States that
                            Morocco must be stabilized, but was not sure that he understood the
                            subtle shades of the changed U.S. policy. Therefore, he specifically
                            asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> whether the
                            U.S. has an outline of what it thought might be a peaceful solution to
                            the Sahara crisis.</p>
                        <p>In replying, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said
                            that the U.S. does not have a specific view of the nature of a
                            settlement. He expressed the opinion that the nature of any eventual
                            settlement was probably unclear even to the actual participants in the
                            Sahara conflict themselves. However, the U.S. judgment is that neither
                            side has the ability to impose a military solution on the other without
                            engaging in a mutually destructive war. The United States does feel, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said, that in
                            time there will be movement toward a political solution through means of
                            indirect approaches of third parties. It must be understood that the
                            U.S. does not intend to become a mediator in this dispute, preferring to
                            leave that to the Arab countries, the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> and ultimately to Algeria and Morocco themselves.
                            Nevertheless, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            emphasized, it is the U.S. concern not to have a military solution
                            imposed on a friend of <pb n="612" facs="0633" xml:id="pg_612"/>the U.S.
                            and it is important that anyone with any ideas of imposing such a
                            solution see this clearly. He added that as long as one side or the
                            other feels that it can prevail militarily, there will be no impetus to
                            negotiate.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> continued that the
                            U.S. is counting on common sense in Algeria and Morocco to create the
                            conditions for a solution. Just when or how those conditions will be
                            created, no one knows at this time. At the same time, we cannot ignore
                            the growth in Algerian military strength which is readily explained by
                            virtue of the fact that Algeria won its liberation struggle with
                            arms.</p>
                        <p>The Minister agreed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName>’s view that the Algerians were building up
                            militarily and compared them to the old-time Prussians. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> felt they were more like
                            the old-time Polish nationalists with whom they shared a revolutionary
                            mystique with a sometimes inflated sense of their strength, but
                            ultimately quite realistic. He told the Minister that he was moderately
                            optimistic that Algeria would not ultimately seek a military
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> whether it was the political aim of the
                            United States to keep the conflict and the expectations of people in
                            that conflict as low as possible. He continued by asking for Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s assessment of
                            the situation which saw Morocco’s isolation increasing in the world
                            community at the same time that support for the Algerian position was
                            growing. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> replied
                            that it was, indeed, this phenomenon of isolation which made it
                            essential for the Moroccans to find a formula that would give the people
                            of the Western Sahara an opportunity to express their desire for
                            self-determination.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> if the United States saw this conflict in the
                            Sahara becoming part of the East-West struggle. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> replied that so long as
                            this conflict does not escalate, it will remain outside of the East-West
                            struggle. However, if the conflict escalates, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> felt there was a good
                            chance that it could become a new element in the East-West struggle. The
                            Minister then asked whether the U.S. felt that furnishing arms was one
                            way to prevent escalation of the conflict. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> replied that he felt that
                            this action of the U.S. would keep King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> from lashing out in frantic anxiety. He then
                            asked the Minister how Spain assessed the situation.</p>
                        <p>In reply, the Minister said that Spain felt that there was a sense of
                            frustration in the Moroccan army and in certain of the internal
                            political forces in Morocco. Frustration, he said, tends to radicalize
                            positions. Therefore, Spain would certainly share the U.S. view that
                            King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> will need a state of
                            tranquility in order to make the right decisions.</p>
                        <p>At this point Director General Aguirrebengoa expressed the opinion that,
                            beginning about a year ago King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> abandoned long-<pb n="613" facs="0634"
                                xml:id="pg_613"/>range planning in favor of conducting his war
                            effort on a day-to-day basis. The Director General felt that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> had to do so in order to give
                            himself the flexibility to restrain his army and certain other forces in
                            his country from acting out of desperation. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> then asked the Director
                            General whether he felt that our decision on arms supply to Morocco
                            would be helpful. The Director General replied that such a decision
                            would only be helpful if it does not escalate the war; but, he felt that
                            there was a great danger that escalation could result from the
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that our common objective is to prevent the
                            destabilization of Morocco. Should the King lose his throne, a successor
                            government that was characterized by either a left-wing or a highly
                            nationalistic regime would pose serious problems to Spain and within
                            Spain and could have a serious impact on Spain’s internal politics.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> then asked the
                            Minister whether the Spanish had any expectations that the current
                            situation would result when they handed over the Spanish Sahara to the
                            joint administration of Morocco and Mauritania. The Minister replied
                            that none of his generation in the Spanish Government had been involved
                            in those events at that time. He said that <persName corresp="#p_FF_1"
                                >Franco</persName>’s politicians had several alternative choices to
                            face up to in giving up the Spanish Sahara: (a) allow a war to be waged
                            for control of the territory, (b) seek a provisional arrangement which
                            would allow Spain to get out of its colonial administration peacefully,
                            or (c) get out altogether without any arrangement and risk a clash
                            inevitably between Morocco and Algeria. All the current generation can
                            do at this stage is wonder what it would have done at that time under
                            the same circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of population in the former Spanish Sahara, the
                            Minister said that he felt it was a complete mystery. It was clear,
                            however, that the people who inhabit the territory from time to time
                            were nomadic tribes, often with some connection or relationship to each
                            other, who did not acknowledge colonial or national frontiers. At about
                            the time that Spain gave up its administration, Spanish authorities were
                            trying to count and to settle the population. On this basis, the
                            official figure that the Spanish arrived at for a referendum in 1974 was
                            73,563. He said that Algeria’s claim that the population is 1,000,000 is
                            pure nonsense. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            said that it would certainly be helpful if the Spanish could turn over
                            their population records to some impartial authority. The Director
                            General said that they had already given sixty pounds of such documents
                            to the United Nations in January 1978 and that those documents included
                            such specific information as names, numbers in family and literacy. The
                            Spanish estimate that they may have missed at the most 8,000 or 10,000
                            of the nomadic occupants of the territory in their census.</p>
                        <pb n="614" facs="0635" xml:id="pg_614"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> asserted that,
                            because of the Spanish experience in the Western Sahara, they were
                            perhaps best able to say what in fact were the basic desires of the
                            people of the territory. The Director General replied that, in the past,
                            none of the people of the territory had any notion of nationalism, but
                            that since 1975 a definite spirit of nationalism had developed,
                            particularly in the refugee camps in the Tindouf area. As a result, he
                            said, now one has to consider all of the related tribal peoples of the
                            Sahara who have been politicized and who have acquired a sense of
                            nationalism, and he would consider this number something closer to
                            200,000.</p>
                        <p>The Minister was quick to point out that if this number of politicized
                            nomadic and tribal peoples prevail in their struggle to control the
                            Western Sahara, a destabilizing situation will be created in which all
                            of the areas over which they roam will be placed in dispute. This, he
                            said, could include southern Morocco and all of Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>The Director General, returning to the subject, expressed the opinion
                            that the problem was no longer one of decolonization. He said that the
                            politicized Sahraoui are clearly more than the 73,000 in the last
                            Spanish census and that they are a reality with which we must deal. As
                            such, they represent a real danger to Morocco and Mauritania. If the
                            Sahara conflict is not resolved in a way that gives them some homeland,
                            the problem is sure to expand. Unfortunately, Spain has not only lost
                            time, but has also lost control, in working toward such a solution. The
                            Minister continued that if there is a bad solution to the Sahara
                            conflict, Spain will be a principal loser. In this connection, he
                            emphasized that Spain does not want to see a triumphant hegemonic
                            Morocco any more than it wants to see such an Algeria.</p>
                        <p>Referring to possible solutions, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> indicated that King <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> was toying with the idea of
                            turning Mauritania into a sovereign Sahraoui state. The Director General
                            responded that, in the past, this might have been a logical and natural
                            solution and that all of Mauritania and the Tiris El Gharbia might have
                            been reconstituted into a Sahraoui state. But, now it is too late.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that it would now be impossible to return to a status
                            quo ante in which the inhabitants of the Western Sahara could be led
                            peacefully to vote on whether they wanted their freedom or wanted to be
                            associated with Morocco.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HUSC_1">Haynes</persName> asked the
                            Spanish present whether they felt that the Polisario could be identified
                            with any particular political ideology. The Director General replied
                            that, at the start of this conflict, the Polisario was attempting to
                            indoctrinate the people in a socialist ideology in the manner of
                            Algeria’s <gloss target="#t_FLN_1">FLN</gloss>. However, as far as their
                            possible Communist orientation was concerned, the Director General was
                            of the opinion that Communism would not find a fertile ground <pb
                                n="615" facs="0636" xml:id="pg_615"/>among the Sahraoui because of
                            certain firmly entrenched religious and cultural traditions. The
                            Minister added that, in any scenario in which the Polisario succeeds in
                            obtaining some territory with which to create a state, that state could
                            only be organized in the radical socialist mode. The problem would then
                            become who would be that state’s “big brother”: Algeria or some Eastern
                            Bloc power? But such a scenario would definitely destabilize Morocco
                            because it would then be surrounded on all sides by incompatible
                            regimes.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Ambassador asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> what had happened in his meeting yesterday
                            with Algerian Foreign Minister Benyahia.<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d75">Document 75</ref>. <persName

                                    76</ref>.</note> Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> replied that he had told the Foreign Minister
                            that he did not expect Algeria to “approve” the <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                >USG</gloss> decision, but did feel it was important that he
                            “understand” it. In this connection, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> told the Foreign Minister that the U.S. aim
                            was (a) to seek a political settlement, (b) to provide the basis for the
                            parties to the conflict to think in political terms, and (c) to let the
                            Algerians know that the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> stands
                            behind its friends. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> said that, after having had several contacts
                            with Algerian leaders, he was convinced that they were fairly realistic.
                            He did not have the impression that they were eager to intensify the
                            conflict. Thinking out loud, the Minister responded to this latter point
                            by asking, “But, what if Morocco resorts to ‛hot pursuit’?”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that he is
                            sure that all parties feel a “political solution” would mean an outcome
                            that they desire. However, he said that he had impressed upon the
                            Algerian Foreign Minister the fact that a political solution will mean
                            that neither the Algerians nor the Moroccans will achieve their optimum
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>He concluded the discussion of the Western Sahara by saying that he was
                            impressed with the realism of the Algerian leadership whose stands were
                            not emotional. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                            said that the U.S. desires to keep bilateral channels of communication
                            open to them. He said that it was essential that this struggle not grow
                            into one that changes Algeria from a realistic, independent, radical
                            power into one that is ideologically aligned. To do so would only
                            internationalize the problem.</p>

                        <p>I would like to take the occasion of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAB_1">Duke</persName>’s arrival in Rabat to reiterate
                            our interest in a continuing close relationship with a strong Morocco at
                            peace with its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>Now that we have begun the process of notifying Congress of our
                            intentions to provide Morocco with new forms and quantities of military
                            equipment, I hope that you will move boldly toward the achievement of a
                            negotiated settlement of the dispute in the Western Sahara. Such an
                            initiative would be particularly useful to us as we proceed with the
                            process of Congressional consultations on specific sales. I hope an
                            occasion will arise soon which will provide the opportunity for a
                            tangible step toward negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The volatile nature of current world events makes it all the more
                            important that the Western Sahara dispute be resolved peacefully before
                            it can be exploited by other interests. I was particularly pleased when
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName>
                            reported to me that you have a plan for negotiations in 1980 that you
                            will communicate to me at the appropriate time.<note n="2"

                                >Hassan</persName> mentioned that “after year and a half” he had
                            gotten discussions started again with the Algerians. Talks had taken
                            place a few days previously and would resume “in earnest” in the next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>3. From other sources we have learned that Royal Counselor <persName

                            and met with the Algerians on January 25. To the best of our knowledge

                            reinforce my earlier contention that the Moroccans have essentially done
                            what we wanted in demonstrating their willingness—and what appears
                            increasingly as eagerness—to talk seriously about the Sahara.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> replied that he hoped so. He

                            imagine that man. <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> thinks
                            nothing of calling the King to announce that Morocco has just seized
                            some of Spain’s fishing boats and in the same breath complains that
                            Spain isn’t supporting Morocco on the Sahara. The King said he told
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> that the latter knows
                            very well what is expected of Morocco. And yet <persName

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> laughed and told the King he would

                            far away from being willing to talk seriously about the conflict.
                            Suarez, during his visit there, had the same impression. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The President</hi> asked the King if he thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> was approaching a
                            time of talking. (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The King</hi> replied that if <persName

                            may be willing to talk; but if he finds that people, on patriotic and
                            nationalistic grounds support him, he will stay as he is. The King went
                            on to say that in 1974 the Spanish were in a sense traitors on the
                            question of <pb n="619" facs="0640" xml:id="pg_619"/>self-determination.
                            They should have pushed this more. In any case, the King added, he has a
                            small feeling that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> may
                            not be so strong internally. For example, he has made Dlimi general. And
                            after all, what is Dlimi? (C)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Queen Sofia</hi> asked if Dlimi would go against

                        <p><hi rend="italic">The King</hi> replied that he didn’t know. He hoped

                        <p>2. Summary: <gloss target="#t_NEAAFN_1">NEA/AFN</gloss> Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> and Deputy Director
                            Smith met Polisario representative Majid Abdullah at <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName>’s house April 3. Abdullah took
                            standard Polisario position and indicated no flexibility at his level.
                            He did emphasize that Polisario did not claim any portion of what <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> considers Morocco proper. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> explained U.S. policy and
                            overriding U.S. interest in encouraging all parties to move toward
                            peaceful compromise solution of Western Sahara conflict. He expressed
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> concern about attacks in
                            Morocco proper and said future contact would be difficult in context
                            such attacks. End summary.</p>
                        <p>3. Meeting, which was first full exchange between Department
                            representatives and Polisario, opened with both sides expressing
                            pleasure that contact had finally been established. Majid noted
                            importance Polisario attached to <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss>
                            position and hoped that meeting would be followed by other contacts. He
                            acknowledged that he was not in a position to go beyond his
                            organization’s standard policy and suggested it would be helpful for
                            future contacts to include higher-level Polisario representatives.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> did not react
                            specifically to this but did return to subject later, noting difficulty
                            future contacts when Polisario attacking in Morocco proper (see
                            below).</p>
                        <p>4. Majid presented Polisario as national liberation movement. He
                            emphasized territorial as opposed to tribal base for organization. It
                            was losing its young men in the fighting but was willing to continue the
                            struggle. Morocco, he argued, was the aggressor, and the Polisario’s
                            objective was to keep it from winning. It was not opposed to the regime
                            in Morocco and did not claim any of Morocco proper. It recognized the
                            need to “save face” for King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName>. However, he had taken a harder line following
                            the U.S. arms supply decision. Morocco was no longer willing to meet
                            with the Polisario, although such a meeting had occurred a year ago in
                            Bamako, where Gen. Dlimi and Royal Counselors <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Reda Guedira</persName> and Bensouda had
                            represented Morocco.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> emphasized <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> view that compromise solution would be
                            necessary. Purpose of our arms supply decision was to encourage <pb
                                n="621" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_621"/>movement toward such solution.
                            Earlier policy had not visibly helped improve situation, and in addition
                            had harmed U.S. interests in Morocco and our ability to communicate with
                            highest level of Moroccan Government. We had therefore changed our
                            position in an effort to re-establish our ability to make our views
                            known to Morocco. We had also decided to visit Western Sahara and to
                            have official contact with Polisario. We had not, however, changed our
                            position on substance of the problem. We continued to be neutral on
                            eventual status of territory. We did not recognize Moroccan sovereignty.
                            Also, we did not recognize Polisario claims to the territory (and
                            meeting with Majid did not indicate recognition of those claims).</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> continued by noting that
                            we believed neither side could win a military victory. He drew Majid’s
                            attention to Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SHH_1"

                            believe Morocco could win a military victory. On other hand, we did not
                            believe Polisario could win either, in view of Morocco’s much larger
                            population and resource base. Also, Polisario victory would have
                            destabilizing effect in region which would not serve interests of
                            anybody, including Polisario. It could lead to overthrow of King
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, which would probably
                            result in military, more hawkish Moroccan regime. (Majid disputed this
                            point, arguing that Polisario felt Moroccan military was more realistic
                            about situation than was the King.)</p>

                                >Coon</persName> explained, did not claim to have more expertise on
                            the subject than the parties themselves, and it was for them to work out
                            modalities for negotiations and for a compromise solution. We believed a
                            real compromise was necessary, but we would not offer suggestions on how
                            that might be achieved. Negotiations might be possible with the
                            Polisario as a member of the Algerian delegation, but it was really for
                            the parties to work out the “shape of the table”. We wanted to do what
                            we could to encourage the parties but would not rpt not serve as
                            mediators ourselves. The dispute was not of our making; we wished to get
                            on the business of cooperating with all of the peoples and governments
                            of the region in pursuit of shared goals of economic and social
                            development.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> position in the future would be
                            influenced by degree of flexibility shown by the parties to the
                            conflict.</p>

                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName> then pointed out that a
                            second reason for our policy review last year<note n="3"

                            Morocco proper. Polisario should understand that attacks in Morocco
                            proper significantly changed the situation, bringing into play historic
                            U.S. friendship and support for Morocco. Polisario should be aware of
                            how widely this view was held within the United States.</p>
                        <p>10. In particular, <persName corresp="#p_CCS_1">Coon</persName>
                            continued, whole question of his meeting with Majid had been thrown into
                            doubt by recent very large scale fighting in southern Morocco. Future
                            contacts would not be automatic and were not guaranteed. They would be
                            difficult in the context of such attacks.</p>
                        <p>11. Majid replied by reiterating that Polisario did not claim territory
                            in what <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> considers Morocco proper,
                            but it considers there is military justification to pursue attacks
                            there. Polisario believed that colonial frontiers were best left
                            unchanged, and it did not claim Tarfaya Province, which had become part
                            of Morocco in 1959. However, Morocco had important bases within Morocco
                            proper used for military operations in the south. He named specifically
                            Tan Tan, Zaag, Ngueb, Zagora, Agadir and Goulimime. Moreover, Morocco
                            did not recognize any distinction between Morocco proper and the Western
                            Sahara. Therefore, Polisario felt it fully justified to attack in the
                            southern part of Morocco proper. He added, that in the case of the
                            latest fighting Morocco had taken the initiative, not the Polisario.</p>
                        <p>12. Meeting concluded amicably but with clear understanding that as far
                            as U.S. concerned, future meetings were not guaranteed.</p>

                        <p>2. Following is an uncleared draft memorandum of part of the conversation
                            between the President and Prime Minister Suarez at the Prime Minister’s
                            office, with Spanish Ambassador Llado and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> present, on June 25. A separate
                            cable reports the other main subject discussed.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d255fn2">Telegram 9701 from Madrid, July 1. (National
                                Archives, RG 59, Central Foreign Policy File,
                            P880031–0106)</note></p>
                        <p>3. The President asked for Suarez’s views on North Africa and Western
                            Sahara. He was aware that there were many who did not believe that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> intended to negotiate
                            and he understood that the Spanish Government also thought that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> might threaten the
                            Spanish enclaves on the African continent. In view of the Spanish
                            special interests in this issue he wondered what possible solutions the
                            Spanish saw.</p>
                        <p>4. Suarez said it was a very difficult situation with no good solution in
                            sight. The official Spanish position was in favor of self-determination
                            for the Saharoui people. Spain recognized the Polisario as representing
                            the Saharoui people in struggle but not as representative of the whole
                            of the Saharoui people. However, the Polisario does have full support
                            from Libya and Algeria, and recently it reportedly has obtained support
                            from Mauritania where it might find territory for establishing a state.
                            The creation of a Saharoui republic was included on the agenda for the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> meeting in Sierra Leone and
                            there was a good chance that the Polisario might receive the necessary
                            additional recognition for the admission of the Saharoui state. In that
                            case, Morocco would leave the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> said his
                            information from some Africans was that other <gloss target="#t_OAU_1"
                                >OAU</gloss> members might also leave the organization in that case,
                            thus causing a split which most members wished to avoid. He <pb n="625"
                                facs="0646" xml:id="pg_625"/>understood that an effort would be made
                            to establish another study commission in order to postpone the issue
                            while attempts continued toward a negotiated solution.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d255fn3">At the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> Summit
                                in Freetown July 1–4, the issue of Polisario admission, which
                                divided the member nations, was postponed. (Leon Dash, “Angry Debate
                                on Western Sahara War Dominated Meeting of African Leaders,” <hi
                                    rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, July 5, 1980, p.
                            A8)</note></p>
                        <p>6. Suarez said that Morocco also wished to see the issue postponed and
                            had just proposed that a two-thirds majority be required to approve the
                            recognition of a Saharoui state. He believed that the majority of the
                            African states favored postponement while seeking some arrangement
                            between Morocco and Algeria.</p>
                        <p>7. Suarez said he had been pleased to learn from the President during
                            their Washington meeting that the U.S. intended to provide arms to
                            Morocco only in an amount sufficient to defend itself and give it the
                            strength and confidence to negotiate but not enough for a military
                                victory.<note n="4" xml:id="d255fn4"><persName corresp="#p_CJE_1"
                                    >Carter</persName> and Suarez met in the Cabinet Room at the
                                White House on January 14 from 12:39 to 2:20 p.m. (Carter Library,
                                Presidential Materials, President’s Daily Diary) For the text of the
                                White House statement released that day, see <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE_1">Carter</persName>,
                                    1980–81</hi>, Book I, pp. 82–83.</note> The problem, as he saw
                            it, was that Morocco wanted the entire former Spanish area and of course
                            that was impossible to achieve especially without some understanding
                            with Algeria. Libya was now exacerbating the situation by working
                            closely with the Soviet Union and providing increased assistance to the
                            Polisario. This worried Algeria to a point where it was anxious for a
                            political solution. The difficulty was that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> seemed unwilling to negotiate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> wants Spain to side fully with
                            Morocco over this issue while Algeria wants Spain to side with the
                            Polisario. Spain’s efforts are aimed at seeking a reasonable balance in
                            the area. Spain wished to see <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> continue in power and believed that Algeria
                            shared this view, but unfortunately there did not appear to be any way
                            to get <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s cooperation. The
                            Algerian President had expressed willingness to hold talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> and other Arab
                            leaders, including Fahd, and had agreed to assist in arranging for the
                            meetings but <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> had
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>8. Suarez added that Spain had an additional problem with Morocco over a
                            fishing agreement which had been signed in 1977 and ratified by the
                            Spanish Parliament only after a prolonged and bitter debate on grounds
                            that the agreement had appeared to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over
                            the entire area. Nevertheless, Morocco has still not ratified the
                            agreement. There have been temporary agreements, the last of which is
                            due to expire on June 30. The Spanish offer to Morocco has been very
                            generous in terms of credits offered and assistance to modernize the
                            Moroccan fishing fleet. However, in the negotia<pb n="626" facs="0647"
                                xml:id="pg_626"/>tions Morocco has been pressing as well for the
                            right to transport citrus and other fruits and vegetables through Spain
                            to Europe. This poses very serious problems since Morocco has to pay
                            only a 4 percent duty while Spain must pay 12 percent. Spanish producers
                            were totally opposed to allowing transport of the Moroccan produce and
                            had threatened direct action to prevent it. At the same time, the people
                            of the Canary Islands, who are interested in fishing, wish to see a
                            fishing agreement signed as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>9. Suarez said the Spanish Government had the impression that Morocco was
                            prepared to exert pressure on Ceuta and Melilla in order to try to force
                            the Spanish hand in the negotiations. If Morocco were to do that then he
                            could assure the President that Spain would react violently. Spain
                            realized that the two small enclaves were difficult to defend;
                            therefore, Spain would have to take offensive action. Plans were ready
                            for such action but he prayed that he would never have to put them into
                            effect. The President said that would mean war and Suarez replied,
                            “exactly.” Suarez said a delegation would be leaving on June 26 for
                            negotiations with Morocco. He hoped it would succeed in reaching some
                            agreement to permit continuation of normal relations after June 30.</p>
                        <p>10. Suarez said the matter of Spanish exports was further complicated now
                            because of the problems that France was creating for Spain by stopping
                            or even burning trucks carrying Spanish produce. He expected to receive
                            French Prime Minister Barre next week to try to reach some agreement on
                            several outstanding issues, including agricultural trade, the Common
                            Market and terrorism.</p>
                        <p>11. Suarez said that Spain had also had problems with Algeria which had
                            been supporting the Basque terrorist group, ETA, as well as the Canary
                            Independence Movement led by Cubillo. However, that stage seems to have
                            passed and relations with Algeria were getting better. A major project
                            exists now for the construction of a pipeline for Algerian gas to pass
                            through Spain to Europe.</p>
                        <p>12. The President said it appeared that <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> was becoming increasingly isolated and that he
                            should realize that he needed Spain. It was difficult to see how
                                <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> could expect to
                            obtain transport rights under the conditions which Suarez had described
                            or what <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> could expect to
                            gain by exerting pressure against Ceuta and Melilla.</p>
                        <p>13. Suarez said that in six to seven months, after Spain had been able to
                            make some new arrangements with the Common Market and to deal with the
                            special situations in the Canaries and in Valencia, it might be possible
                            to work out an arrangement for the transport of Moroccan produce, but it
                            was not possible right now.</p>
                        <p>14. The President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1"
                                >Todman</persName> what he thought we could do to help and the
                            Ambassador suggested that in view of the <pb n="627" facs="0648"
                                xml:id="pg_627"/>gravity of the situation as described by Suarez and
                            the action he indicated he was prepared to take, it would be well for us
                            to advise <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>15. Suarez said Spain could always sign a fishing agreement with the
                            Polisario, which would in fact be to Spain’s advantage since the best
                            fishing grounds were off the parts of the Sahara claimed by the
                            Polisario. However, Spain did not want to go that far since it still
                            wished to be as helpful to <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> as possible.</p>
                        <p>16. The President said maybe we could let <persName corresp="#p_HII_1"
                                >Hassan</persName> know of the Spanish fears and of our own view
                            that any attack against the Spanish enclaves would be a very serious
                            matter and would not be looked at favorably by the United States.</p>
                        <p>17. In answer to a question by the President on how long had Ceuta and
                            Melilla belonged to Spain, Suarez replied for more than 500 years and
                            certainly well before the creation of Morocco as a country. Spain had
                            been trying very hard and will continue to try to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName> but they find him to be a very
                            clever, astute person who cannot be trusted to keep his word. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>’s actions over the next few
                            days on the fishing agreement would greatly influence the future course
                            of Spanish-Moroccan relations.</p>

                        <p>202300. Subject: Reported Moroccan Policy of Pursuit Across International
                            Borders.</p>
                        <p>1. (S) Entire text.</p>
                        <p>2. We are concerned at current indications that increased Moroccan combat
                            effectiveness may be accompanied by increased tendency toward pursuit of
                            Polisario forces including temporary violations of international
                            frontiers. These indications include possible recent penetrations of
                            Algerian and Mauritanian airspace by <gloss target="#t_RMAF_1"
                                >RMAF</gloss> aircraft. <pb n="628" facs="0649" xml:id="pg_628"
                            />Recently, we have statement to us by Moroccan source<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d256fn2">Not found.</note> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>] that the <gloss target="#t_RMAF_1"
                                >RMAF</gloss> is now prepared to pursue Polisario even if it means
                            violating neighbor’s air space. Source also indicated that eventual
                            attacks against Polisario bases in Algeria or Moroccan-Algerian aircraft
                            dog-fights could not be ruled out.</p>
                        <p>3. Department cannot view with equanimity an apparent development of
                            Moroccan tactical doctrine which entails significant new risk of
                            engaging Morocco in a direct military confrontation with Algeria. We
                            believe therefore that at an early opportunity you should convey our
                            concern to King <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>, either
                            directly or through suitable intermediary. Circumstances of Moroccan
                            source’s talk with our people were such that you cannot refer directly
                            to it in discussion with <persName corresp="#p_HII_1">Hassan</persName>
                            but we believe you can make the point by indirection.</p>
                        <p>4. In formulating your specific message, you may incorporate the
                            following talking points:</p>
                        <p>—We continue strongly to support the goal of a compromise settlement in
                            terms that all interested parties and particularly Morocco can live
                            with.</p>
                        <p>—We understand Morocco’s need to make a strong military performance
                            against Polisario. This was an important concern underlying the changes
                            we made in our arms policy last fall.</p>
                        <p>—While we have made clear our continuing support for Morocco’s
                            territorial integrity, we have at the same time believed that that
                            integrity would not be enhanced by any widening of the war, particularly
                            if it involved Algeria.</p>
                        <p>—We told the Polisario this spring that we would not maintain a
                            continuing dialogue with them while they were operating inside territory
                            of Morocco.<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">See <ref target="#d253">Document
                                    253</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>—We are therefore concerned at recent reports that in late June or early
                            July <gloss target="#t_RMAF_1">RMAF</gloss> aircraft entered Algerian
                            air space in pursuit of Polisario forces. We understand that similar
                            incursion may have occurred in Mauritania.</p>
                        <p>—We hope that this does not mean that henceforth Moroccan combat aircraft
                            and perhaps other forces may be authorized to follow doctrine of pursuit
                            of retreating Polisario forces into Algerian territory. We find it easy
                            to construct scenario under which this could quickly lead to a serious
                            confrontation between two countries.</p>
                        <p>—We do not believe such a doctrine of hot pursuit is needed to persuade
                            either the Polisario or the Algerian leadership of the impor<pb n="629"
                                facs="0650" xml:id="pg_629"/>tance of compromise as a prerequisite
                            of a negotiated settlement. On the contrary, an extension of the war
                            resulting from hot pursuit could adversely affect Moroccan position
                            internationally and in the U.S.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> received us at home,
                            alone. Meeting lasted an hour and was cordial throughout.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador opened with presentation of Deputy Secretary’s message
                            (second <gloss target="#t_reftel_1">reftel</gloss>) which <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> received with pleasure, asking
                            for copy to show to King (later same day).</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador, noting he was speaking under instruction, then moved to
                            question of Moroccan policy with respect to pursuit across international
                            borders. He rehearsed points made in para 4 first <gloss

                            firm response from <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> along
                            following lines:</p>
                        <p>A. King, from outset, has been concerned to contain conflict with Algeria
                            at lowest possible level. As consequence, when Polisario began to attack
                            incontestably Moroccan territory from Algeria and to retreat <pb n="630"
                                facs="0651" xml:id="pg_630"/>into Algeria (which, from the point of
                            view of international law, places responsibility squarely upon Algeria),
                            King wrote <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Boumediene</persName> a letter,
                            which <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> said he drafted.
                            Letter stated that Morocco had not heretofore exercised right of hot
                            pursuit (droit de suite) and did not now intend to do so, but should not
                            be pushed too far.</p>
                        <p>B. <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName>, in response
                            Ambassador’s question, said he knew King’s mind and will on this issue
                            and could affirm unequivocally that Morocco’s policy had not rpt not
                            changed. What had triggered these representations from a friendly
                            government?</p>
                        <p>C. Ambassador, having adverted to June/July <gloss target="#t_RMAF_1"
                                >RMAF</gloss> penetration of Algerian airspace and possible recent

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> nodded and said that
                            Algiers had protested at the time through Tunisian Ambassador here
                            (Tunisia is Algeria’s protecting power in Morocco since rupture between
                            Rabat and Algiers). Moroccans had responded that incident was
                            inadvertent (“border is hard to determine at jet speed”), aggression
                            against Algeria was not rpt not intended, and Morocco’s posture on droit
                            de suite remained unchanged.</p>

                            dispute to talk. King’s attitude had been constant. It was unchanged.
                            King would not do anything vis-a-vis Algeria, particularly now (read in

                        <p>E. <persName corresp="#p_GAR_1">Guedira</persName> went on to express
                            “our” deep preoccupation with the trend of Mauritanian policy towards
                            Morocco. “They are worse than the Algerians”. He denied any Moroccan
                            incursion and pointed to incoherence of Mauritanian allegations of
                            Moroccan attacks first on this town then on that one etc. He asked
                            whether we knew that population of Nouadhibou had demonstrated July 31
                            “against <gloss target="#t_GIRM_1">GIRM</gloss>’s lies”? Ambassador
                            responded that Boulanouar admittedly very close to border; Mauritanians
                            had, however, shown our Charge American-made ordnance which, they
                            asserted, was used by Moroccan aircraft in the alleged incident.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador closed this part of conversation by presenting <persName

                            authors’ understanding of Morocco’s interest in moving towards a
                            negotiated solution of the Saharan problem, a crucial point.</p>
                        <p>6. Conversation then moved to subject of Morocco’s post-<gloss

                            by our Charge in Nouakchott lends credence to the view that ordnance
                            struck ground up to 6 km inside Mauritanian territory. The Moroccan
                            action was apparently limited to a couple of strafing runs close to
                            Mauritania’s border with the western Sahara. The Mauritanians have
                            chosen to make a major issue of it. They withdrew their Ambassador from

                            the use of U.S. arms in Moroccan aggression, since unexploded rockets
                            allegedly found after the “attack” were of U.S. origin, as confirmed by
                            our Charge’s onsite inspection.<note n="5" xml:id="d258fn5">In telegram
