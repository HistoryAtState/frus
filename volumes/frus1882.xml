                <head>Message of the President of the United States.</head>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">To the Senate and House of Representatives of
                        the United States:</hi></p>
                <p>It is provided by the Constitution that the President shall from time to time
                    give to the Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to
                    their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.</p>
                <p>In reviewing the events of the year which has elapsed since the commencement of
                    your sessions, I first call your attention to the gratifying condition of our
                    foreign affairs. Our intercourse with other powers has continued to be of the
                    most friendly character.</p>
                <p>Such slight differences as have arisen during the year have been already settled
                    or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of citizens of the United
                    States in Ireland under recent laws which owe their origin to the disturbed
                    condition of that country has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with the
                    Government of Great Britain. A disposition to respect our rights has been
                    practically manifested by the release of the arrested parties.</p>
                <p>The claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of any
                    inter-oceanic canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the subject
                    of conference.</p>
                <p>It is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing the
                    divergence between the two nations whose friendship is so closely cemented by
                    the intimacy of their relations and the community of their interests.</p>
                <p>Our long-established friendliness with Russia has remained unshaken. It has
                    prompted me to proffer the earnest counsels of this government that measures be
                    adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race in that country
                    has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any American citizen has been
                    subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous remonstrance has nevertheless
                    been courteously received. There is reason to believe that the time is not far
                    distant when Russia will be able to secure toleration to all faiths within her
                    borders.</p>
                <p>At an international convention held at Paris in 1880, and attended by
                    representatives of the United States, an agreement was reached in respect to the
                    protection of trade-marks, patented articles, and the rights of manufacturing
                    firms and corporations. The formulating into <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV"
                        facs="0022"/>treaties of the recommendations thus adopted is receiving the
                    attention which it merits.</p>
                <p>The protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration by an
                    international conference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly the true policy
                    of this government to favor the neutralization of this means of intercourse, I
                    requested our minister to France to attend the convention as a delegate. I also
                    designated two of our eminent scientists to attend as our representatives at the
                    meeting of an international committee at Paris, for considering the adoption of
                    a common unit to measure electric force.</p>
                <p>In view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration of
                    important matters of common interest to civilized nations, I respectfully
                    suggest that the Executive be invested by Congress with discretionary powers to
                    send delegates to such conventions, and that provision be made to defray the
                    expenses incident thereto.</p>
                <p>The difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of a judgment
                    and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted; but it is hoped and
                    believed that negotiations now in progress will result in the establishment of
                    the position which seems to this government so reasonable and just.</p>
                <p>I have already called the attention of Congress to the fact that in the ports of
                    Spain and its colonies onerous fines have lately been imposed upon vessels of
                    the United States for trivial technical offenses against local regulations.
                    Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far proved
                    unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>I regret to inform you also that the fees demanded by Spanish consuls in American
                    ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value of the cargo, as
                    to amount in effect to a considerable export duty, and that our remonstrances in
                    this regard have not as yet received the attention which they seem to
                    deserve.</p>
                <p>The German Government has invited the United States to participate in an
                    international exhibition of domestic cattle, to be held at Hamburg in July,
                    1883. If this country is to be represented, it is important that, in the early
                    days of this session, Congress should make a suitable appropriation for that
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>The death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that
                    government expressions of profound respect for his exalted character and for his
                    honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country. The Italian
                    Government has raised a question as to the propriety of recognizing in his dual
                    capacity the representative of this country recently accredited both as
                    secretary of legation and as consul-general at Rome. He has been received as
                    secretary, but his exequatur as consul-general has thus far been withheld.</p>
                <p>The extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation since 1874,
                    has been lately supplanted by another. The Senate has signified its approval,
                    and ratifications have been duly exchanged <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0023"
                    />between the contracting countries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been
                    added that of the assassination or attempted assassination of the chief of the
                    state.</p>
                <p>Negotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by treaty
                    of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiance and become
                    citizens of the United States without obtaining the consent of the Swiss
                    Government.</p>
                <p>I am glad to inform you that the immigration of paupers and criminals from
                    certain of the cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and is no longer
                    sanctioned by the authorities.</p>
                <p>The consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of August
                    3, 1882, which has for its object the return of foreign convicts to their own
                    country, should be so modified as not to be open to the interpretation that it
                    affects the extradition of criminals on preferred charges of crime.</p>
                <p>The Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the interpretation which this
                    government has put upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its jurisdictional rights
                    in Turkey. It may well be, however, that this difference will be adjusted by a
                    general revision of the system of jurisdiction of the United States in the
                    countries of the East—a subject to which your attention has been already called
                    by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>In the interest of justice towards China and Japan, I trust that the question of
                    the return of the indemnity fund to the governments of those countries will
                    reach, at the present session, the satisfactory solution which I have already
                    recommended, and which has recently been foreshadowed by Congressional
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>The treaty lately concluded with Corea awaits the action of the Senate.</p>
                <p>During the late disturbance in Egypt the timely presence of American vessels
                    served as a protection to the persons and property of many of our own citizens
                    and of citizens of other countries, whose governments have expressed their
                    thanks for this assistance.</p>
                <p>The recent legislation restricting immigration of laborers from China has given
                    rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from another country may
                    lawfully pass through our own.</p>
                <p>Construing the act of May 6, 1882, in connection with the treaty of November 7,
                    1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to
                    the United States as laborers, and would not forbid a mere transit across our
                    territory. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject for such action, if
                    any, as may be deemed advisable.</p>
                <p>This government has recently had occasion to manifest its interest in the
                    Republic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the boundary
                    dispute now pending between that republic and the British possession of Sierra
                    Leone.</p>
                <p>The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable after September 9,
                    1883, on twelve months’ notice by either party. While certain <pb n="VI"
                        xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0024"/>provisions of that compact may have proved
                    onerous, its existence has fostered commercial relations which it is important
                    to preserve. I suggest, therefore, that early consideration be given to such
                    modifications of the treaty as seem to be demanded by the interests of our
                    people.</p>
                <p>In view of our increasing trade with both Hayti and Santo Domingo I advise that
                    provision be made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter, by enlarging the
                    scope of the mission at Port au Prince.</p>
                <p>I regret that certain claims of American citizens against the Government of Hayti
                    have thus far been urged unavailingly.</p>
                <p>A recent agreement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier by the
                    armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile Indians. In my message of
                    last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness upon the borders and
                    to the necessity of legislation for its suppression. I again invite the
                    attention of Congress to the subject.</p>
                <p>A partial relief from these mischiefs has been sought in a convention, which now
                    awaits the approval of the Senate, as does also another touching the
                    establishment of the international boundary between the United States and
                    Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action of Congress will be required for
                    establishing suitable commissions of survey. The boundary dispute between Mexico
                    and Guatemala, which led this government to proffer its friendly counsels to
                    both parties, has been amicably settled.</p>
                <p>No change has occurred in our relations with Venezuela. I again invoke your
                    action in the matter of the pending awards against that republic to which
                    reference was made by a special message from the Executive at your last
                    session.</p>
                <p>An invitation has been received from the Government of Venezuela to send
                    representatives in July, 1883, to Caracas, for participating in the centennial
                    celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American independence.
                    In connection with this event it is designed to commence the erection at Caracas
                    of a statue of Washington, and to conduct an industrial exhibition which will be
                    open to American products. I recommend that the United States be represented,
                    and that suitable provision be made therefor.</p>
                <p>The elevation of the grade of our mission in Central America to the
                    plenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late session, has
                    been since effected.</p>
                <p>The war between Peru and Bolivia on the one side and Chili on the other began
                    more than three years ago. On the occupation by Chili in 1880 of all the
                    littoral territory of Bolivia, negotiations for peace were conducted under the
                    direction of the United States. The allies refused to concede any territory, but
                    Chili has since become master of the whole coast of both countries and of the
                    capital of Peru. A year since, as you have already been advised by
                    correspondence transmitted to you in January last, this government sent a
                    special mission to the belligerent powers to express the hope that Chili would
                    be disposed to <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0025"/>accept a money indemnity
                    for the expenses of the war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the
                    territory of her antagonist.</p>
                <p>This recommendation, which Chili declined to follow, this government did not
                    assume to enforce; nor can it be enforced without resort to measures which would
                    be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor with the spirit of our
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and, in the event
                    of our interference to dictate peace, would need to be supplemented by the
                    armies and navies of the United States. Such interference would almost
                    inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate—a result utterly at odds
                    with oar past policy, injurious to our present interests, and full of
                    embarrassments for the future.</p>
                <p>For effecting the termination of hostilities upon terms at once just to the
                    victorious nation and generous to its adversaries, this government has spared no
                    efforts save such as might involve the complications which I have indicated.</p>
                <p>It is greatly to be deplored that Chili seems resolved to exact such rigorous
                    conditions of peace and indisposed to submit to arbitration the terms of an
                    amicable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently
                    equitable and just to command the approval of other nations.</p>
                <p>About a year since, invitations were extended to the nations of this continent to
                    send representatives to a peace congress to assemble at Washington in November,
                    1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote, in the hope, as the
                    invitation itself declared, that in the mean time the disturbances between the
                    South American republics would be adjusted. As that expectation seemed unlikely
                    to be realized, I asked in April last for an expression of opinion from the two
                    houses of Congress as to the advisability of holding the proposed convention at
                    the time appointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature
                    reflection had suggested whether the diplomatic usage and traditions of the
                    government did not make it fitting that the Executive should consult the
                    representatives of the people before pursuing a line of policy somewhat novel in
                    its character, and far-reaching in its possible consequences. In view of the
                    fact that no action was taken by Congress in the premises and that no provision
                    had been made for necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the
                    convocation, and so notified the several governments which had been invited to
                    attend.</p>
                <p>I am unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my support of any
                    measures the wisdom of Congress may devise for the promotion of peace on this
                    continent and throughout the world, and I trust that the time is nigh when, with
                    the universal assent of civilized peoples, all international differences shall
                    be determined without resort to arms by the benignant processes of
                    arbitration.</p>
                <p>Changes have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several foreign powers
                    during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine <pb n="VIII"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0026"/>Republic, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Chili,
                    China, France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Russia have presented their
                    credentials. The missions of Denmark and Venezuela at this capital have been
                    raised in grade. Switzerland has created a plenipotentiary mission to this
                    government, and an embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Siam will shortly
                    arrive.</p>
                <p>Ourdiplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment of relations
                    with the new Kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mission to Siam, and by the
                    restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia has expressed his
                    gratification that a chargé d’affaires will shortly be sent to that country,
                    where the rights of our citizens have been hitherto courteously guarded by the
                    representatives of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>I renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the United States in
                    harmony with other maritime powers with respect to the international rules for
                    the prevention of collisions at sea.</p>
                <p>In conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of August last, I have
                    directed the Secretary of State to address foreign governments in respect to a
                    proposed conference for considering the subject of the universal adoption of a
                    common prime meridian to be used in the reckoning of longitude and in the
                    regulation of time throughout the civilized world. Their replies will, in due
                    time, be laid before you.</p>
                <p>An agreement was reached at Paris in 1875 between the principal powers for the
                    interchange of official publications through the medium of their respective
                    foreign departments.</p>
                <p>The admirable system which has been built up by the enterprise of the Smithsonian
                    Institution affords a practical basis for our co-operation in this scheme, and
                    an arrangement has been effected by which that institution will perform the
                    necessary labor, under the direction of the Department of State. A reasonable
                    compensation therefor should be provided by law.</p>
                <p>A clause in the act making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular service
                    contemplates the reorganization of both branches of such service on a salaried
                    basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit of the Treasury. I cordially favor
                    such a project, as likely to correct abuses in the present system. The Secretary
                    of State will present to you at an early day a plan for such reorganization.</p>
                <p>A full and interesting exhibit of the operations of the Treasury Department is
                    afforded by the report of the Secretary.</p>

                <p>During the year there have been organized 171 national banks, and of those
                    institutions there are now in operation 2,269, a larger number than ever before.
                    The value of their notes in active circulation on July 1, 1882, was
                    $324,656,458.</p>
                <p>I commend to your attention the Secretary’s views in respect to the likelihood of
                    a serious contraction of this circulation, and to the modes by which that result
                    may, in his judgment, be averted.</p>
                <p>In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and the retirement of silver
                    certificates I have seen nothing to alter but much to confirm the sentiments to
                    which I gave expression last year.</p>
                <p>A comparison between the respective amounts of silver dollar circulation on
                    November 1, 1881, and on November 1, 1882, shows a slight <pb n="XI"
                        xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0029"/>increase of a million and a half of dollars. But
                    during the interval there had been in the whole number coined an increase of
                    twenty-six millions. Of the one hundred and twenty-eight millions thus far
                    minted, little more than thirty-five millions are in circulation. The mass of
                    accumulated coin has grown so great that the vault room at present available for
                    storage is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not apparent why it is
                    desirable to continue this coinage, now so enormously in excess of the public
                    demand.</p>
                <p>As to the silver certificates, in addition to the grounds which seemed last year
                    to justify their retirement may be mentioned the effect which is likely to ensue
                    from the supply of gold certificates, for whose issuance Congress recently made
                    provision, and which are now in active circulation.</p>
                <p>You cannot fail to note with interest the discussion by the Secretary as to the
                    necessity of providing by legislation some mode of freeing the Treasury of an
                    excess of assets, in the event that Congress fails to reach an early agreement
                    for the reduction of taxation.</p>
                <p>I heartily approve the Secretary’s recommendation of immediate and extensive
                    reductions in the annual revenues of the government.</p>
                <p>It will be remembered that I urged upon the attention of Congress at its last
                    session the importance of relieving the industry and enterprise of the country
                    from the pressure of unnecessary taxation. It is one of the tritest maxims of
                    political economy that all taxes are burdensome, however wisely and prudently
                    imposed. And though there have always been among our people wide differences of
                    sentiment as to the best methods of raising the national revenues, and, indeed,
                    as to the principles upon which taxation should be based, there has been
                    substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied as
                    are necessary for a wise and economical administration of the government. Of
                    late the public revenues have far exceeded that limit, and unless checked by
                    appropriate legislation such excess will continue to increase from year to year.
                    For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1881, the surplus revenue amounted to one
                    hundred millions of dollars; for the fiscal year ended on the 30th of June last
                    the surplus was more than one hundred and forty-five millions.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of these moneys.
                    They have not only answered the requirements of the sinking fund, but have
                    afforded a large balance applicable to other reductions of the public debt.</p>
                <p>But I renew the expression of my conviction that such rapid extinguishment of the
                    national indebtedness as is now taking place is by no means a cause for
                    congratulation; it is a cause rather for serious apprehension.</p>
                <p>If it continues, it must speedily be followed by one of the evil results so
                    clearly set forth in the report of the Secretary.</p>
                <p>Either the surplus must lie idle in the Treasury, or the government <pb n="XII"
                        xml:id="pg_XII" facs="0030"/>will be forced to buy, at market rates, its
                    bonds not then redeemable, and which, under such circumstances, cannot fail to
                    command an enormous premium, or the swollen revenues will be devoted to
                    extravagant expenditure, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of an
                    overflowing treasury.</p>
                <p>It was made apparent in the course of the animated discussions which this
                    question aroused at the last session of Congress that the policy of diminishing
                    the revenue by reducing taxation commanded the general approval of the members
                    of both houses.</p>
                <p>I regret that because of conflicting views as to the best methods by which that
                    policy should be made operative none of its benefits have as yet been
                    reaped.</p>
                <p>In fulfillment of what I deem my constitutional duty, but with little hope that I
                    can make valuable contribution to this vexed question, I shall proceed to
                    intimate briefly my own views in relation to it.</p>
                <p>Upon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last fiscal year,
                    I felt justified in recommending to Congress the abolition of all
                    internal-revenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various forms and upon
                    distilled spirits and fermented liquors; and except also the special tax upon
                    the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles.</p>
                <p>I venture now to suggest that, unless it shall be ascertained that the probable
                    expenditures of the government for the coming year have been underestimated, all
                    internal taxes, save those which relate to distilled spirits, can be prudently
                    abrogated.</p>
                <p>Such a course, if accompanied by a simplification of the machinery of collection,
                    which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be expected to
                    result in diminishing the cost of such collection by at least two millions and a
                    half of dollars, and in the retirement from office of from fifteen hundred to
                    two thousand persons.</p>
                <p>The system of excise duties has never commended itself to the favor of the
                    American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying
                    deficiencies in the Treasury when, by reason of special exigencies, the duties
                    on imports have proved inadequate for the needs of the government. The sentiment
                    of the country doubtless demands that the present excise tax shall be abolished
                    as soon as such a course can be safely pursued.</p>
                <p>It seems to me, however, that, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure as the
                    total abolition of internal taxes would for the present be an unwise step.</p>
                <p>Two of these reasons are deserving of special mention: <list>
                        <item>First, it is by no means clear that even if the existing system of
                            duties on imports is continued without modification, those duties alone
                            will yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of the government. It is
                            estimated that one hundred millions of dollars will be required for
                            pensions during the coming year, and it may well be doubted whether the
                            maximum annual demand for that object has yet been reached.<pb n="XIII"
                                xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0031"/>Uncertainty upon this question would
                            alone justify, in my judgment, the retention for the present of that
                            portion of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable
                            to the people.</item>
                        <item>Second, a total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably
                            prove a serious if not an insurmountable obstacle to a thorough revision
                            of the tariff and to any considerable reduction in import duties.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>The present tariff system is in many respects unjust. It makes unequal
                    distributions both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was practically
                    recognized by a majority of each house of Congress in the passage of the act
                    creating the Tariff Commission. The report of that commission will be placed
                    before you at the beginning of this session, and will, I trust, afford you such
                    information as to the condition and prospects of the various commercial,
                    agricultural, manufacturing, mining, and other interests of the country and
                    contain such suggestions for statutory revision as will practically aid your
                    action upon this important subject.</p>
                <p>The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, amounted to
                    $137,000,000.</p>
                <p>It has in the three succeeding years reached, first, $186,000,000; then,
                    $198,000,000; and finally, as has been already stated, $220,000,000.</p>
                <p>The income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on June 30, 1883,
                    will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last mentioned.</p>
                <p>If the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain therefore that
                    large reductions from the customs revenue are entirely feasible. While
                    recommending this reduction I am far from advising the abandonment of the policy
                    of so discriminating in the adjustment of details as to afford aid and
                    protection to domestic labor. But the present system should be so revised as to
                    equalize the public burden among all classes and occupations, and bring it into
                    closer harmony with the present needs of industry.</p>
                <p>Without entering into minute detail, which, under present circumstances, is quite
                    unnecessary, I recommend an enlargement of the free list so as to include within
                    it the numerous articles which yield inconsiderable revenue, a simplification of
                    the complex and inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures,
                    particularly those of cotton, iron, and steel, and a substantial reduction of
                    the duties upon those articles, and upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool, and woolen
                    goods.</p>
                <p>If a general revision of the tariff shall be found to be impracticable at this
                    session, I express the hope that at least some of the more conspicuous
                    inequalities of the present law may be corrected before your final adjournment.
                    One of them is specially referred to by the Secretary. In view of a recent
                    decision of the Supreme Court, the necessity of amending the law by which the
                    Dutch standard of color is adopted as the test of the saccharine strength of
                    sugars is too obvious to require comment.</p>
                <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0032"/>
                <p>From the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the only outbreaks of
                    Indians during the past year occurred in Arizona and in the southwestern part of
                    New Mexico. They were promptly quelled, and the quiet which has prevailed in all
                    other parts of the country has permitted such an addition to be made to the
                    military force in the region endangered by the Apaches that there is little
                    reason to apprehend trouble in the future.</p>
                <p>Those parts of the Secretary’s report which relate to our sea-coast defenses and
                    their armament suggest the gravest reflections. Our existing fortifications are
                    notoriously inadequate to the defense of the great harbors and cities for whose
                    protection they were built.</p>
                <p>The question of providing an armament suited to our present necessities has been
                    the subject of consideration by a board, whose report was transmitted to
                    Congress at the last session. Pending the consideration of that report, the War
                    Department has taken no steps for the manufacture or conversion of any heavy
                    cannon, but the Secretary expresses the hope that authority and means to begin
                    that important work will be soon provided. I invite the attention of Congress to
                    the propriety of making more adequate provision for arming and equipping the
                    militia than is afforded by the act of 1808, which is still upon the
                    statute-book. The matter has already been the subject of discussion in the
                    Senate, and a bill which seeks to supply the deficiencies of existing laws is
                    now upon its calendar.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of War calls attention to an embarrassment growing out of the
                    recent act of Congress making the retirement of officers of the Army compulsory
                    at the age of sixty-four. The act of 1878 is still in force, which limits to
                    four hundred the number of those who can be retired for disability or upon their
                    own application. The two acts, when construed together, seem to forbid the
                    relieving, even for absolute incapacity, of officers who do not fall within the
                    purview of the later statute, save at such times as there chance to be less than
                    four hundred names on the retired list. There are now four hundred and twenty.
                    It is not likely that Congress intended this result, and I concur with the
                    Secretary, that the law ought to be amended.</p>
                <p>The grounds that impelled me to withhold my signature from the bill entitled “An
                    act making appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of
                    certain works on rivers and harbors,” which became a law near the close of your
                    last session, prompt me to express the hope that no similar measure will be
                    deemed necessary during the present session of Congress. Indeed, such a measure
                    would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately
                    urged upon your attention. I am informed by the Secretary of War that the
                    greater portion of the sum appropriated for the various items specified in that
                    act remains unexpended.</p>
                <p>Of the new works which it authorized, expenses have been incurred <pb n="XV"
                        xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0033"/>upon two only, for which the total appropriation
                    was $210,000. The present available balance is disclosed by the following table:

                    </table></p>
                <p>It is apparent by this exhibit that, so far as concerns most of the items to
                    which the act of August 2, 1882, relates, there can be no need of further
                    appropriations until after the close of the present session. If, however, any
                    action should seem to be necessary in respect to particular objects, it will be
                    entirely feasible to provide for those objects by appropriate legislation. It is
                    possible, for example, that a delay until the assembling of the next Congress to
                    make additional provision for the Mississippi River improvements might be
                    attended with serious consequences. If such should appear to be the case, a just
                    bill relating to that subject would command my approval.</p>
                <p>This leads me to offer a suggestion which I trust will commend itself to the
                    wisdom of Congress. Is it not advisable that grants of considerable sums of
                    money for diverse and independent schemes of internal improvement should be made
                    the subjects of separate and distinct legislative enactments? It will scarcely
                    be gainsaid, even by those who favor the most liberal expenditures for such
                    purposes as are sought to be accomplished by what is commonly called the river
                    and harbor bill, that the practice of grouping in such a bill appropriations for
                    a great diversity of objects, widely separated, either in their nature or in the
                    locality with which they are concerned, or in both, is one which is much to be
                    deprecated unless it is irremediable. It inevitably tends to secure the success
                    of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if separately considered,
                    could scarcely fail of rejection. By the adoption of the course I have
                    recommended, every member of Congress, whenever opportunity should arise for
                    giving his influence and vote for meritorious appropriations, would be enabled
                    so to do without being called upon to sanction others undeserving his approval.
                    So also would the Executive be afforded thereby full opportunity to exercise his
                    constitutional prerogative of opposing whatever appropriations seemed to him
                    objectionable, without imperiling the success of others which commended
                    themselves to his judgment.</p>
                <p>It may be urged in opposition to these suggestions that the number of works of
                    internal improvement which are justly entitled to governmental <pb n="XVI"
                        xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0034"/>aid is so great as to render impracticable
                    separate appropriation bills therefor, or even for such comparatively limited
                    number as make disposition of large sums of money. This objection may be well
                    founded, and, whether it be or not, the advantages which would be likely to
                    ensue from the adoption of the course I have recommended may perhaps be more
                    effectually attained by another, which I respectfully submit to Congress as an
                    alternative proposition.</p>
                <p>It is provided by the constitutions of fourteen of our States that the Executive
                    may disapprove any item or items of a bill appropriating money; whereupon the
                    part of the bill approved shall be law, and the part disapproved shall fail to
                    become law, unless repassed according to the provisions prescribed for the
                    passage of bills over the veto of the Executive. The States wherein some such
                    provision as the foregoing is a part of the fundamental law are, Alabama,
                    California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri,
                    Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia. I
                    commend to your careful consideration the question whether an amendment of the
                    Federal Constitution in the particular indicated would not afford the best
                    remedy for what is often a grave embarrassment both to members of Congress and
                    to the Executive, and is sometimes a serious public mischief.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy states the movements of the various
                    squadrons during the year, in home and foreign waters, where our officers and
                    seamen, with such ships as we possess, have continued to illustrate the high
                    character and excellent discipline of the naval organization.</p>
                <p>On the 21st of December, 1881, information was received that the exploring
                    steamer Jeannette had been crushed and abandoned in the Arctic Ocean. The
                    officers and crew, after a journey over the ice, embarked in three boats for the
                    coast of Siberia. One of the parties, under the command of Chief Engineer George
                    W. Melville, reached the land, and, falling in with the natives, was saved.
                    Another, under Lieutenant-Commander De Long, landed in a barren region near the
                    mouth of the Lena River. After six weeks had elapsed all but two of the number
                    had died from fatigue and starvation. No tidings have been received from the
                    party in the third boat, under the command of Lieutenant Chipp, but a long and
                    fruitless investigation leaves little doubt that all its members perished at
                    sea. As a slight tribute to their heroism I give in this communication the names
                    of the gallant men who sacrificed their lives on this expedition:
                    Lieutenant-Commander George W. De Long, Surgeon James M. Ambler, Jerome J.
                    Collins, Hans Halmer Erichsen, Heinrich H. Kaacke, George W. Boyd, Walter Lee,
                    Adolph Dressler, Carl A. Görtz, Nelse Iverson, the cook Ah Sam, and the Indian
                    Alexy. The officers and men in the missing boat were Lieutenant Charles W.
                    Chipp, commanding; William Dunbar, Alfred Sweetman, Walter Sharveil, <pb
                        n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0035"/>Albert C. Kuehne, Edward Star, Henry
                    D. Warren, and Peter E. Johnson.</p>
                <p>Lieutenant Giles B. Harber and Master William H. Scheutze are now bringing home
                    the remains of Lieutenant De Long and his comrades, in pursuance of the
                    directions of Congress.</p>
                <p>The Rodgers, fitted out for the relief of the Jeannette, in accordance with the
                    act of Congress of March 3, 1881, sailed from San Francisco June 16, under the
                    command of Lieutenant Robert M. Berry. On November 30 she was accidentally
                    destroyed by fire, while in winter quarters in Saint Lawrence Bay, but the
                    officers and crew succeeded in escaping to the shore. Lieutenant Berry and one
                    of his officers, after making a search for the Jeannette along the coast of
                    Siberia, fell in with Chief Engineer Melville’s party, and returned home by way
                    of Europe. The other officers and the crew of the Rodgers were brought from
                    Saint Lawrence Bay by the whaling steamer North Star. Master Charles F. Putnam,
                    who had been placed in charge of a depot of supplies at Cape Serdze, returning
                    to his post from Saint Lawrence Bay across the ice in a blinding snowstorm, was
                    carried out to sea and lost, notwithstanding all efforts to rescue him.</p>
                <p>It appears by the Secretary’s report that the available naval force of the United
                    States consists of thirty-seven cruisers, fourteen single-turreted monitors,
                    built during the rebellion, a large number of smoothbore guns and Parrott
                    rifles, and eighty-seven rifled cannon.</p>
                <p>The cruising vessels should be gradually replaced by iron or steel ships, the
                    monitors by modern armored vessels, and the armament by high-power rifled
                    guns.</p>
                <p>The reconstruction of our Navy, which was recommended in my last message, was
                    begun by Congress authorizing, in its recent act, the construction of two large
                    unarmored steel vessels of the character recommended by the late Naval Advisory
                    Board, and subject to the final approval of a new advisory board to be organized
                    as provided by that act. I call your attention to the recommendation of the
                    Secretary and the board, that authority be given to construct two more cruisers
                    of smaller dimensions, and one fleet dispatch vessel, and that appropriations be
                    made for high-power rifled cannon, for the torpedo service, and for other harbor
                    defenses.</p>
                <p>Pending the consideration by Congress of the policy to be hereafter adopted in
                    conducting the eight large navy-yards and their expensive establishments, the
                    Secretary advocates the reduction of expenditures therefor to the lowest
                    possible amounts.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of affording the officers and seamen of the Navy opportunities
                    for exercise and discipline in their profession, under appropriate control and
                    direction, the Secretary advises that the Light-House Service and Coast Survey
                    be transferred, as now organized, from the Treasury to the Navy Department; and
                    he also suggests, for the reasons which he assigns, that a similar transfer may
                    wisely be made of the cruising revenue vessels.</p>
                <pb n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII" facs="0036"/>
                <p>The Secretary forcibly depicts the intimate connection and interdependence of the
                    Navy and the commercial marine, and invites attention to the continued decadence
                    of the latter and the corresponding transfer of our growing commerce to foreign
                    bottoms.</p>
                <p>This subject is one of the utmost importance to the national welfare. Methods of
                    reviving American ship-building and of restoring the United States flag in the
                    ocean carrying trade should receive the immediate attention of Congress. We have
                    mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of modern iron
                    steamships in fair competition with our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage in
                    building ships is the greater cost of labor, and in sailing them, higher taxes
                    and greater interest on capital, while the ocean highways are already
                    monopolized by our formidable competitors. These obstacles should in some way be
                    overcome, and for our rapid communication with foreign lands we should not
                    continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in the yards of other countries and
                    sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamers on the principal
                    ocean lines or in any foreign ports, our facilities for extending our commerce
                    are greatly restricted, while the nations which build and sail the ships and
                    carry the mails and passengers obtain thereby conspicuous advantages in
                    increasing their trade.</p>
                <p>The report of the Postmaster-General gives evidence of the satisfactory condition
                    of that department, and contains many valuable data and accompanying suggestions
                    which cannot fail to be of interest.</p>
                <p>The information which it affords that the receipts for the fiscal year have
                    exceeded the expenditures must be very gratifying to Congress and to the people
                    of the country.</p>
                <p>As matters which may fairly claim particular attention, I refer you to his
                    observations in reference to the advisability of changing the present basis for
                    fixing salaries and allowances, of extending the money-order system, and of
                    enlarging the functions of the postal establishment so as to put under its
                    control the telegraph system of the country, though from this last and most
                    important recommendation I must withhold my concurrence.</p>
                <p>At the last session of Congress several bills were introduced into the House of
                    Representatives for the reduction of letter postage to the rate of two cents per
                    half ounce.</p>
                <p>I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly
                    persuaded that such a reduction would be for the best interests of the
                    public.</p>
                <p>It has been the policy of the government from its foundation to defray, as far as
                    possible, the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of
                    postage. It has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be
                    productive of a net revenue.</p>
                <p>As has been stated already, the report of the Postmaster General shows that there
                    is now a very considerable surplus in his department, <pb n="XIX"
                        xml:id="pg_XIX" facs="0037"/>and that henceforth the receipts are likely to
                    increase at a much greater ratio than the necessary expenditures. Unless some
                    change is made in the existing laws the profits of the postal service will in a
                    very few years swell the revenues of the government many millions of dollars.
                    The time seems auspicious, therefore, for some reduction in the rates of
                    postage. In what shall that reduction consist?</p>
                <p>A review of the legislation which has been had upon this subject during the last
                    thirty years discloses that domestic letters constitute the only class of mail
                    matter which has never been favored by a substantial reduction of rates. I am
                    convinced that the burden of maintaining the service falls most unequally upon
                    that class, and that more than any other it is entitled to present relief.</p>
                <p>That such relief may be extended without detriment to other public interests will
                    be discovered upon reviewing the results of former reductions.</p>
                <p>Immediately prior to the act of 1845, the postage upon a letter composed of a
                    single sheet was as follows: <table rows="6" cols="2">
                        <row>
                            <cell>If conveyed</cell>
                            <cell>Cents.</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                            <cell>30 miles or less</cell>
                            <cell role="num">6</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                            <cell>Between 30 and 80 miles</cell>
                            <cell role="num">10</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                            <cell>Between 80 and150 miles</cell>
                            <cell role="num">12½</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                            <cell>Between 150 and 400 miles</cell>
                            <cell role="num">18¾</cell>
                        </row>
                        <row>
                            <cell>Over 400 miles</cell>
                            <cell role="num">25</cell>
                        </row>
                    </table></p>
                <p>By the act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter conveyed for any distance
                    under 300 miles was fixed at five cents, and for any greater distance at ten
                    cents.</p>
                <p>By the act of 1851 it was provided that a single letter, if prepaid, should be
                    carried any distance not exceeding three thousand miles for three cents and any
                    greater distance for six cents.</p>
                <p>It will be noticed that both of these reductions were of a radical character and
                    relatively quite as important as that which is now proposed.</p>
                <p>In each case there ensued a temporary loss of revenue, but a sudden and large
                    influx of business, which substantially repaired that loss within three
                    years.</p>
                <p>Unless the experience of past legislation in this country and elsewhere goes for
                    naught, it may be safely predicted that the stimulus of 33⅓ per centum reduction
                    in the tax for carriage would at once increase the number of letters consigned
                    to the mails.</p>
                <p>The advantages of secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of sealed
                    packets for postal cards and open circulars, and in divers other ways the volume
                    of first-class matter would be enormously augmented. Such increase amounted in
                    England, in the first year after the adoption of penny postage, to more than 125
                    per cent.</p>
                <p>As a result of careful estimates, the details of which cannot be here set out, I
                    have become convinced that the deficiency for the first year <pb n="XX"
                        xml:id="pg_XX" facs="0038"/>after the proposed reduction would not exceed 7
                    per cent. of the expenditures, or $3,000,000, while the deficiency after the
                    reduction of 1845 was more than 14 per cent., and after that of 1851 was 27 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>Another interesting comparison is afforded by statistics furnished me by the
                    Post-Office Department.</p>
                <p>The act of 1845 was passed in face of the fact that there existed a deficiency of
                    more than $30,000. That of 1851 was encouraged by the slight surplus of
                    $132,000. The excess of revenue in the next fiscal year is likely to be
                    $3,500,000.</p>
                <p>If Congress should approve these suggestions it may be deemed desirable to supply
                    to some extent the deficiency which must for a time result, by increasing the
                    charge for carrying merchandise, which is now only sixteen cents per pound. But
                    even without such an increase I am confident that the receipts under the
                    diminished rates would equal the expenditures after the lapse of three or four
                    years.</p>
                <p>The report of the Department of Justice brings anew to your notice the necessity
                    of enlarging the present system of Federal jurisprudence so as effectually to
                    answer the requirements of the ever-increasing litigation with which it is
                    called upon to deal.</p>
                <p>The Attorney-General renews the suggestions of his predecessor that in the
                    interests of justice better provision than the existing laws afford should be
                    made in certain judicial districts for fixing the fees of witnesses and
                    jurors.</p>
                <p>In my message of December last I referred to pending criminal proceedings growing
                    out of alleged frauds in what is known as the star-route service of the
                    Post-Office Department, and advised you that I had enjoined upon the
                    Attorney-General and associate counsel, to whom the interests of the government
                    were intrusted, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of the law all
                    persons who might be found chargeable with those offenses. A trial of one of
                    these cases has since occurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the
                    supreme court of this District, and was conducted with great zeal and ability.
                    It resulted in a disagreement of the jury, but the cause has been again placed
                    upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty persons shall
                    finally escape punishment for their offenses it will not be for lack of diligent
                    and earnest efforts, on the part of the prosecution.</p>
                <p>I trust that some agreement may be reached which will speedily enable Congress,
                    with the concurrence of the Executive, to afford the commercial community the
                    benefits of a national bankrupt law.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with its accompanying documents,
                    presents a full statement of the varied operations of that department. In
                    respect to Indian affairs nothing has occurred which has changed or seriously
                    modified the views to which I devoted much space in a former communication to
                    Congress. I renew the recommendations therein contained as to extending to the
                    Indian the protection of the law, allotting land in severalty to such as desire
                    it, and making <pb n="XXI" xml:id="pg_XXI" facs="0039"/>suitable provision for
                    the education of youth. Such provision, as the Secretary forcibly maintains,
                    will prove unavailing unless it is broad enough to include all those who are
                    able and willing to make use of it, and should not solely relate to intellectual
                    training, but also to instruction in such manual labor and simple industrial
                    arts as can be made practically available.</p>
                <p>Among other important subjects which are included within the Secretary’s report,
                    and which will doubtless furnish occasion for Congressional action, may be
                    mentioned the neglect of the railroad companies to which large grants of land
                    were made by the acts of 1862 and 1864 to take title thereto, and their
                    consequent inequitable exemption from local taxation.</p>
                <p>No survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral
                    and intellectual progress of the people.</p>
                <p>The Census returns disclose an alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions
                    of the country where the provision for schools is grossly inadequate. It is a
                    momentous question for the decision of Congress whether immediate and
                    substantial aid should not be extended by the general government for
                    supplementing the efforts of private beneficence and of State and Territorial
                    legislation in behalf of education.</p>
                <p>The regulation of inter-state commerce has already been the subject of your
                    deliberations. One of the incidents of the marvelous extension of the railway
                    system of the country has been the adoption of such measures by the corporations
                    which own or control the roads as has tended to impair the advantages of
                    healthful competition and to make hurtful discriminations in the adjustment of
                    freightage.</p>
                <p>These inequalities have been corrected in several of the States by appropriate
                    legislation, the effect of which is necessarily restricted to the limits of
                    their own territory.</p>
                <p>So far as such mischiefs affect commerce between the States, or between any one
                    of the States and a foreign country, they are subjects of national concern, and
                    Congress alone can afford relief.</p>
                <p>The results which have thus far attended the enforcement of the recent statute
                    for the suppression of polygamy in the Territories are reported by the Secretary
                    of the Interior. It is not probable that any additional legislation in this
                    regard will be deemed desirable until the effect of existing laws shall be more
                    closely observed and studied.</p>
                <p>I congratulate you that the commissioners under whose supervision those laws have
                    been put in operation are encouraged to believe that the evil at which they are
                    aimed may be suppressed without resort to such radical measures as in some
                    quarters have been thought indispensable for success.</p>
                <p>The close relation of the general government to the Territories preparing to be
                    great States may well engage your special attention. It is there that the Indian
                    disturbances mainly occur and that polygamy has found room for its growth. I
                    cannot doubt that a careful survey <pb n="XXII" xml:id="pg_XXII" facs="0040"/>of
                    Territorial legislation would be of the highest utility. Life and property would
                    become more secure. The liability of outbreaks between Indians and whites would
                    be lessened. The public domain would be more securely guarded and better
                    progress be made in the instruction of the young.</p>
                <p>Alaska is still without any form of civil government. If means were provided for
                    the education of its people and for the protection of their lives and property
                    the immense resources of the region would invite permanent settlements and open
                    new fields for industry and enterprise.</p>
                <p>The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture presents an account of the labors
                    of that department during the past year, and includes information of much
                    interest to the general public.</p>
                <p>The condition of the forests of the country and the wasteful manner in which
                    their destruction is taking place give cause for serious apprehension. Their
                    action in protecting the earth’s surface, in modifying the extremes of climate,
                    and in regulating and sustaining the flow of springs and streams is now well
                    understood, and their importance in relation to the growth and prosperity of the
                    country cannot be safely disregarded. They are fast disappearing before
                    destructive fires and the legitimate requirements of our increasing population,
                    and their total extinction cannot be long delayed unless better methods than now
                    prevail shall be adopted for their protection and cultivation. The attention of
                    Congress is invited to the necessity of additional legislation to secure the
                    preservation of the valuable forests still remaining on the public domain,
                    especially in the extreme Western States and Territories, where the necessity
                    for their preservation is greater than in less mountainous regions, and where
                    the prevailing dryness of the climate renders their restoration, if they are
                    once destroyed, well nigh impossible.</p>
                <p>The communication which I made to Congress at its first session in December last
                    contained a somewhat full statement of my sentiments in relation to the
                    principles and rules which ought to govern appointments to public service.</p>
                <p>Referring to the various plans which had theretofore been the subject of
                    discussion in the National Legislature (plans which in the main were modeled
                    upon the system which obtains in Great Britain, but which lacked certain of the
                    prominent features whereby that system is distinguished), I felt bound to
                    intimate my doubts whether they, or any of them, would afford adequate remedy
                    for the evils which they aimed to correct.</p>
                <p>I declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed measures should prove acceptable
                    to Congress, they would receive the unhesitating support of the Executive.</p>
                <p>Since these suggestions were submitted for your consideration there has been no
                    legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has meanwhile been
                    an increase in the public interest in that subject, and the people of the
                    country, apparently without distinction of party, <pb n="XXIII"
                        xml:id="pg_XXIII" facs="0041"/>have in various ways, and upon frequent
                    occasions, given expression to their earnest wish for prompt and definite
                    action. In my judgment, such action should no longer be postponed.</p>
                <p>I may add that my own sense of its pressing importance has been quickened by
                    observation of a practical phase of the matter, to which attention has more than
                    once been called by my predecessors.</p>
                <p>The civil list now comprises about one hundred thousand persons, far the larger
                    part of whom must, under the terms of the Constitution, be selected by the
                    President either directly or through his own appointees.</p>
                <p>In the early years of the administration of the government, the personal
                    direction of appointments to the civil service may not have been an irksome task
                    for the Executive; but, now that the burden has increased fully a hundred-fold,
                    it has become greater than he ought to bear, and it necessarily diverts his time
                    and attention from the proper discharge of other duties no less delicate and
                    responsible, and which, in the very nature of things, cannot be delegated to
                    other hands.</p>
                <p>In the judgment of not a few who have given study and reflection to this matter,
                    the nation has outgrown the provisions which the Constitution has established
                    for filling the minor offices in the public service.</p>
                <p>But whatever may be thought of the wisdom or expediency of changing the
                    fundamental law in this regard, it is certain that much relief may be afforded,
                    not only to the President and to the heads of the departments, but to Senators
                    and Representatives in Congress, by discreet legislation. They would be
                    protected in a great measure by the bill now pending before the Senate, or by
                    any other which should embody its important features, from the pressure of
                    personal importunity and from the labor of examining conflicting claims and
                    pretensions of candidates.</p>
                <p>I trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be
                    taken for the correction of the evils which inhere in the present methods of
                    appointment, and I assure you of my hearty co-operation in any measures which
                    are likely to conduce to that end.</p>
                <p>As to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life-of the
                    subordinate employés of the government, it seems to be generally agreed that,
                    whatever their extent or character, the one should be definite and the other
                    stable, and that neither should be regulated by zeal in the service of party or
                    fidelity to the fortunes of an individual.</p>
                <p>It matters little to the people at large what competent person is at the head of
                    this department or of that bureau, if they feel assured that the removal of one
                    and the accession of another will not involve the retirement of honest and
                    faithful subordinates, whose duties are purely administrative and have no
                    legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principles or the
                    success of any political party or faction. It is to this latter class of
                    officers that the Senate bill, to which I have already referred, exclusively
                    applies.</p>
                <pb n="XXIV" xml:id="pg_XXIV" facs="0042"/>
                <p>While neither that bill nor any other prominent scheme for improving the civil
                    service concerns the higher grade of officials, who are appointed by the
                    President and confirmed by the Senate, I feel bound to correct a prevalent
                    misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present Executive has
                    displaced the incumbent of an office and appointed another in his stead.</p>
                <p>It has been repeatedly alleged that he has in this particular signally departed
                    from the course which has been pursued under recent administrations of the
                    government. The facts are as follows:</p>
                <p>The whole number of Executive appointments during the four years immediately
                    preceding Mr. Garfield’s accession to the Presidency was 2,696.</p>
                <p>Of this number 244, or 9 per cent., involved the removal of previous
                    incumbents.</p>
                <p>The ratio of removals to the whole number of appointments was much the same
                    during each of those four years.</p>
                <p>In the first year, with 790 appointments, there were 74 removals, or 9.3 per
                    cent.; in the second, with 917 appointments, there were 85 removals, or 8.5 per
                    cent.; in the third, with 480 appointments, there were 48 removals, or 10 per
                    cent.; in the fourth, with 429 appointments, there were 37 removals, or 8.6 per
                    cent. In the four months of President Garfield’s administration there were 390
                    appointments and 89 removals, or 22.7 per cent. Precisely the same number of
                    removals (89) has taken place in the fourteen months which have since elapsed,
                    but they constitute only 7.8 per cent, of the whole number of appointments
                    (1,118) within that period, and less than 2.6 of the entire list of officials
                    (3,459), exclusive of the Army and Navy, which is filled by Presidential
                    appointment.</p>
                <p>I declare my approval of such legislation as may be found necessary for
                    supplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political
                    assessments.</p>
                <p>In July last I authorized a public announcement that employés of the government
                    should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or
                    refusing to make political contributions, and that their action in that regard
                    would in no manner affect their official status.</p>
                <p>In this announcement I acted upon the view which I had always maintained and
                    still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any other
                    citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party
                    of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation
                    in fact, that by solicitation of official superiors and by other modes such
                    contributions have at times been obtained from persons whose only motive for
                    giving has been the fear of what might befall them if they refused. It goes
                    without saying that such contributions are not voluntary, and in my judgment
                    their collection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually
                    suppress them will receive my cordial approval.</p>
                <pb n="XXV" xml:id="pg_XXV" facs="0043"/>
                <p>I hope that however numerous and urgent may be the demands upon your attention,
                    the interests of this District will not be forgotten. The denial to its
                    residents of the great right of suffrage in all its relation to national, State,
                    and municipal action imposes upon Congress the duty of affording them the best
                    administration which its wisdom can devise.</p>
                <p>The report of the District Commissioners indicates certain measures whose
                    adoption would seem to be very desirable. I instance in particular those which
                    relate to arrears of taxes, to steam railroads, and to assessments of real
                    property.</p>
                <p>Among the questions which have been the topic of recent debate in the halls of
                    Congress none are of greater gravity than those relating to the ascertainment of
                    the vote for Presidential electors and the intendment of the Constitution in its
                    provisions for devolving Executive functions upon the Vice-President when the
                    President suffers from inability to discharge the powers and duties of his
                    office.</p>
                <p>I trust that no embarrassments may result from a failure to determine these
                    questions before another national election.</p>
                <p>The closing year has been replete with blessings for which we owe to the Giver of
                    all Good our reverent acknowledgment. For the uninterrupted harmony of our
                    foreign relations, for the decay of sectional animosities, for the exuberance of
                    our harvests and the triumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for
                    the prevalence of health, the spread of intelligence and the conservation of the
                    public credit, for the growth of the country in all the elements of national
                    greatness—for these and countless other blessings—we should rejoice and be glad.
                    I trust that, under the inspiration of this great prosperity, our counsels may
                    be harmonious, and that the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice, and
                    economy may lead to the adoption of measures in which the Congress and the
                    Executive may heartily unite.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. John S. Rowe, a native of this country,
                        born of English parents, having been cited by the authorities of the
                        province of Buenos Ayres to appear and enroll himself in the militia of the
                        province, and having failed to comply with the citation, was placed under
                        arrest, but given the liberty of the town, St. Vincent.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rowe telegraphed me informing of his arrest, and that he was a
                        naturalized citizen of the United States, and at the same time forwarded to
                        me his naturalization papers and a passport granted him by the Department of
                        State.</p>
                    <p>As soon as I received his papers, I had an interview with the minister of
                        foreign affairs at his private residence and requested Mr. Rowe’s release at
                        once, stating that if there could be any question as to Mr. Rowe’s
                        citizenship, that matter could be subsequently and amicably settled. The
                        minister at once directed a note to the governor and requested Mr. Rowe’s
                        immediate release, which was done.</p>
                    <p>It appears from Mr. Rowe’s statement, that in the year 1868 he arrived in the
                        United States, with no other object in view further than that of obtaining a
                        good general education.</p>
                    <p>From 1868 to 1875 he resided in the State of Ohio; during this time he went
                        through a regular course of study at Baldwin University, but a portion of
                        the time he was engaged in farming and in work as a carpenter.</p>
                    <p>In 1875, his health being poor, he returned to Buenos Ayres, where his
                        parents and relatives live. In 1876 he again went to the United States, and
                        married in Ohio, where he remained but a short time (a few months), his
                        health being yet poor. Requiring a warmer climate, he returned again
                        “temporarily” to the Argentine Republic, where he is now engaged at work
                        with a reaping machine.</p>
                    <p>It was during Mr. Rowe’s first visit to the United States that he received
                        his naturalization papers, and they appear to be regular.</p>
                    <p>The governor of this province has decided that Mr. Rowe is an ex-Argentine
                        citizen, on the ground, the constitution and law declare, that all persons
                        born on Argentine soil are Argentines.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the Argentine naturalization laws do not require a person
                        making application to become an Argentine citizen to renounce absolutely
                        allegiance to his sovereign, and he only remains an Argentine <pb n="2"
                            xml:id="pg_2" facs="0074"/>citizen so long as he remains on Argentine
                        soil or under Argentine jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>In a second interview with the minister of foreign affairs it was suggested
                        that, as the question had been raised, it was a matter of much importance
                        that the two governments should arrive, in a friendly way at an
                        understanding in reference to the regulations which should control in this
                        and like cases, and, in order that the present case might be properly
                        brought before us, that Mr. Rowe should first appeal to the federal judge
                        for a decision; which course was adopted, and the case is now before the
                        court.</p>
                    <p>I have not been able to obtain copies of our late treaties with Germany and
                        other powers in relation to naturalized citizens, and would be pleased to
                        receive them or any instructions which the department may see proper to
                        give.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 7th instant President Roca opened the
                        annual session of the Argentine Congress by reading his second annual
                        message in both houses, a printed copy (translated) of which I have the
                        honor to forward with this.</p>
                    <p>The President opened his message by referring to the progress and internal
                        peace of the country, which has not been disturbed during the past year, and
                        says the republic is beginning to be mistress of itself, and to feel less
                        uncertainty as to the future, and the confidence so inspired is spreading to
                        foreigners, and attracting the attention of capitalists, scientists, and
                        manufacturers of countries that have a plethora of population.</p>
                    <p>In reference to the subjects of immigration and colonization, he says that
                        the arrivals during last year reach 32,817 souls, and this increase in
                        population was spontaneous, and cost the nation nothing. Besides the
                        colonies in the provinces, there are eight colonies on national territory,
                        containing 9,370 settlers, with property valued at $1,977,774.</p>
                    <p>In referring to the subject of foreign relations, the President speaks of the
                        limits question with Chili, which had so much occupied the public mind, and
                        which had passed through so many changes, and very gracefully adverts to the
                        good influence of the American ministers here and in Chili in reopening
                        negotiations, and whose services continued until the question was finally
                        settled.</p>
                    <p>The message is well received, and the press of all parties admit that it is
                        clear and comprehensive, giving a fair and true statement of public affairs
                        throughout the Republic.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received and duly considered your
                        dispatch No. 350, of the 10th of February last, relative to the questioned
                        citizenship of Mr. John S. Rowe.</p>
                    <p>It seems that Mr. Rowe, an Argentine citizen by birth, having resided and
                        been naturalized in the United States, has been arrested for military duty
                        on his return to his native land; that on your representations he has been
                        released, and that proceedings before an Argentine tribunal, in the nature
                        of an appeal on Mr. Rowe’s part, are now pending.</p>
                    <p>You also represent the earnest desire of the Argentine minister of state to
                        reach a harmonious understanding with this government in the matter of
                        conflicting claims of citizenship under the organic laws of the two
                        countries, and you accordingly ask the instructions of the Department in the
                        premises, as well as copies of the late naturalization treaties of the
                        United States with foreign powers.</p>
                    <p>Responding to your specific request, I send you herewith a number of
                        naturalization treaties for your examination. I may add, however, that these
                        treaties do not <hi rend="italic">create</hi> rights for our naturalized
                        citizens returning to the land of their nativity; they simply recognize and
                        define the rights of expatriation, which we hold to be an inherent right of
                        all men.</p>
                    <p>Even in the absence of a specific treaty on the subject, this government
                        must, in consonance with the principle it uniformly follows, claim for a
                        duly naturalized citizen of the United States abroad all the rights which a
                        native American citizen would possess under like circumstances, save only in
                        the case of the performance by the naturalized citzen of some voluntary act
                        amounting to an intelligent relinquishment of his acquired citizenship and
                        resumption of his birth allegiance. If conflicts arise as to the status of
                        individuals, they are within the competence of diplomacy to arrange. It is,
                        therefore, regarded as somewhat unfortunate that you have consented, pending
                        the needful diplomatic discussion of Rowe’s case, to refer to the Argentine
                        courts the question of his military allegiance to the Argentine
                        Republic.</p>
                    <p>As the case now stands, we should with difficulty assent to the pretension
                        that an American citizen, returning in good faith and honesty to the land of
                        his original allegiance, and relying on the power of his government to
                        protect his acquired rights there as elsewhere, may be surprised by an
                        announcement, judicial or otherwise, that by the mere act of return, and
                        without intention on his part so to do, he ceases to be an American
                        citizen.</p>
                    <p>If, under cover of a judicial decision, the Argentine Government should
                        insist on its claim that Rowe’s return to Argentine jurisdiction annuls the
                        rights he has acquired here, we shall expect and insist that he shall be
                        given notice of this, and allowed a reasonable time to quit the country if
                        he has not the intention of resuming his original allegiance. This
                        expectation is not an innovation. Its principle is found in the greater
                        number of modern treaties of extradition, where, in case of fresh
                        proceedings against a surrendered criminal tor offenses other than those for
                        which he was extradited or condemned, it is provided that he shall first be
                        allowed one month in which to leave the country. It is certainly not
                        unreasonable to expect that a peaceful and reputable citizen should be
                        allowed at least equal consideration with a convicted criminal.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0076"/>
                    <p>In other words, we can only assent to recognize as valid and in accordance
                        with the principles of human rights and international jurisprudence a
                        voluntary and intelligent resumption of Argentine citizenship on the part of
                        Rowe or any other American citizen so situated, and not a surprised and
                        enforced submission.</p>
                    <p>You will submit these views to the minister of foreign relations, saying
                        that, in view of his expressed desire for a conciliatory good understanding
                        in the premises, it is not doubted that the ground held by this government
                        will commend itself to him as one which he would desire, in return, to see
                        govern the personal status of an American naturalized in the Argentine
                        Republic and returning to the United States on innocent business.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The President, through the medium of your
                        legation, in November last, extended to the government of the Argentine
                        Republic an invitation to be represented at a congress of American States
                        which it was proposed to hold in Washington on the 22d day of November next,
                        for the purpose of considering questions connected with the preservation of
                        peace on the American continent, and it is presumed that you have, in
                        compliance with the Department’s instructions, communicated the invitation
                        to the Argentine Government.</p>
                    <p>At the time that proposal was put forth, the President expressed the fervent
                        hope that by the date fixed for the meeting of the congress the questions
                        now dividing some of the republics of the southern continent would have
                        disappeared, and that the representatives of the several commonwealths could
                        meet with freedom to discuss the future aspects of the question, unaffected
                        by any existing national difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The President, however, now directs me to instruct you to inform the
                        government of the Argentine Republic that inasmuch as that peaceful
                        condition of the South American republics which was contemplated as
                        essential to a profitable and harmonious assembling of the Congress does not
                        exist, and he having, besides, on the 18th day of April, 1882, submitted the
                        proposition to Congress without evoking an expression of its views on the
                        subject, and no provision having been made by it for such a Congress, he is
                        constrained to postpone the projected meeting until some future day.</p>
                    <p>While thus giving due notification to the friendly governments interested,
                        the President cannot but express his belief that the fact of such a congress
                        having been called has not been without benefit, it having directed the
                        attention of the people of the United States, as well as of the republics of
                        South America, to the importance of having a more defined policy, to be
                        satisfactory to all, governing the international relations of the
                        republics.</p>
                    <p>You will communicate this dispatch to the minister for foreign relations of
                        the Argentine Republic at an early day, by reading it to him, and, if he
                        shall so desire, leaving with him a copy of it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * With an earnest desire to find something
                        in my recent visit to the east which might be of real value to the
                        Department, I could find nothing which the resources of the press and the
                        vigilance of the local agents of the Department—who seem to stand at their
                        posts like sentries, with eager eye watching for every bit of
                        information—was not gathering.</p>
                    <p>But my own observation impressed me so strongly with the high favor in which
                        American men and American institutions are just now held among eastern
                        peoples, that I want to record my testimony, although only cumulative.</p>
                    <p>It would seem a great misfortune if American energy should be so exhausted in
                        the west as to neglect the flattering field thus opened to its trade in the
                        east. Rulers and subjects are united in the possession and expression of the
                        kindliest feeling towards us, and Americans may rely on receiving not only
                        the treatment accorded to the most favored nations, but even a better. I
                        think General Wallace, at Constantinople, and Mr. Wolf, at Cairo, would
                        corroborate my statement, that to-day, upon a proposition to the government
                        for a charter or concession, or to the average Turk or Egyptian for a
                        bargain, the American, both at court and in the market, would receive the
                        preference. Does not this open to us a field of profitable enterprise, the
                        limits of which can be found only in the resources of a people who begin to
                        appreciate, and are still lacking, all those conveniences which modern
                        invention has added to civilized life? And this appreciation of us and our
                        country, it must be remembered, is at a time when the United States can make
                        no display of those material resources which unduly, and, it has been
                        supposed, only affect the oriental imagination. The harbors of Alexandria,
                        Smyrna, and the Sea of Marmora see the great ships and hulking ironclads of
                        our rivals, but rarely any vessels of ours.</p>
                    <p>Two influences seem mainly to have produced this sentiment so strange and so
                        flattering. The education given by the American colleges and the characters
                        and influence of the American missionary is one. On the most conspicuous
                        site on the Bosphorus stands Robert College, and on a rocky point, seen by
                        the mariner long before the minarets and roofs of the surrounding city of
                        Beirut, stands the Syrian Protestant college. Both institutions are founded
                        by American munificence, and no youth who seeks here a liberal education
                        fails to recognize that the privileges of library, and dormitory, and
                        lecture-room, and class-room, and grounds, and hall, are the unselfish gift
                        of American philanthropy.</p>
                    <p>The college at Beirut, under the influence of a great demand, has gathered
                        round itself the ordinary departments of a university. These departments,
                        like the parent college, are housed in stone, and the stately <pb n="6"
                            xml:id="pg_6" facs="0078"/>structures suggest that the learning for
                        which they exist has come to stay. It is difficult to overestimate the
                        influence wielded by the lawyer, the doctor, the engineer, the teacher, the
                        scholar, who returns from these walls to his home in Bulgaria, Syria,
                        Arabia, and Egypt. He left it a poor native boy—he returns to wield the
                        power of education among the illiterate, and never fails gratefully to
                        remember and eloquently to tell a story so full of honor to America.</p>
                    <p>A second influence is the general impression, that all other nations have
                        only selfish objects in their intercourse with Turkey; they come because
                        they want something. On the other hand, the common talk in every Eastern
                        mouth was, “You Americans want nothing; you seek to give; you build our
                        colleges; you educate our youths; you seek no offices for your citizens; you
                        seek no share of our lands; you enforce the payment of no illegal debt.” And
                        these expressions so constantly heard, some in a rough way, the
                        opportunities for American influence in Turkey. The policy of our government
                        countenances no governmental interference. But that policy has taught the
                        American citizen everywhere to rely on himself. Is there any reason why the
                        American citizen should not here as an individual step in and establish a
                        trade and general commercial intercourse which would be most remunerative to
                        us and yet most useful to the Turks?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The diplomatic questions raised by the United
                        States in the matter of the extradition of the Collins brothers from Italy
                        to Belgium, and of their transfer from Belgium to a third country, have led
                        to a revision of the extradition treaty between Italy and Belgium of
                        1875.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to send herewith the text of the amendments now in full
                        force, and a translation of the same. I add, also, on page 4, the second
                        section of article 3 of treaty of 1875.</p>
                    <p>The treaty as amended allows the trial and punishment for crimes and offenses
                        other than that for which the party was extradited, with the consent of the
                        state that granted the extradition.</p>
                    <p>A not less important amendment is that which allows the state which gets
                        possession by extradition of an accused party to transfer him to a third
                        country by a second extradition, with like consent.</p>
                    <p>This is undoubtedly intended to prevent in the future the application of the
                        interpretation given by the United States to treaty of 1875, and which was
                        accepted by the Belgian Government in the Collins case.</p>

                        translation of the new proposed treaty between France and Belgium for the
                        protection of literary property, also of trade and commercial marks. It has
                        already been ratified by the Belgium Parliament. The French Government has
                        not as yet acted upon it, the time for exchange of treaties having been
                        extended to May 15 next.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In Belgium, as in France, dramatical and musical compositions and <pb n="8"
                            xml:id="pg_8" facs="0080"/>representations have a large place in the
                        popular entertainments, most of which are of French origin.</p>
                    <p>Protection of this class of French authors is a leading feature of the new
                        treaty. The last preceding (of 1861) provided that in the absence of a
                        contract establishing the terms upon which French dramatic and musical
                        compositions might be represented in Belgium, compensation for each
                        representation should be upon the basis of the following tariff: <table

                    <p>M. Cattreux, in his pamphlet, gives the following illustration of the
                        practical working of the tariff in connection with the Theâtre Monnaie of
                        Brussels, the principal opera house in Belgium.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To give a striking idea of the working of this provision at our principal
                            opera house to the prejudice of authors and dramatic composers, I will
                            instance one of the last series of representations given by Patti. She
                            appeared in Aida, Faust, Le Tronvère, La Traviata, Lucie, and Le
                            Barbier. The four first works only gave a remuneration of 18 francs for
                            the representations; that is, 9 francs for the composer and the same sum
                            for the librettists. The total receipts were 20,000 francs for each
                            representation, or 140,000 francs for the seven representations. All the
                            composers and authors, creators of the works interpreted by the singer,
                            have received altogether 72 francs; that is, 36 francs for the composers
                            and the same for all the librettists together.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The new treaty abolishes this tariff and makes the matter of compensation one
                        of contract with dramatic authors and composers.</p>
                    <p>The right of translation is reserved to the author by the new treaty for ten
                        years instead of five, and three years instead of three months are granted
                        for the first publication of a translation.</p>
                    <p>The minister of foreign affairs in his “Exposè des Motifs” recognizes the
                        fact that the new treaty will lessen the power of the Flemish theater to
                        draw from French sources, but finds compensation for their loss in the fact
                        that the Flemish element will be compelled to rely more upon original
                        Belgian productions, and so bring itself into closer sympathy with the
                        national spirit.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Belgian Parliament adjourned last week.
                        The election of the new Parliament, at which one-half the members of both
                        the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are to be chosen, takes place on the 13th
                        of June. The issue between the Liberal and Catholic parties, the only one
                        that seriously enters into the canvass, is the school law of 1879, which
                        entirely separates the church from the state, so far as its official
                        relations with the state schools are concerned.</p>
                    <p>The public feeling over this question is as intense as was the feeling in the
                        United States over the slavery issues in 1860. In my dispatch No. 51 I had
                        the honor to present the attitude of parties toward the new school law and
                        the methods adopted by the church authorities to compel its communion to
                        send their children to the church schools, which have been established
                        throughout the kingdom since the passage of the law of 1879.</p>
                    <p>I gave the following extract from a mandate of the bishops, indicating to
                        their clergy the coercive measures to be adopted:</p>
                    <p>The holy communion, must he publicly refused— <list>
                            <label>1st.</label>
                            <item>To instructors who, without special license or dispensation,
                                exercise their functions in an official school.</item>
                            <label>2d.</label>
                            <item>To active members who serve upon the school committees.</item>
                            <label>3d.</label>
                            <item>To school inspectors, principal or cantonal.</item>
                            <label>4th.</label>
                            <item>To all persons who publicly and actively favor the state schools
                                and are their defenders and protectors.</item>
                            <label/>
                            <item>All to be first forewarned.</item>
                            <label>5th.</label>
                            <item>When it is a question of administering the last sacraments, one
                                rule must be observed. In extremes, extremes must be resorted to; so
                                that if nothing else can be obtained it will suffice if the sick
                                will promise to do everything which the church requires of
                                him.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I also stated that a committee had been appointed to take testimony in the
                        different districts in regard to the action of the clergy. That committee
                        made its report at the recent session, stating it had taken the testimony of
                        nearly five thousand witnesses in the different provinces.</p>
                    <p>The report clearly reveals the fact that the coercive programme of the
                        bishops had been faithfully carried out. The Catholic minority of the
                        committee declined to act upon it, and the Catholic members of Parliament
                        declined to debate the report when presented.</p>
                    <p>The ministry interpreted their silence as confession of all its charges
                        against the church authorities.</p>
                    <p>Both parties await the results of the election in June with intense interest.
                        Should it restore the Catholic party to power the clergy will be reinstated
                        to their former educational relations in the state schools. But it will not
                        be an end of the conflict, which is here “irrepressible” and will end only
                        when the victory of one of the parties shall be so decisive as to make
                        hopeless a continuation of the struggle.</p>
                    <p>I inclose a translation of a leading article of one of the organs of the
                        Catholic party, “The Brussels Courrier.” This hostility to the school law
                        and to the present Liberal ministry is met by the other side with equal
                        determination.</p>
                    <p>The Liberals of Belgium are in sympathy with the most advanced ideas on the
                        subject of the disunion of church and state. I would say <pb n="12"
                            xml:id="pg_12" facs="0084"/>their hostility to any co-operation of the
                        church with state administration has nothing to learn from the French school
                        of liberals, while the Belgian clergy adhere to the Syllabus and its logical
                        consequences with uncompromising spirit.</p>
                    <p>If the new school system shall be permanently established, the question
                        suggests itself to an on-looker, how will religious education be supplied to
                        the children of the peasantry when the clergy have no further relations with
                        the state schools, as lay religious teaching, which, under our elastic
                        system, has almost monopolized the religious education of our youth, is not
                        admitted by the Catholic church? I apprehend the church of Belgium will find
                        it difficult under the system of separation to maintain the education of its
                        communion at its old standard, and increasingly so with each succeeding
                        generation.</p>

                            the Sacred Heart, and which honors as its patron, Saint Joseph, given in

                            condemned to be the slave of the lodges and of liberalism?</p>
                        <p>The thousands of children withdrawn from an atheistic education by the
                            devotion of Belgian Catholics, will they not daily address their prayers
                            to Heaven for the salvation of the nation and the victory of their
                            generous protectors? A nation so nobly devoted to Catholicism cannot be
                            left to perish by demoralization and atheism.</p>
                        <p>The minister who has unworthily driven away the Papal nuncio will, in his
                            turn, be expelled from power by the electoral verdict.</p>
                        <p>How can he rise from his discredit, he who has shocked the public
                            conscience by removing so many public functionaries? The hour has come
                            when the country will call him to exact account for his action. Why has
                            he dishonored Belgium in the eyes of Europe by driving away the
                            representative of the Pope? Why has he dishonored and made discontented
                            our army by taking from it its chaplains? Why has he held always
                            suspended his threats over the head of his employés, whom he has
                            compelled to sacrifice their children to an education <hi rend="italic"
                                >without God?</hi> Why has he profaned our cemeteries, spirited away
                            our student funds, robbed our churches and sacred houses, despoiled of
                            their property so many pious foundations, instituted by liberty and
                            charity for the solace of the poor, the disinherited by fortune? Why has
                            he ruined our agriculture and wasted millions of the public treasure to
                            unchristianize Catholic Belgium? Why has he covered the soil of the
                            country with fortresses and atheneums of atheism or indifferentism? Why
                            has he tortured our consciences by his traveling committee all over the
                            country to terrorize our people? Why does he make a crime in our priests
                            that which for them is a sacred duty? Who has constrained our clergy to
                            refuse absolution to the abettors of the law of education without God?
                            He. Who abolished the law of 1842? He. Who desires education without
                            God? He. Who, notwithstanding the supplication of three hundred thousand
                            fathers of families, determined upon that disastrous law to roll
                            Catholocism into the ditch? He.</p>
                        <p>Yes, for that cause families are divided, the communes are in two hostile
                            camps, and Belgians arrayed in two armies; and he is responsible for the
                            sad fruits, the enmities, and discords it has created.</p>
                        <p>The electors will call to account this minister for his unwise
                            expenditures, for all <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0085"/>the evils
                            he has occasioned, for all the discords and disunions which he has sown,
                            even in the smallest hamlets.</p>
                        <p>Like another Nero, this minister has, by his school law, lighted the
                            fires of discord in 2,500 hamlets of Belgium, and to relieve himself of
                            the load of hate with which he is menaced by the electors he calumniates
                            the clergy and accuses them of having kindled the flames of
                            dissension.</p>
                        <p>The clergy did not enter upon the struggle until the minister declared
                            war. They created the free schools only after the suppression by the
                            lodges [Masonic] of the schools founded under the law of 1842.</p>
                        <p>Now the fulfillment of their duty is made a crime, as is their resistance
                            of an attack which it sought to avoid. Very well; honor to the clergy
                            whom he would dishonor. If Belgium remains a free country, a Catholic
                            country, it is to the clergy we shall be indebted. Without their
                            resistance and devotion we should have perished through the public
                            torpor.</p>
                        <p>The youth of Belgium had been irrecoverably devoted to indifferentism and
                            atheism. Yes, you lodges, you Free Masons, you Liberals, we understand
                            the reason of your fury against our priests; it is they who have united
                            Catholic Belgium, to a man, to save their faith and their liberty. They
                            have done their duty; we attest it to their honor. Had their resistance
                            to the school law proved as serious an obstacle to the restoration of
                            Catholics to power as it has proved an auxiliary, our fathers would
                            still have besought the clergy to contend for their faith, perish what
                            would.</p>
                        <p>Let us then pray as our fathers prayed and act as they acted. Let us
                            triumph over the lodges and liberalism as they triumphed over the
                            Josephism of the revolution and Orangeism. Let us act and pray as we
                            think of the 13th of June and its consequences. It involves the
                            salvation or the corruption of infancy and our youth. It involves the
                            peace or spoliation of the clergy, repose, or expropriation of the
                            religious communities; it involves public slavery or universal
                            deliverance.</p>

                        so amended section 170 of the Civil Code relating to marriage as to
                        authorize Belgian diplomatic and consular agents, under certain
                        circumstances, to perform the marriage service between a Belgian and a

                        the “Exposé des motifs.”</p>

                                marriage of Belgians in foreign
                            countries.—Translation.]</seg></opener>
                        <p>Belgians can without difficulty follow the method prescribed by articles
                            47 and 170 of the Civil Code in countries where the civil authority is
                            invested with the power to perform the marriage ceremony. Among such
                            countries in Europe are France, Germany, Italy, Holland, Grand Duchy of
                            Luxembourg, Roumania, and Switzerland.</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere many obstacles exist. In England parties desiring it may be
                            married by the local authority. But we do not know that the civil
                            marriage is customary in Ireland, in Austria-Hungary, and in Russia. It
                            is not possible in Sweden, in Norway, and in Denmark, except in cases
                            where the parties are of different religions.</p>
                        <p>Canonical marriage is still the rule in Spain, where the civil marriage
                            is allowed only in the case of dissenters, and in Portugal the
                            celebration of marriage of Catholics is by the church, by virtue of a
                            commission from the state. Of countries where the want of authority in
                            our consuls creates most lamentable situations may be reckoned the
                            Turkish dominions. There persons who do not follow the law of the <pb
                                n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0086"/>Prophet cannot regularly marry,
                            the civil state of Turkey being based upon the Koran, which forbids
                            marriages between Musselmans and Christians. There is the nuptial
                            benediction which a minister of one of the tolerated systems of worship
                            (Greek, Armenian, or other) sometimes consents to give. But what
                            guarantees can such marriages afford in view of our own legislation,
                            celebrated as they usually are without any previous formality?</p>
                        <p>The difficulties which marriages encounter are evidently of a nature
                            which tend to create illegal relations between Belgians living in
                            Mahomedan countries. Do they not for the most part find themselves
                            placed between the alternative of forced celibacy or of irregular life?
                            No less obstacles are in the way of the marriage of our citizens in the
                            Barbary States, on the Mediterranean, and in Egypt. The Greek laws
                            impose on the clergy the responsibility of conducting marriages in due
                            form.</p>
                        <p>Unions are contracted in the Hellenic Kingdom according to the rules of
                            the communion to which the parties belong. If they profess different
                            faiths, the nuptial benediction is given them by the Oriental church,
                            upon the condition that their children shall be educated in the religion
                            of the orthodox party.</p>
                        <p>No country of the east, in this matter of marriage, can be compared with
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Certain ceremonies performed by the family of the contracting parties
                            without the participation either of the magistrate or of the clergy, and
                            the exchange of pieces containing, besides the names of the parties,
                            certain particulars relative to their birth, are sufficient in the
                            Celestial Empire to constitute a perfect legal union. No official act is
                            drawn up, no public registering. Can one imagine how difficult it would
                            be to furnish in Belgium, conformable to articles 47 and 171 of the
                            Civil Code, proof of a marriage celebrated after those patriarchal
                            usages? In Japan the rule as to strangers has been lately modified. At
                            the request of a consular agent, the authorities consented in 1876 to
                            marry two French with Japanese citizens.</p>
                        <p>Although the laws of different States of the United States of America
                            authorize justices of the peace and the town clerks to receive
                            declarations from those who wish to dispense with the services of a
                            clergyman, an immense majority of the marriages are celebrated in the
                            churches or in temples, either according to the decree of the Council of
                            Trent, as at New Orleans, at Saint Louis, and Detroit, or in conformity
                            with the ancient rule in force throughout Christendom before said
                            decree—that is to say, without requiring publication of bans or of
                            domicile.</p>
                        <p>We will add, in conclusion of this summary of information received from
                            our foreign representatives, that in Mexico and in the Republics of
                            Guatemala and of Venezuela marriages take place according to the rules
                            established by the civil authority, while they remain subject to rules
                            prescribed by the Catholic Church in Nicaragua, Ecuador, in Peru, Chili,
                            La Plata, Brazil, and Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>Non-Catholic inhabitants of the last country may sometimes apply to
                            justices of the peace. As a <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> obligatory in
                            some countries, admitted in special cases in others, marriage before the
                            civil authority is impracticable for Belgians over the greatest part of
                            the globe. Those who reside in remote countries have, in general, no
                            other resource than to ask, <hi rend="italic">where circumstances
                                permit</hi>, the nuptial benediction of a clergyman. Now, the
                            inconveniences to which a party is exposed who can marry only according
                            to the rights of some confession are numerous by reason especially of
                            the great variety of sects of which the most widely extended systems of
                            religion are composed. In one place the parties are required to pay
                            enormous fees; elsewhere they are forced to undertakings which are
                            contrary to the liberty of conscience, or the clergy, resting upon
                            canonical obstacles, refuse to lend their offices.</p>
                        <p>For example, before whom can a marriage take place in a Catholic country
                            if one of the parties is a divorced person, a Jew, or belongs to no
                            positive religion? How will the parties proceed who profess a system of
                            faith which does not exist in their place of residence? Where will be
                            the guarantees which the parties have a right to require in this the
                            most important act of their civil life? Is it admissible, in view of
                            these facts, there where the clergy does not observe the formalities
                            prescribed by the Council of Trent, that persons be married by a priest
                            to whom they are unknown? Is it not to be feared, in certain countries
                            at least, that questions will arise based upon the want of the sacred
                            character of the party who shall perform the ceremony? And may not the
                            church registers be stolen, mutilated, or destroyed either in time of
                            insurrection, or by fire, flood, or earthquake?</p>
                        <p>This situation demands the extreme solicitude of the government. If it
                            encourages its young men who have made a specialty of certain studies to
                            establish themselves among nations with which we are interested to
                            extend our relations, if it invites Belgian commerce to found houses in
                            remote countries, and to create new markets, and so increase the wealth
                            of the country, it is incumbent upon it to see that its citizens who so
                            expatriate themselves may by an act valid in Belgium constitute a
                            legitimate Belgian family.</p>
                        <p>The “Exposé des Motifs” then proceeds to state that in taking this step
                            it is but following the example of England, Germany, Italy, Holland, and
                            Switzerland; that this right to perform the marriage ceremony conferred
                            on its diplomatic and consular <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0087"

                            and in countries where the local civil authorities do not afford
                            desirable guarantees; that it is further limited to cases specially
                            authorized by the minister of foreign affairs (Belgium). It further
                            recognizes the fact that, as a matter of law, this new provision may not
                            be deemed legal in the countries where they are made; but it adds,
                            “while this may so be, a very important point is gained, from a moral
                            point of view, since authority is given to substitute for illegitimate
                            relations a conjugal union perfectly valid in Belgium, and which all the
                            members of its family can sustain when they return to their
                            country.”</p>
                        <p>It further states that upon the passage of the proposed law the
                            diplomatic and consular agents who may be authorized to perform the
                            marriage ceremony will be instructed— <list>

                        <seg rendition="#left">No. 159.]</seg></opener>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that the election of
                        the 13th instant, referred to in my dispatch No. 153, resulted in favor of
                        the liberal party.</p>
                    <p>Ghent, which elects four senators and eight deputies, proved to be the key of
                        the situation.</p>
                    <p>At four o’clock in the afternoon it was announced that the Catholics had
                        elected their candidates. Later advices assured the success of the
                        ministerial party by a majority of sixty in that city.</p>
                    <p>The demonstrations which followed on the part of the liberals at the capital
                        during a large part of the night was of the most enthusiastic character. The
                        streets were thronged with people parading with bands of music and
                        illuminations. There was apprehension of disturbance, and a portion of the
                        civic guard was called out under arms and distributed in different parts of
                        the city, but no violent demonstrations occurred.</p>
                    <p>The liberals have a small increase of strength in both houses. Their majority
                        will be six in the new senate, instead of four, and of eighteen in the
                        chamber of deputies, instead of fourteen, as in the last Parliament. This
                        secures the continuation of the general policy of the liberal
                        government.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0088"/>
                    <p>The school law of 1879 will be maintained. This law is regarded by the
                        Catholic party the most dangerous of all the liberal measures, not only for
                        their political ascendancy, but for the maintenance of the Catholic faith
                        among the peasantry.</p>
                    <p>It will compel Catholics to accept the secular school system or to continue
                        at very heavy expense their church schools. The centralization of the
                        educational department in the government, instead of giving the control of
                        state schools to the several communes, will be maintained.</p>
                    <p>It was avowed in the canvass by the leader of the Catholic party that should
                        it succeed at the election the office of minister of instruction would be
                        abolished. The suspension of diplomatic relations with the Vatican will
                        doubtless be continued. They would have been resumed had the Catholic party
                        succeeded.</p>
                    <p>The liberal party has been heavily weighted in this canvass by the radicalism
                        of some of its members and candidates.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the party are not in favor of any considerable extension of the
                        suffrage.</p>
                    <p>A portion of its radical element demanded universal suffrage; another portion
                        a suffrage based upon an educational test.</p>
                    <p>The more radical element is organized in a permanent body called “La Ligue
                        pour la Réforme Electorale.” The extreme attitude taken by some of the
                        leaders of this organization on the suffrage question, involving a revision
                        of the constitution in that respect, gave alarm to many of the moderates,
                        and in the capital led to an “independent” movement, with which the
                        Catholics allied themselves and seriously imperiled the success of the
                        liberal candidates. Their majority was reduced by this action from 4,000 to
                        1,000 in Brussels.</p>
                    <p>The liberal party has now as much to fear from its own internal divisions on
                        the suffrage question as from the opposition. The rapid growth of the large
                        towns and of manufacturing centers, where the liberal strength principally
                        lies, and the stationary population of the rural districts, where the
                        clerical influence prevails, favor the continued ascendancy of the liberal
                        party. On the other hand, the radicalism of a minority of the party alarms
                        the more conservative portion, and it will tax the the wisdom of the
                        ministry to the utmost to harmonize the elements.</p>
                    <p>The liberal government has now two years to solidify its power. It will then
                        be again subjected to the ordeal of a general election.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatches from Berne I had occasion
                        frequently to bring to your predecessor’s notice the abuses and dangers of
                        assisted emigration. In one of those dispatches I cited a writer on
                        political economy who advocated assisted emigration as the principal panacea
                        for Ireland’s woes.</p>
                    <p>What was then the mere proposal of a voluntary contributor of the <pb n="17"

                        the statute book of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>The London Times of 21st and 22d instant gives an account of the debate in
                        the House of Commons committee of the whole on the second reading of the new
                        government clause of the “arrears of rent (Ireland) bill,” empowering
                        guardians of the poor to borrow money for the assistance of emigration. The
                        sum which is to be allowed to each emigrant is £5, and although it was
                        maintained by many of the speakers that such a sum was inadequate, and that
                        the emigrant should be provided with something beyond the bare cost of
                        transportation, the bill was passed to a third reading. The cable, the
                        press, and the legation in London will advise you before I can of its
                        ultimate fate.</p>
                    <p>You can judge better than I can what the effects of this measure will be upon
                        the immigration we will receive by virtue of its workings. Mr. Trevelyan,
                        the chief advocate of the emigration scheme, is reported as saying: <quote

                                demoralizing. A sum of even less than £5 would encourage emigration.

                        correspondent of that paper reports that the Russian refugee relief
                        committee at Philadelphia shipped sixty back to Liverpool, being unable to
                        provide for them.</p>
                    <p>On the 24th instant the Times’ Philadelphia correspondent cabled the text of
                        a letter from the president of the relief society to the Mansion House
                        committee, who had been instrumental in forwarding the emigrants alluded to.
                        The letter states: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>Is it to be expected that the inmates of Irish poor-houses will be able to
                        succeed if landed penniless on our shores? I make no distinction against the
                        Irish; I have shown the misery that assisted emigration entailed upon the
                        Swiss; the distress amongst the Russian emigrants assisted by the mistaken
                        philanthropy of the Mansion House committee is attested by the letter above
                        cited. In regard to the scheme proposed by Parliament to assist emigration
                        from Ireland, I cannot do better than quote the remarks of Mr. T. O’Connor,
                        himself an Irishman, who has studied the practical workings of emigration,
                        upon the discussion of the bill in question: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The government had announced their willingness to take advantage of
                                voluntary agencies; which meant that they would pay £5 to get the
                                tenant out of the country, and leave the rest to Mr. Tuke. In so
                                doing the government of course surrendered the most important part
                                of the business into Mr. Tuke’s hands. No doubt that gentleman was
                                inspired by the best motives, and had done good service to Ireland,
                                but the government were pursuing a course that was radically wrong,
                                and they would find that the question could not be settled
                                satisfactorily by simply transferring Irish paupers into white
                                slaves in America. Every country to which those emigrants were sent
                                had a right to demand that they should be a source of wealth and not
                                of poverty to the land of their adoption, and that they should not
                                be handed over to any employer of labor who should take them on Mr.
                                Tuke’s terms.</p>

                    <p>In the interest of these poor emigrants, as well as in that of the American
                        tax-payer, it is to be hoped that Mr. O’Connor’s presentiments as to their
                        future lot may not be realized. It is, however, incumbent on us, if we do
                        not desire to assume the responsibility and expense of their support, to
                        legislate to prevent them from being cast upon our charity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The sending back of destitute Russian
                        emigrants is attracting attention, and if followed by the return of
                        considerable numbers of those of other nationalities, will serve to check
                        the abuses now being carried on. The weak points in the present system of
                        returning objectionable emigrants are that there is a lack of uniformity in
                        its operation, and that the expense is borne by the American public, either
                        in the way of taxes or by voluntary contributions.</p>
                    <p>The inclosed extract from the “Étoile Belge” of this morning gives an account
                        of the return of forty destitute Russian Israelites by the Pennland. In it
                        there is a tacit reproach to America for not keeping them, while the refusal
                        of the Russian consul at Antwerp to recognize them as Russians, on the
                        ground of having lost their nationality by emigrating without permission, is
                        described as “cruelly correct.” The tacit reproach to the United States is
                        thoroughly in accord with the prevalent European sentiment that anything or
                        anybody is good enough for America. The article in the “Étoile Belge” is
                        taken from the “Précurseur”, of Antwerp, and is reproduced in the
                        “Independence Belge” of this morning without the invidious comments of the
                        original article.</p>
                    <p>The Antwerp Israelite association deserves credit for aiding their
                        coreligionists in proceeding towards their native land. It remains to be
                        seen whether the Russian officials will permit them to return to their
                        native country; and this question may give rise to a controversy between
                        Germany and Russia which will furnish at least one of the European powers an
                        opportunity of testing the advantages derived from having foreign paupers
                        cast upon its territory.</p>

                        <p>Some forty Russian Israelites arrived yesterday at Antwerp on the
                            Pennland, of the Red Star Line. These unfortunate people, driven from
                            their country by the cruelties of persecution, sought a refuge on the
                            hospitable soil of the New World, but, totally destitute, they found it
                            impossible to establish themselves.</p>
                        <p>It is in this condition that America sends them back to us.</p>
                        <p>The Russian consul at Antwerp states that his country people are totally
                            without means of existence, and he adds conscientiously that having
                            emigrated from Russia to America without permission of the Russian
                            Government (emigration will go on nevertheless!), they have lost their
                            Russian nationality, and consequently he has nothing to do with them. He
                            therefore addresses them a cruelly correct <hi rend="italic">nescio

                        <p>The exiles were, by the assistance of the Israelite association of
                            Antwerp, lodged at No. 14 Canal St. Jean, and yesterday morning were
                            shipped to Cologne, thence to be forwarded to the Russian

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 3d instant I had an extended interview
                        with the minister of foreign affairs, Senhor F. Franco de Sá, regarding the
                        proposed Congress of American States to be held in Washington in November
                        next, to which the Department instructions numbered 8, 9, and 10 refer.</p>
                    <p>The interview lasted fully an hour, and was of an exceedingly agreeable
                        character. After the usual interchange of courtesies I explained to the
                        minister the purpose of my visit, and then proceeded to read to him
                        instruction No. 8.</p>
                    <p>The reading progressed quite slowly and was frequently interrupted with
                        questions, explanations, and discussions.</p>
                    <p>Senhor Franco de Sá seemed much interested in the subject, paying the
                        strictest attention to the language of the instruction and to what I had to
                        offer, and his frequent expressions of approval as well as his manner
                        convinced me that the project which I was presenting had his entire
                        approval. He seemed especially impressed with my presentation of reasons in
                        support of a cordial co-operation in the movement by Brazil, wherein I
                        followed generally the line marked out in No. 9; and as he appeared desirous
                        of knowing something touching the details of the proposed Congress, I made
                        known to him the contents of so much of No. 10 as seemed proper, and left
                        with him a memorandum on that branch of the subject.</p>
                    <p>As directed, I left with the minister a copy of No. 8, and forwarded to him,
                        soon after my return to the legation, a brief note in which, in the name of
                        the President, I formally invited His Majesty the Emperor to send two
                        representatives to the Congress.</p>
                    <p>As yet, I have no answer to my note; but I shall expect one soon, as the
                        minister assured me that the subject should receive prompt consideration. I
                        know that the Emperor has spoken approvingly of our purposes in this
                        connection, and 1 cannot doubt that the response will be satisfactory.</p>

                        yesterday, in which I gave an account of my interview with the minister of
                        foreign affairs, Senhor F. Franco de Sá, touching the proposed Peace
                        Congress of American States, I am in receipt of a note from that gentleman
                        in response to mine of the 3d instant inviting the co-operation of Brazil, a
                        copy of which, accompanied by an English translation, is herewith
                        inclosed.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that my predictions as to the character of the answer were
                        correct. The Government of Brazil has accepted the invitation, and I am not
                        without reasons for knowing that His Majesty the Emperor looks forward to
                        the assembling of the Congress with much interest, and that he hopes that
                        great good may result therefrom.</p>
                    <p>It is more than likely that both of the representatives of this government
                        will have a knowledge of the English language, but I am not aware that any

                            of His Excellency the President of the same States, to the effect that
                            Brazil may send two commissioners to the Congress to be held at
                            Washington the 22d of November to consider and discuss the means of

                            will be represented at the Congress that is projected, in conformity

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my No. 19 I acquainted you, in a brief
                        dispatch, with the substance of a statement made in the Senate by the
                        minister of foreign relations, Senhor F. Franco de Sá, touching the proposed
                        Peace Congress of American States, and I now have the honor to inclose the
                        text of the discussion as it appeared in the official organ.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Senator Junqueira, who presented the inquiry, has expressed an opinion
                        regarding the Congress, which prevails to a considerable extent. He seems to
                        think that the movement would prove futile unless the action of the Congress
                        should include means of enforcing its determination, and that, therefore,
                        there is danger that the Government of Brazil may become involved in
                        international disputes in which they have no concern.</p>
                    <p>As above intimated, Senator Junqueira is not alone in this view of the
                        question, and I fear that it is shared even to a limited extent by the
                        minister of foreign relations. That European influence has been quite
                        actively exerted for the purpose of making this the opinion of the country,
                        will not admit of a doubt, and it would be strange, indeed, in view of all
                        the circumstances, if these efforts should have been entirely without avail.
                        The frequent references of late in the press to the great and growing power
                        of the United States, interspersed with occasional comments regarding our
                        foreign policy, in which has generally figured a scheme for the absorption
                        of one or more of our American neighbors, have tended somewhat to excite the
                        fears of the timid, and have furnished a topic for those who have been
                        interested in kindling the jealousies and the prejudices of the weak.</p>
                    <p>From the reply of Mr. Franco de Sá, the foreign minister, I extract: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen has declared, in a dispatch to the envoy
                                extraordinary of that Republic [the United States] near the
                                Government of Chili, that the announced Congress was indefinitely
                                postponed. The Government of Brazil has not yet received this
                                information of the act of the American Government, probably because
                                the minister accredited here has not, as yet, received a dispatch on
                                the subject.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>And further on he says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The Congress, however, as I have already declared, has been postponed
                                indefinitely, and it is presumed that an appropriate communication
                                will be made to us soon.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The positive character of the minister’s statement tended to impress me with
                        the belief that the government were desirous of being relieved from their
                        promise to participate in the Congress, and I, therefore, during a visit
                        which I made to the minister on the 15th instant, delicately intimated a
                        desire to talk with him touching his declaration. He stated that he had read
                        your instruction to Mr. Trescot, modifying the instruction of your
                        predecessor, and Mr. Blaine’s letter to the President, and gave me to
                        understand that his conclusion regarding the postponement was based upon
                        these documents. I stated to him that I had received no communication from
                        my government indicating a disposition to either withdraw its invitation or
                        to postpone the Congress, and that if there was any such purpose in view, I
                        did not doubt that I would be promptly advised of it. In response to a
                        remark from him, indicating some anxiety for further and more positive
                        information, I then told him that I would communicate with you fully, and
                        that I thought I could safely <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0095"/>assure
                        him that I would be advised by telegraph whether the Congress would be held
                        as originally proposed or not.</p>
                    <p>While Senhor de Sá did not intimate that his government were desirous that
                        the Congress should not be held, still I left with the impression that he
                        would prefer to be advised that the Government of the United States had so
                        determined. If the determination, however, should be otherwise, I am
                        inclined to the belief that this government will be represented in the
                        Congress. The character of their participation can be easily anticipated
                        from a reading of the remarks of the minister.</p>

                                november</hi>.</head>
                        <p>Senhor <hi rend="smallcaps">Junqueira</hi>. In the Diario Official of the
                            3d instant I read the following: “The imperial government has been
                            invited by the United States of North America to send two commissioners
                            to the Congress which is to be opened at Washington the 22d of November
                            of the current year, to consider and discuss the best means of averting
                            war between the American nations. The imperial government has accepted
                            the invitation.”</p>
                        <p>In what light will the Senate treat this important question? The
                            Government of the United States of North America invited the nations of
                            this continent to send representatives to a Congress that is to be held
                            in the capital of those States in November of this year, for the purpose
                            of discussing and discovering the means of preventing war between the
                            American nations. The imperial government accepted this invitation.</p>
                        <p>If it was a question of a particular society, of a reunion of
                            philosophers, having for its object the prevention of war, we should
                            not, surely, be opposed, because it is always laudable to commend the
                            efforts which are made to avert such a calamity. But this treats of
                            governments, and all the world understands that a reunion of this order,
                            so ostentatious, has not platonic sentiment for its sole aim, but that
                            it has in view something more positive and more real.</p>
                        <p>Serious steps are to be taken on the part of the American governments in
                            the sense of averting the calamity of war on our continent, and
                            therefore it shall be necessary to have the exacted obligations, without
                            any convention, any agreement, of whatever may be determined upon; so,
                            as I have stated, it will not pass as a manifestation wholly
                            platonic.</p>
                        <p>The noble minister of foreign affairs being present, I ask of his
                            excellency some explanations, and I shall place my petition (<hi
                                rend="italic">requerimento</hi>) upon the table if he does not
                            prefer an adjournment.</p>
                        <p>I have for this purpose requested a copy of the invitation referred to
                            which was addressed to us by the Cabinet at Washington.</p>
                        <p>As I foresee some perils in the course which may possibly be adopted, I
                            consider it to be the duty of a representative of the nation to cause
                            debate on that question to be opened, in order that our destinies may
                            not be decided entirely without our having been heard, and a treaty or
                            agreement formed which binds the nation and may hereafter cause us great
                            sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>The Senate understands that it is a very difficult matter to avert war
                            between the American States. Unfortunately, at the present time, there
                            still exists a great war between the Republics of Peru, Bolivia, and
                            Chili.</p>
                        <p>In the Cabinet at Washington the post of foreign affairs was directed by
                            Mr. Blaine, no doubt a distinguished gentleman and diplomatist, who,
                            according to the journals, placed himself at the head of a policy
                            somewhat reckless. It was this gentleman who addressed the invitation to
                            the imperial government as well as to the other American
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>I request the noble minister of foreign affairs if, Mr. Blaine having
                            withdrawn from the Cabinet, his successor has confirmed the invitation
                            extended to the imperial government, or if the invitation has been
                            withdrawn, or postponed <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi></p>
                        <p>I read in an accredited gazette—<hi rend="italic">Le Brésil</hi>—now
                            published in Paris, that the successor of Mr. Blaine will not pursue the
                            same line of policy. The article I refer to opens with the following
                            words—having for epigraph Chili and Peru. (Reading:)</p>
                        <p>“Eight days ago we received from the United States a serious
                            announcement; Mr. Blaine, Secretary of State, before tendering his
                            resignation, invited all the American <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24"
                                facs="0096"/>States to meet in convention in Washington, the 30th of
                            November of this year. We learn with lively satisfaction that Mr.
                            Frelinghuysen, the new Secretary of State, has recalled this fantasy of
                            his predecessor. He remembered, at the time, that Washington, in his
                            famous a dress to the American people, on withdrawing from power, among
                            other counsels and warnings respecting the future, insisted upon the
                            necessity, for the welfare of the republic, of abstaining scrupulously
                            from what he called, with so much energy, entangling alliances.”</p>
                        <p>The patriarch of American independence gave this counsel to his
                            countrymen, that external questions might not involve them in grave
                            complications. I, also, believe this should be our policy; endeavor to
                            maintain our position, disposing the means necessary for our
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>But to me it does not appear that it is desirable that we should by any
                            form concur in an exacted obligation, (<hi rend="italic">sanccaô
                                penal</hi>), that is, with coercive measures, that war shall not
                            arise between two American States, in some of which it is very easy.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, foreseeing that Brazil might be seriously compromised by
                            the result, I take the liberty of making these observations, believing
                            it is not entirely <hi rend="italic">inapropos</hi> that the legislative
                            power, the representatives of the nation, know just to what point the
                            imperial government desires to go in this matter, and if, by chance, the
                            acceptance of the invitation referred to, notwithstanding the
                            negotiations are to be treated <hi rend="italic">ad referendum</hi>,
                            could produce difficulties, and likewise grave embarrassments to the
                            empire.</p>
                        <p>My resolution is couched in these terms. (Reads:)</p>
                        <p>“I request that, through the minister of foreign affairs, the government
                            be requested to furnish a copy of the invitation of the Cabinet at
                            Washington to a Congress which is to meet at Washington, in the month of
                            November next, to discuss the best means of averting war between the
                            American nations.”</p>
                        <p>The nations sometimes, in good faith, and with the most sincere
                            intentions, assemble to adjust in a similar manner their differences;
                            they have always the laudable desire to preserve peace between them, but
                            the general result accomplished by these congresses is known.</p>
                        <p>The Senate has record that in 1854 France and England entered into
                            various understandings for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of
                            the Ottoman Empire; that is to say, to maintain peace in Europe. Yet in
                            consequence of this convention celebrated between France and England,
                            there followed in a short time an armed struggle known as the war of the
                            Crimea.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish that the same should occur in my country; I do not desire
                            that in any eventuality we accept compromises which bring to us
                            embarrassments. Therefore, if the noble minister would give us the
                            satisfactory explanations, I would withdraw my petition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Franco de Sá</hi> (minister of foreign affairs):
                            Mr. President, I do not see any inconvenience in approving the petition
                            of the noble senator of Bahia. I can at once give the explanations his
                            excellency desires. In fact, the notice in the <hi rend="italic">Diario
                                Official</hi> was ordered published by the foreign office. Brazil
                            received, and accepted, an invitation of the American Government when
                            the minister of foreign affairs was Mr. Blaine, whose policy I cannot
                            say was reckless, as asserted by the noble senator, but rather somewhat
                            active and enterprising. But his successor, Mr. Frelinghuysen, is
                            pursuing a course more moderate and more in conformity with the
                            traditions of those states, a policy outlined in the counsel given by
                            Washington, its founder, in the celebrated document known as the
                            farewell address.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen has declared in a dispatch to the envoy extraordinary
                            of that republic, near the Government of Chili, that the announced
                            Congress was indefinitely postponed. The Government of Brazil has not
                            yet received this information of the act of the American Government,
                            probably because the minister accredited here has not, as yet, received
                            a dispatch on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government accepted the invitation which was addressed to
                            it, because it understood that it was not right to refuse to take part
                            in a solemn reunion in which, under the initiative of the government of
                            a great nation, the general interests of America are to be discussed, to
                            the end that the humanitarian and commendable desire to avert civil and
                            international wars prevail.</p>
                        <p>But in this invitation or document were two important declarations of the
                            government of the United States. First, that the base of discussion of
                            the labors of the Congress shall be, that all international difficulties
                            should be settled by arbitration; and, second, that the Congress shall
                            not occupy itself with any pending question, such as Panama, and, much
                            less, the republics of the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>We do not go, therefore, to discuss anything difficult or delicate that
                            actually exists; we go solely to discuss conditions which shall serve
                            for the future to avert the development of grave divergencies and
                            conflicts between American nations. For my part, I say frankly to the
                            Senate, that I do not repose great confidence in the practical efficacy
                            of the Congress under discussion.</p>
                        <p>It is an idea which already has been advanced many times by philosophers
                            and publicists, <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0097"/>which has been
                            attempted to be realized in Europe through the initiative of some
                            sovereigns, but has not succeeded in the Old World.</p>
                        <p>We shall, perhaps, in this instance be more fortunate; but in any event,
                            the great embarrassment will be that indicated by the noble Senator—the
                            way of practically executing the stipulations of such treaty as may be
                            celebrated, should any of the nations who sign desire to violate it. It
                            will be necessary to make war to avert war.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, gentlemen, not only because of respect for the government
                            that sent us the invitation, but also because some benefit might result
                            from this Congress, the imperial government accepted the invitation.</p>
                        <p>Without doubt the interchange of views, and the discussions between the
                            representatives of the different governments, would result, at least, in
                            strengthening the tie of sympathy between nations. If no other
                            advantages should be gained, it is certain that this one would not be
                            slightly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>It would be very desirable to have all difficulties arising between us
                            decided by arbitration, as was done recently in the controversy between
                            Chili and the Argentine Republic relative to the territory of
                            Patagonia.</p>
                        <p>We have before us this example which leaves the hope that, at least in a
                            few or in many cases, this way of counseling and adjusting by an act so
                            solemn as the decision of a Congress shall be respected by the nations
                            who shall have concurred in it.</p>
                        <p>These were the motives which moved us to accept the invitation, aside
                            from the deference due to the Government of the great American
                            Republic.</p>
                        <p>It appeared to us that there could be no impropriety in it, seeing that
                            the American Government expressed and reiterated the declaration that
                            pending questions should not come before this Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Congress, however, as I have already declared, has been postponed
                            indefinitely, and it is presumed that an appropriate communication will
                            be made to us soon.</p>
                        <p>This is all I have to say to the noble Senator.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The long-continued controversy between Brazil
                        and the Argentine Republic, touching their boundaries, has recently assumed
                        a rather threatening aspect. The territory in dispute lies on the western
                        border of the Brazilian province of Parana, between the rivers Iguazu and
                        Uruguay, and covers an extent of eight hundred square leagues. It is far
                        removed from the civilized settlements, being inhabited only by a few wild
                        Indians, and is covered by dense forests of valuable timber.</p>
                    <p>Pending the controversy the two governments have tacitly assented to the
                        non-exercise of sovereignty over the disputed territory by either, and the
                        present commotion is caused by some action of the Argentine Government,
                        which it is alleged looks to the abandonment of its former policy. It seems
                        that by a law of the Argentine Republic the Missions territory has been
                        transferred from the provincial to the national domain, and by executive
                        decree has been divided into five administrative departments. According to
                        the Argentine claim this territory includes the district in dispute.</p>
                    <p>The adoption of these measures caused considerable anxiety here, and resulted
                        in the sending of an instruction by the government to their minister in
                        Buenos Ayres, having in view the presentation of a protest against what
                        appeared to be the contemplated action. For reasons not known to the public,
                        but which seemed sufficient with the Brazilian minister in Buenos Ayres, the
                        protest was not made, and I am not aware that any correspondence between the
                        two governments has been had on the <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0098"
                        />subject. The newspapers have continued to talk of the matter, however, and
                        the community has not been free from apprehension, notwithstanding the
                        seeming want of alarm in government circles.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless with a view to force the government to disclose their policy, a few
                        days since Baron de Cotegipe caused to be published in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Globo</hi>, an evening newspaper, a letter, of which the inclosed is a
                        translation. The baron is a leading conservative, is president of the
                        Senate, and was minister of foreign relations some years since when his
                        party was in power. The government, in response, caused to be published in
                        the <hi rend="italic">Diario Official</hi> of the 13th instant an article,
                        of which I also inclose a translation.</p>
                    <p>The desire of the government to avoid a public discussion of the subject has
                        been patent to all, but this has not had the effect of silencing the
                        opposition. All efforts, however, having in view a further disclosure have
                        failed, the president of the council of ministers having declared in the
                        Senate that he would not permit himself to be drawn into the discussion at
                        present. He evidently hopes to obtain an assurance that the purposes of the
                        Argentine Government are not hostile, and in the mean time he is,
                        apparently, endeavoring to calm the excited fears of the country. On the
                        15th instant he stated in the Senate that he did not believe there was any
                        cause for alarm; but with this his mouth closed, and he could be induced to
                        say no more.</p>
                    <p>As will be seen by the inclosures, the controversy consists in determining
                        the location of the two streams called the Santo Antonio-Guassú and the
                        Pepiry-Guassú. These streams take their rise in the territory between the
                        Igassú and Uruguay Rivers, and flow in opposite directions, one emptying
                        into the former and the other into the latter. It is conceded that they
                        constitute the line of division between the two countries, but the
                        Argentines contend that the Brazilian location of them is erroneous. They
                        insist that the two streams lying several leagues to the east of the
                        Brazilian location, which appear on the Brazilian maps as the “Chapeco” and
                        the “Chopim,” are, in truth, the Santo Antonio Guassú and the Pepiry-Guassú,
                        and herein consists the question in dispute.</p>
                    <p>These streams were fixed as the line of separation under the provisions of a
                        treaty entered into between Spain and Portugal in 1750. In 1759 a commission
                        visited that locality, in pursuance of the requirements of the treaty, for
                        the purpose of definitely establishing the boundaries, and upon the report
                        of this commission, it seems, both parties to the controversy base their
                        claims.</p>
                    <p>In 1857 an effort was made to arrange the difficulty amicably, and the
                        negotiations to that end resulted in the signing of a treaty which
                        recognized the Brazilian claim. The treaty was, however, rejected by the
                        Argentine Congress.</p>
                    <p>In 1876 another effort was made in the same direction, but without result;
                        since which time, until the recent movements, the question has remained at
                        rest.</p>
                    <p>You will not fail to notice the language of the second paragraph of the
                        article published in the <hi rend="italic">Diario Official</hi>. I quote:

                        <head><hi rend="italic">Letter of Baron de Cotegipe</hi></head>
                        <p>The following letter has been addressed by Baron de Cotegipe to the Globo
                            on the subject of the Argentine decree creating the national territory
                            of Missiones:</p>
                        <p>A month ago, while noticing the promulgation of the decree of the
                            Argentine Government organizing the Missiones territory, you made some
                            important queries. Have they been overlooked, or was it inconvenient to
                            reply to them? The question is not of a reserved kind, especially after
                            the <hi rend="italic">act of force</hi> just effected by our neighbor,
                            in deciding singly what has long been an object of controversy.</p>
                        <p>To those who give no attention to the matter, nothing appears more simple
                            and natural than that decree. It traces the boundary of the Missiones
                            government by the Pepiriguarú, at the Uruguay, to the San Antonio-Guarú,
                            at the Iguazú. But not so to whoever knows that the rivers so called are
                            really the Chapeco and the Chopim, and that our division from the
                            Argentine Republic runs by the Piperiguarú and Santo Antonio, explored
                            and marked in 1759 by the Spanish and Portuguese commissioners, whose
                            mouths are: As to the first at 27° 9’ 23”, and as to the second, 25° 35’
                            4”, for he sees that a large area of terrain has been usurped from us,
                            and what is more, that this tract enters like a wedge between the
                            provinces of Parana, S. Catharine, and Rio Grande de Sul.</p>
                        <p>Before and since our emancipation we have always maintained our right to
                            this territory, declaring categorically that we would maintain it. The
                            Argentine Republic never exercised any act of possession in that region
                            even, because Paraguay lay between any attempt of the kind through its
                            occupation of the Missiones territory, and it has to be noted that
                            Paraguay always respected our limits on this side.</p>
                        <p>I am not aware of any act of the Argentines, unless this of which we
                            treat, that authorizes their intrusion into the disputed lands. On the
                            contrary, there is the treaty of January, 1857, which recognized it as
                            Brazilian domain. And if this treaty, negotiated by the Argentine
                            Government and approved by Congress, was not ratified —for a reason
                            honorable to us—in the end by General Urquiza, under whose Presidency it
                            was made, it is, nevertheless, an historical document, which at least
                            should throw doubt on the right now arrogated by the Argentine
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, in opposition of the daring pretension, there are the documents
                            of the negotiation which took place in 1876 between the minister of
                            foreign affairs, Senhor Irigoyen (the same who has signed the decree of
                                <hi rend="italic">expropriation</hi>), and Baron Aguiar de
                            Andrade.</p>
                        <p>The proceeding of our neighbor, if failing in justice, has the merit of
                            frankness. The Argentine Government commenced by obtaining from Congress
                            authorization to form the Missiones territory into a separate
                            government. It then allowed some time to elapse, and has now cut through
                            all doubts by taking the disputed territory to itself.</p>
                        <p>And what have we been doing?</p>
                        <p>The only act of our government that has come to light, and it merely on
                            the return trip, is what we learn by to-day’s papers, viz:</p>
                        <p>“The Brazilian minister has sent a note to the minister of foreign
                            affairs to inform him that the imperial government, yielding to repeated
                            urgings from the tribes in habiting the Missiones territory between
                            Guarapuava and the Pequiri, has decided on effecting an examination of
                            those lands for the purpose of ascertaining whether they will serve for
                            colonization.</p>
                        <p>“Nevertheless, as the boundary question between the Empire and the
                            Republic is not definitely settled, Brazil, before taking any decision
                            on this matter, has sent a communication to the Argentine Government and
                            consulted it, to prevent false information.</p>
                        <p>“The minister of foreign affairs has sent on the note to his colleague of
                            the Interior. It is supposed that the Argentine Government will <hi
                                rend="italic">consent</hi> to the request of Brazil.”</p>
                        <p>Whence it may be concluded: 1st. That when the Argentine law was voted to
                            nationalize,the Missiones territory, there was nothing done on our side
                            to save our right; 2d. That, when publication was given to the executive
                            decree that included the terrain in litigation, no protest to the same
                            purpose appeared; 3d. That any reclamation has been deprecated by
                            putting the matter in doubt and <hi rend="italic">asking license</hi> to
                            explore on this side of the Pequiri.</p>
                        <p>It is natural that the Argentine Government will reply that if the
                            Pequiri (the Argentine one) is the line it has nothing to permit, but if
                            it is the <hi rend="italic">Brazilian</hi> Peqiuri it cannot permit
                            explorations for the founding of colonies in <hi rend="italic"
                                >national</hi> territory.</p>
                        <p>What will the Government of Brazil say or do? Gulp down the humiliation?
                            Abandon our right? This matter is grave, very grave. It is not by being
                            silent and submitting that we can settle it honorably. The country may
                            be surprised by a serious conflict for which it is not ready.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0100"/>
                        <p>Ill-judged economy has snipped away our means of defense, whilst our
                            neighbors have armed themselves by land and sea, without looking to
                            sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>Right <hi rend="italic">without power</hi> is now a weak barrier between

                        <p>The following official rejoinder appeared in the Diario Official of the
                            13th:</p>
                        <p>The government has not been careless in the boundary question with the
                            Argentine Republic; on the contrary, it has pursued in it the example of
                            lively interest left in the ministry of foreign affairs by Baron de
                            Cotegipe. The incident referred to by his excellency in his letter to
                            the editor of the Globo was the object of immediate attention. As soon
                            as made aware, by telegram from the legation in Montevidéo, that the
                            Argentine Government had submitted to Congress a bill transferring the
                            Missiones territory from the provincial to the national domain,
                            instructions were sent to the envoy in Buenos Ayres to send in a note
                            saving the right of Brazil. It happened, however, that this note was not
                            sent in at the fit moment, for reasons which appeared weighty to our
                            minister in the Argentine Confederation, but which were not accepted by
                            the imperial government. It was then considered that it would be well to
                            await the resolution of Congress and subsequent acts.</p>
                        <p>No Argentine law can extinguish the issue existing between the two
                            states, nor establish a jurisdiction which the imperial government does
                            not recognize. The right of Brazil to the Pepiry Guassu territory
                            subsists in full force and shall be maintained.</p>
                        <p>The recent acts of the Argentine Republic were: a law transferring the
                            Missiones territory from the provincial to the national domain, and an
                            executive decree dividing this territory into five administrative
                            departments. In this decree the rivers Santo Antonio-Guassú and Pepiry
                            Guassú are designated as the boundaries with our territory. These are
                            really the rivers that divide the two countries; the controversy
                            consists in settling what are the rivers that bear these names, the
                            Argentine Republic maintaining that they are not those we indicate, but
                            those we call the Chapeco and Chopim.</p>
                        <p>The international question remains, therefore, on foot, and the act of
                            the Argentine Government cannot in any way affect it so long as it does
                            not attempt to enter upon possession of the disputed territory. The
                            founding of our military colonies cannot furnish motive for reclamation,
                            because these colonies are situated outside that territory, as may be
                            seen in the report presented by Conselheiro Doria to the general
                            assembly.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government has no knowledge of the note said to have been
                            sent in by Baron de Araujo Gondino to the Argentine Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Bolivian minister here has been engaged
                        for several months in the effort to effect an arrangement with the Brazilian
                        Government, which will permit Bolivia to avail herself of the waters of the
                        Amazon for commercial purposes, free from duties, and his labors have
                        finally resulted in the signing of a treaty to that end.</p>
                    <p>The imperial government had already, by decree of December, 1866, guaranteed
                        to the merchant ships of all nations the free navigation of the Amazon and
                        its tributaries. But Bolivian commerce, to reach the Amazon, must avail
                        itself of the Madeira and Marmoré Rivers, the navigation of which is
                        interrupted for some distance within the Brazilian jurisdiction by huge
                        cataracts; and to overcome this difficulty it is proposed <pb n="29"
                            xml:id="pg_29" facs="0101"/>to construct a railway around the falls, a
                        distance of nearly two hundred miles.</p>
                    <p>It is sought by the treaty to apply the same principle to the railway for the
                        purpose of Bolivian commerce that has already been adopted concerning the
                        rivers, and to that end it is stipulated that the use of the road shall be
                        conceded, for the term of fifty years, as well for importations as
                        exportations, free from all and whatever imposts, general, provincial, or
                        municipal, and that it shall only be subject to the tariff that may be
                        established for the transportation of persons and merchandise without
                        distinction of nationality or origin. It is also agreed that the Marmoré
                        River above the falls, whether in Brazilian or Bolivian territory, shall be
                        open to free navigation by both nations.</p>
                    <p>The treaty is silent regarding the time within which the railway is to be
                        built, but it is understood that the Brazilian Government is considering the
                        subject now, and I judge that during the present session of Congress some
                        action will be had having in view the early completion of the work.</p>
                    <p>Geo. Earl Church, an.American citizen, was granted a privilege for the
                        construction of this road in 1870, but after the expenditure of considerable
                        money, and the performance of much labor by the contractors, Messrs.
                        Collins, of Philadelphia, the work was abandoned. Mr. Church has signified
                        his willingness to again undertake the enterprise if the government will
                        concede him the guarantees which are customary in the country, and I shall
                        not be surprised if he is yet permitted to prosecute the work to
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>The tributaries of the Amazon are navigable to the very heart of Bolivia. The
                        vast territory lying to the east of the cordillera of the Andes, in Northern
                        and Central Bolivia, is bathed by their waters, and its commerce should find
                        its way to the sea between their banks. Nature has certainly performed her
                        part in affording that country an outlet. It rests now with man to perform
                        his.</p>
                    <p>It is thought that the treaty will be ratified by the Brazilian Congress.</p>

                        presented to the General Assembly a report, in which, among other topics, he
                        briefly refers to the invitation extended by the United States Government to
                        that of Brazil to participate in the proposed Congress of American States.
                        The minister still entertains the views heretofore expressed by him on this
                        subject in Congress, of which you have been advised in former

                        <p>The imperial government was invited by the United States of America to
                            send two commissioners to a Congress of all the American nations, which,
                            as was proposed, was to be opened in Washington the 22d of November of
                            the present year, and in which were to be discussed the best means of
                            avoiding war between said nations.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the execution of this humanitarian project may be
                            postponed, and it does not seem probable that by the means proposed can
                            so difficult a question be solved; but the effort is worthy of the best
                            support, and the imperial government, as much interested as any others
                            in this part of the world in the preservation of peaceful relations,
                            conformable with its traditional policy, could not refuse the aid which
                            was asked of it. It was quick, therefore, to promise it.</p>
                        <p>The American Government indicated for the opening of the Congress a date
                            so remote as should permit the hope of the republics of Chili, Bolivia,
                            and Peru, which are at war, taking part in its deliberations.</p>
                        <p>Unhappily, perhaps they may not be able to re-establish peace between
                            themselves within the time specified, and may not be prepared,
                            therefore, to proceed, like the other nations, without preoccupations
                            which might prejudice the ends of the Congress, and without which this,
                            the Congress, would seem destined to intervene directly or indirectly in
                            a business of which it should remain entirely free.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government is not yet informed if the invitation has been
                            accepted by others. It still maintains its resolution, and will take the
                            necessary measures to the end that Brazil may be represented on the
                            designated occasion.</p>

                    <p>In consequence of two questions which have arisen between Brazil and the
                        Republic of Uruguay their relations have become somewhat strained.</p>
                    <p>It is claimed by this government that in November of 1880 a battalion of
                        Uruguayan cavalry which was employed in the Uruguayan province of Tuacarembo
                        pressed into the military service a considerable number of Brazilian
                        citizens, five of whom were, with the approval of the commander of the
                        force, Lieutenant-Colonel Santos, brutally and without cause put to death.
                        During the past year a vast deal of testimony has been taken by the
                        Brazilian consul-general in Montevideo, all tending to sustain this general
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>The Uruguayan authorities, at the solicitation of the Brazilian legation in
                        Montevideo, undertook an investigation of the charges, and the result has
                        recently been laid before this government. The commission intrusted with the
                        inquiry conclude that the complaint is groundless, and the Uruguayan
                        Government, in forwarding the determination here, express the hope that the
                        incident may be regarded as at an end. The Brazilian Government, however, do
                        not appear to be content to let the affair drop. They are confident of the
                        truth of the allegations made, <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0103"/>and
                        seem inclined to urge upon the republic the punishment of the offenders; but
                        I fail to discover any indications of a disposition upon their part to press
                        their view of the matter to the extent of interrupting their friendly
                        relations with their comparatively defenseless neighbor.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The other question has reference to financial transactions between the two
                        governments. It is conceded, I believe, that Uruguay is indebted to Brazil
                        on account of advances made at various times to the extent of some millions
                        of dollars, but I am not sure that they agree as to the exact condition of
                        the account. According to the Brazilian claim the debt now amounts to about
                        nine millions, the major part of which is for interest. This government has
                        been urging an adjustment of the matter, and some steps have been recently
                        essayed by the Uruguayan legation here, having apparently that object in
                        view; but I am not aware that anything approaching an understanding has been
                        reached.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The government professes to believe that these questions will ultimately be
                        amicably arranged. They disclaim any purpose of an attempt to enforce their
                        demands by other than peaceful means, and I know of no reason for
                        distrusting their sincerity. There is, it is true, some sentiment here which
                        would justify a bold movement, having for its object the forced absorption
                        of Uruguay, but it has not reached dangerous proportions. The present
                        government have expressed themselves quite emphatically in opposition to any
                        step in that direction, and I do not doubt that they have correctly
                        interpreted the will of the nation. In addition to the causes which I have
                        enumerated, it is urged in support of the said policy that the government of
                        the republic is weak and inefficient to the extent of being incapable of
                        performing its proper functions. There are some forty thousand Brazilians in
                        the northern portion of the republic. These people and their property, it is
                        claimed, receive no efficient protection at the hands of the government. It
                        is also urged that the recklessness of that country, in its dealings with
                        foreigners and foreign interests, is liable at any moment to produce a war
                        in which this government might find it difficult to maintain a position of
                        neutrality; that its existence is a constant menace to peace in this part of
                        the world; and that the only effectual remedy for these evils is a
                        destruction of its nationality.</p>
                    <p>There are those, too, who profess to believe that the interests of
                        civilization would be subserved by a forced division of that country between
                        Brazil and the Argentine Republic. This scheme has been quietly discussed by
                        some of the prominent politicians of the country, but as yet there are no
                        indications that it would meet with favor at the hands of this government,
                        even if it should be acceptable to the Argentine Republic. The minister of
                        foreign relations, in the course of a response to an interpellation in the
                        House of Deputies a few days ago, approached this subject very delicately,
                        and apparently with much caution, measuring his words, deprecated its public
                        discussion, asserting at the same time that Brazil was disposed to observe
                        her treaty obligations with Uruguay, and was not anxious for territorial
                        acquisition in that quarter.</p>
                    <p>It has occurred to me, however, that the day may come when the republic will
                        propose to pay its debt to the empire with territory. The policy of
                        accepting such a proposition would undoubtedly find many influential
                        advocates here, and it is possible that the government might feel inclined
                        to give it a favorable consideration. Just how far the President of the
                        United States ought to acquiesce in a voluntary transfer by an American
                        republic of its domain to a monarchical power <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32"
                            facs="0104"/>presents, I apprehend, a question of no slight moment.
                        There may be no occasion for its consideration on account of the situation
                        here, and yet I shall not be surprised if the contrary proves to be
                        true.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                        dispatch No. 37, of the 19th ultimo, relating to questions pending between
                        Brazil and Uruguay.</p>
                    <p>You state that it is claimed by Brazil that a number of its citizens were
                        impressed in 1880 into the military service of the Republic of Uruguay, and
                        that the government of the former country is not satisfied with the inquiry
                        made and action taken in regard to the matter, by the government of that
                        republic; and you also state that, as Uruguay is in debt to Brazil, it may
                        elect to cancel the obligation by a cession of territory to Brazil, and that
                        the day may come when that republic will make such a proposal, in view of
                        which possibility you apprehend it to be a question of no slight moment how
                        far the President of the United States ought to acquiesce in a voluntary
                        transfer, by an American republic, of its domain to a monarchical power. You
                        close your dispatch by saying that, although the occasion may not arise for
                        the consideration of this question, still you will not be surprised if the
                        contrary proves to be true.</p>
                    <p>In reply, I have to state that it is to be hoped that the contingency you
                        fear may not arise. While the United States wish not to encourage any nation
                        in making default in the payment of its debts, this government would be
                        reluctant to see a republic which has a large bonded debt so hand over its
                        territory to a monarchy that the government of the same would cease to be
                        republican.</p>

                        <p>The document which is published in the present number gives an account to
                            the public of the result of the projected Congress of Panama, which
                            should have been inaugurated in that city on the 1st of December of the
                            past year, according to the invitation directed with this object by the
                            United States of Colombia.</p>
                        <p>The government of General Barrios, understanding that peace is the great
                            necessity of the American republics, overrun with wars which nearly
                            always were without reason or object, had accepted the invitation thus
                            opportunely sent, and fulfilling the obligation which voluntarily it had
                            desired to accept, accredited in due form the citizen who ought to
                            represent it. But the generous proposition to establish arbitration as a
                            principle of American public right, and to proscribe war, with its sad
                            train of calamities and misfortunes, from the beautiful continent of
                            Columbus, was defeated for the time being. Nevertheless it is not
                            necessary to be discouraged. The grand ideas which bring with them the
                            seed of a profound transformation and improvement for the peoples are
                            immortal, and must succeed sooner or later, although they may have to
                            encounter obstacles opposed to their propagation and increase which, for
                            the moment, appear insuperable. Humanity never loses sight of them, and
                            when the propitious moment arrives, avails itself of, and obtains from
                            them, all the fruit they are destined to produce.</p>
                        <p>This reflection is suggested to us by the circumstance that the
                            Government of the United States of North America has just addressed,
                            through its respective ministers, an invitation to all the independent
                            governments of America to take part in a general peace Congress, which
                            will meet in the city of Washington in the month of November of
                            1882.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Guatemala immediately, and with the greatest
                            enthusiasm, accepted this new invitation; and it is certain that,
                            partaking of the initiative of the great nation called upon to sustain
                            and lend such great services to the liberty of other countries of
                            America, the generous impulse of peace will now go forth from the sphere
                            of beautiful ideals to convert itself into a beneficent reality,
                            fruitful for all Latin-American countries in precious guarantees of
                            tranquillity and respect for right.</p>
                        <p>The note in reply to the invitation of the Government of the United
                            States is a frank manifestation of the particular principles which the
                            Government of Guatemala professes, and an unequivocal demonstration of
                            those sentiments of admiration, sympathy, and respect which that
                            extraordinary people inspire, without example in history, who, at each
                            step, make the most valiant and surprising conquests in politics,
                            industry, arts, and in all branches of progress and. civilization.</p>
                        <p>Abounding in the same sentiments expressed in the note referred to, we
                            can say that all America is to be congratulated. Soon, very soon, that
                            Congress, which cannot fail to realize its objects, because the idea
                            proceeds from a nation of unbreakable energy, which without receding
                            marches ever forward in all it undertakes, will be a work that will
                            honor America and all humanity, and will figure without comparison among
                            the greatest and grandest events of this century.</p>
                        <p>We also send our most cordial felicitations to the Government of the
                            United States of America, because it will be the one that realizes that
                            magnificent and consolatory theory of peace, inasmuch as it was
                            reserved, without doubt, to the greatest people to bring to a
                            culmination the greatest idea.</p>
                        <p>The endeavors which some other nations of America have made, pursuing
                            that ideal, are certainly laudable, but it becomes necessary to confess
                            that the undertaking is of such magnitude, that it has not yet had a
                            champion who, under all circumstances, might be able to sustain it
                            without bending under its weight. To-day it is the great Colossus of the
                            American continent, which takes upon itself the realization of that
                            brilliant and philanthropic thought, and equal as it is to the magnitude
                            of the idea, the greatness of the people which is its powerful
                            sustainer, assures us, without doubt, that we are now upon the eve of
                            those fortunate days in which the tree of peace will extend its shade
                            over all the American peoples; in which only the respect for right will
                            reign, and in which war will not return to visit these regions which for
                            so long a time have suffered from its ravages.</p>
                        <p>Our conviction is that not one of the Latin-American powers will refuse
                            to proceed promptly to the rendezvous which gives promise to realize the
                            generous purpose which has inspired the invitation which occupies our
                            attention, nor fail to be worthily represented in that great Congress of
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Guatemala felicitates itself that to the United States shall belong the
                            glory of acquiring so splendid a conquest, and that the nation which has
                            shown itself so great in war, so great in work and in industry, so great
                            in its organization, in its principles and institutions, so great in all
                            that is civilization and advancement, shall be equally great in bringing
                            to its consummation a work which must figure as one of the most
                            beautiful pages in her brilliant history, because it will be of the most
                            transcendental importance to the cause of America, and of all
                            humanity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 18th of the present month I received a
                        telegram in the following words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Senate Committee on Foreign Relations have adopted an amendment to
                                bill incorporating the Maritime Canal Company and make eleventh an
                                objectionable clause subject to any sovereign rights of the
                                Government of Nicaragua.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In reply I have to say that not having been furnished with a copy of the bill
                        incorporating the Maritime Canal Company, my only knowledge of its
                        provisions is derived from articles published upon it by El Mensajero of
                        Costa Rica, and El Porvenir of Nicaragua. The article in the latter sheet
                        contains, and comments upon, the eleventh clause referred to in your
                        telegram; but it is evident either that there is a mistake about it in
                        Nicaragua or that the clause or section has been altered by the company from
                        the original draft. The article in El Porvenir is very severe upon those
                        features of the bill which bear upon the question of the imperiled
                        sovereignty of the republic, while it would appear from your telegram that
                        the United States Senate does not consider the bill <pb n="35"
                            xml:id="pg_35" facs="0107"/>to go far enough in that direction. There is
                        a conflict here which, without the bill before me, I am unable to
                        reconcile.</p>
                    <p>El Porvenir article takes the strong position that the company’s concession
                        had lapsed, and that it should not and could not legally be extended. It
                        declares the pretension of the United States to sovereignty over the canal
                        route to be of a piece with the similar pretension in reference to Colombia,
                        and that it will neither be tolerated by the people of Nicaragua nor the
                        powers of Europe with which the country has treaties. This paper has no
                        official character, and its declarations are not of very great
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>A brief review of late events will place you in knowledge of the present
                        situation in Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>Paragraph 3, of Article 47 of the concession, stipulates that the
                        concessionees shall have two years time from May 29, 1880, in which to form
                        the company, make the surveys, and begin the work. The expiration of that
                        period being close at hand. Capt. E. P. Lull was sent out as a special
                        commissioner to solicit an extension of the time. He arrived in Managua, the
                        capital of the republic, on the 8th of February ultimo. Having satisfied the
                        government, an Executive decree was issued extending the stipulated time to
                        the 30th of September, 1884. This decree was ratified by the Senate on the
                        23d of February; by the house of Deputies on the 24th, and received the
                        Executive signature the same day. Having accomplished the purpose of his
                        mission Captain Lull left Nicaragua on the 24th ultimo, and as he did not
                        communicate with this legation during the time he was in the country, I
                        infer that he went away entirely satisfied.</p>
                    <p>There is one condition made by the Government of Nicaragua upon which the
                        extension is based, and which must be accepted by the concessionees within
                        four months to make it valid. The concession provides in Article 14 that the
                        canal company shall construct a canal, within three years from the date of
                        the concession, between the lake of Managua and the navigable part of the
                        river Tipitapa. This part of the concession was not extended. The government
                        is to have the privilege of cutting the referred-to canal at once, with
                        funds from the general treasury; but it is to receive from the concessionees
                        the sum of $200,000 in cash, to cover the outlay therefor. A contract for
                        doing this work has already been let to the French contractor, A. P.
                        Blanchet. As involving no concession to the contractor, the canal company’s
                        rights cannot be interfered with, especially as they are fully protected in
                        them by their concession.</p>
                    <p>The Nicaraguan Congress adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi> on the 11th
                        of the present month without further action in reference to canal matters
                        than as above stated.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Under cover of this dispatch, I inclose a copy
                        of the Gaceta Oficial of Nicaragua, of March 11 ultimo, which contains the
                        contract of that government with Monsieur A. P. Blanchet. I also inclose,
                        marked No. 2, a translation of the same, which, having been hastily made to
                        catch the mail, may contain some unimportant errors.</p>
                    <p>My dispatch No. 280 informs you of the execution of this contract. A careful
                        reading of Articles 25 and 27 will show you that the rights of the American
                        Company have been expressly guarded. For your fuller understanding of the
                        matter, I make a brief <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> as follows: Article
                        14th of the American concession stipulates that the company shall construct
                        a canal of certain dimensions between the lake of Managua and the navigable
                        part of the Tipitapa River, within the term of three years from the
                        beginning of the interoceanic canal work. Upon the completion of this short
                        canal, the government is to take possession of the work, and thenceforward
                        pay all expenses of maintenance, operation, &amp;c., while the American
                        Company is to have the unrestricted right of free use during the life of
                        their concession.</p>
                    <p>When the American Company failed to begin the work within the specified time,
                        and it became apparent that the concession was about to lapse, the
                        Government of Nicaragua began to cast about for means to canalize the
                        Tipitapa River, which connects the lakes of Nicaragua and Managua. The
                        deepening and widening of this river, now too shallow for navigation, would
                        insure interoceanic communication through Nicaragua. Small vessels could
                        ascend, it is claimed, the San Juan River from San Juan del Norte on the
                        Atlantic, and passing through the above-named lakes by the canalized river
                        would reach the small port of Leon Viejo, on the western shore of Lake
                        Managua. From thence there is soon to be completed railroad communication to
                        the port of Corinto on the Pacific.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0109"/>
                    <p>The government could hardly be blamed for wishing to accomplish an end of
                        such importance, and preliminary negotiations had been had with Monsieur
                        Blanchet for the construction of the canal before the late visit of Captain
                        Lull to Nicaragua. When the latter arrived, he found no difficulty in
                        getting an extension of the original concession, modified, however, as
                        stated to you in my No 280. The sum of $200,000 stipulated by the government
                        is ostensibly for the purpose of meeting the expense of a repurchase from
                        Blanchet.</p>
                    <p>However, as you will perceive, the American concession is carefully protected
                        in the Blanchet contract, so that no prejudice to American interests can
                        result therefrom.</p>

                            made in good faith by the company in the administration of the canal,

                            the company.</p>
                        <p>In this case the decision shall be given by three arbiters, constituting
                            a majority of votes, with or without fresh information.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatches Nos. 202 and 203 to Mr. Logan,
                        the latter dated April 13, have been received at this legation.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the dispute between Guatemala and Mexico on the subject of
                        boundaries, which is the subject of your No. 202, I have the honor to
                        inclose certain documents which may give you some information of the state
                        of affairs here. No. 1 is a translation of a note from the Mexican minister
                        here to the Guatemalan minister of foreign relations, and No. 2 is the
                        answer of the latter. These translations were very hastily made, but I think
                        they will be found to be substantially correct. * * *</p>
                    <p>A few days after this correspondence President Barrios sent a message to the
                        Assembly, asking for full powers to arrange the boundary question with
                        Mexico as he thought best. His request was granted in a decree of which the
                        following is a translation: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I have just received two copies
                            of the report presented by your excellency to the legislature last
                            month; which document I have read attentively, giving special attention
                            to the portion referring to the relations between Guatemala and Mexico.
                            Speaking of the question of boundaries, your excellency says that, “<hi
                                rend="italic">It is believed with sufficient reason that before the
                                termination of the year the said question may be completely and
                                satisfactorily arranged, it being impossible for the Government of
                                Guatemala to have any other aspiration than that of maintaining its
                                rights, and that the territory legitimately belonging to the
                                republic may not be dismembered, for whose integrity it has to watch
                                according to the fundamental law.</hi>” Your excellency also
                            expresses your opinion that all the charges made against the Government
                            of Guatemala in the report which the secretary of state and of the
                            department of foreign relations of Mexico remitted to the Congress of
                            the Union of my country, the 10th of last September, “<hi rend="italic"
                                >are absolutely destitute of justice.</hi>” That the government of
                            which your excellency forms part is pleased that Mexico recognizes the
                            judicial fact that the Uriarte-Vallarta convention has legally expired;
                            “and that the President of the republic does not remember having
                            proposed that a new convention be made with the intention of reviving
                            the former ones.” Finally, your excellency, penetrating into the
                            slippery region of suppositions, affirms that, “<hi rend="italic">it is
                                hidden from no one, that if it were sufficient that the federal
                                Government of Mexico should declare, upon its own authority, that to
                                it belonged any part whatever of the territory of Guatemala, the day
                                that it should be pleased to declare that the whole extent of the
                                republic belonged to it, your excellency’s government would have to
                                acknowledge that resolution, and to recognize the legitimacy of the
                                title which it would create, or else to give an offense which would
                                necessitate a reparation.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>I wish that your excellency’s hope that during the present year the
                            question of boundaries may be terminated in a satisfactory manner may as
                            soon as possible be an accomplished fact, because the desire, of my
                            government in regard to the affair is: that the dividing line between
                            the two republics be fixed, perfectly determined, in order that there
                            may be no room for doubts, and that the vexatious difficulties which are
                            making themselves felt may be avoided.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency’s report to which I refer contains asseverations which
                            affect the good name of my country, and it may be necessary that they be
                            removed, I remit to my government a copy of the said document; but this
                            does not prevent me from fulfilling the duty of expressing in the
                            present note my dissent from the facts and appreciations (?) given by
                            your excellency, in order that at no time consequences may be deduced
                            from my silence. I permit myself to rectify only the most important
                            errors.</p>
                        <p>Although it cannot be considered as a serious hypothesis that it could
                            occur to Mexico to declare of its own authority that all the Republic of
                            Guatemala belonged to it, taking into consideration the elevated
                            character and illustriousness of the functionary who formulates it, I am
                            obliged to inform him that there is no fact authorizing a supposition of
                            such a nature.</p>
                        <p>Mexico, Mr. Minister, prides herself on nothing so much as on her never
                            deviating from rectitude; my country does not need nor wish for foreign
                            territories; she possesses sufficient territory for a population ten
                            times greater than that she has, and if your excellency will please to
                            read the declarations that, competently authorized, are made by the
                            editor of the Diario Oficial of the Government of the United Mexican
                            States, in No. 59 of this periodical, dated the 10th of last month (of
                            which I take the liberty of inclosing a copy), you will be convinced of
                            the truth stated.</p>
                        <p>It is certain that the Government of Mexico recognizes that the effects
                            of the convention of December 7, 1877, and those of its prorogation of
                            May 3, 1879, legally ceased on account of the termination of the first
                            period stipulated in the last, without the commission of experts having
                            finished its labors in the first section of the frontier line, and as
                            the Most Excellent President of this republic does not remember, as your
                            excellency says, having proposed that a new convention be made, with the
                            intention of reviving the former ones, I am able to clear up that
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>In a note dated June 25, 1881, I had the honor to inform, among other
                            things, the department under your very worthy charge, as follows: An
                            incident which concerns the minister of foreign affairs of my country,
                            in the note which causes this answer, is not referred to by your
                            excellency in your very esteemed note which I have the honor to answer,
                            and it is the fact that the undersigned, by order of his government, had
                            the honor to insinuate to the Most Excellent President of this republic
                            the convenience of celebrating a new convention, which should revive
                            that of December 7, 1877, and that, having received such insinuation
                            favorably, the First Magistrate himself dictated his agreement, that it
                            might be transmitted to the minister of Guatemala in Mexico, in order
                            that the treaty might be celebrated; and that Señor Herrera had not <pb
                                n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0116"/>informed the department of
                            foreign relations of Mexico that he was authorized to that effect.” And
                            the 29th of the same month, Dr. Lorenzo Montufar, in his character of
                            secretary of foreign relations, which he was then, had the kindness to
                            answer me, among other things, as follows: “Instructions were sent to
                            Señor Herrera, that <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> he address
                            himself to the secretary (department) of state of the Mexican Republic,
                                <hi rend="italic">with the end of entering into negotiations over
                                the new convention</hi> referred to in your excellency’s esteemed
                            note, which I answer to-day.”</p>
                        <p>In consequence, when the secretary of foreign relations of Mexico stated
                            in the report of last September that the Most Excellent President of
                            this republic had accepted the proposition which the Mexican Government
                            made him, through me, to revive the said conventions, he expressed a
                            truth entirely indisputable.</p>
                        <p>Before closing, will your excellency permit me to express my surprise to
                            see expressed, in the document to which I refer, that: the Government of
                            Guatemala <hi rend="italic">is pleased that Mexico recognizes the
                                juridical truth that the Uriarte Vallarta convention has legally
                                expired</hi>, because this manifestation of pleasure contrasts with
                            that of the desire which your excellency says the government has to come
                            to a prompt and complete arrangement of the question of boundaries, when
                            the scientific investigations stipulated in the said convention must
                            have been exceedingly useful, furnishing the data necessary for its
                            greater exactness.</p>
                        <p>Although at the risk, Mr. Minister, of abusing your excellency’s
                            kindness, I permit myself to ask you to be pleased to insert this
                            dispatch in the Guatemalteco, providing there should be no
                            objections.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I have attentively studied the
                            esteemed communication which your excellency was pleased to address me
                            under date of yesterday, with the object of expressing your dissent to
                            certain statements and observations contained in the last report made to
                            the Legislative Assembly, and of rectifying the principal errors which,
                            in your excellency’s judgment, are contained in the portion referring to
                            the relations between Guatemala and Mexico, in the said document, which
                            for my part I also took care should reach your excellency’s government.
                            I might, from this moment, abstain entirely from entering into
                            discussion concerning the statements and observations contained in the
                            said report; and so doing, would do no more than imitate the conduct
                            which, in a recent and analogous occasion, the secretary of state of the
                            Republic of Mexico saw fit to observe, when our minister addressed him,
                            expressing the astonishment caused him by certain words used by the
                            President, in giving an account to the chambers, on the 16th of
                            September last, of the state of the relations between Guatemala and
                            Mexico. The answer which that elevated functionary gave him was, that
                            without establishing a promiscuous precedent, the documents issued by
                            the executive, in conformity to a constitutional requirement, to inform,
                            not foreign countries, but the representatives of the nation, of its
                            political state, although they might be given the greatest publicity for
                            the information of the latter, could not be taken as a theme of
                            discussion with foreign ministers, because they are acts of interior
                            polity, although they may be found to contain references to exterior
                            affairs. Without prejudice of the right to make use of this example,
                            nevertheless, I do not make use of it now, through deference to your
                            excellency, and because I do not wish to deprive myself of the pleasure
                            of giving you an answer, rectifying in my turn the errors into which it
                            appears to me you have fallen. The report presented to the Assembly does
                            not say, nor could it say in any part, that it is believed that Mexico
                            is going to declare, of her own authority, that all the Republic of
                            Guatemala belongs to her, nor does it say in any part that there is a
                            presumption that such a thing will happen, or that there are facts which
                            authorize that presumption or suspicion. The report only says, if your
                            excellency will permit me to recall it to you, “<hi rend="italic">that
                                referring to the reclaim for the invasion of Tonintana, the
                                representatives of Mexico stated to this department that his
                                government denied the satisfaction asked, because it had declared
                                that that territory teas part of the Mexican soil, and had given him
                                orders to so communicate it.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>It says “<hi rend="italic">that on our part it was answered that Mexico
                                was not competent authority to make a declaration of that nature,
                                because the party himself interested in a question cannot be
                                competent to decide it, and because nations cannot make themselves
                                by their own authority, and by the title of their sole declaration,
                                owners of a territory.</hi>”</p>
                        <p>It says “<hi rend="italic">that in spite of this the reclaim of the
                                Government of Guatemala was not attended to,</hi>” and it says
                            finally, to demonstrate roughly to what point the consequences might
                            come, if one nation had to abide by the declarations made by the other
                            in disputed <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0117"/>matters, that “<hi
                                rend="italic">it is hidden from no one, that if it were sufficient
                                that the Federal Government of Mexico should declare upon its own
                                authority that to it belonged any part whatever of the territory of
                                Guatemala, the day that it should be pleased to declare that the
                                whole extent of the republic belonged to it, my government would
                                have to acknowledge that resolution, and to recognize the legitimacy
                                of the title which it would create.</hi>” I have not penetrated
                            then, Mr. Minister, into the. slippery region of supposition, because I
                            have not said nor believed that that would happen, as 1 have not been
                            able to believe nor say that Guatemala would ever agree to a resolution
                            to this effect. The only thing I have wished to do, and have done, is to
                            make manifest how iu admissible and absurd it would be to recognize in
                            one of the contending parties the right to itself determine the question
                            by means of the declarations it should see fit to make, imposing them
                            upon the other as obligatory. For this purpose I have made use of a
                            style of argument, very well known, which is that of pointing out the
                            extremes to which the logical application of a principle would lead, in
                            order that its falsity might be recognized, by all who could see the
                            impossibility of accepting its consequences. Your excellency knows
                            perfectly that certain inflexible principles of justice are neither more
                            nor less in” small things than in great. If a nation once believes
                            itself to have the right to decide for itself that a span of territory
                            which it disputes with its neighbor belongs to it, with the same right
                            it could decide afterwards that it owned an immense territory which
                            might be the matter in dispute. If in a question between two individuals
                            for a few cents one of them could constitute himself judge, there would
                            be no reason why he should not constitute himself judge in the same
                            manner when the question might be for many millions of dollars. But as
                            it frequently happens that, when treating of the relatively
                            insignificant, all the importance of fixing an unsustainable principle
                            is not clearly seen, it becomes necessary to apply that same principle
                            to a greater extent and to present all that would happen in that case,
                            that there may be no doubt that the principle should be repulsed,
                            although in the very insignificant and small. They are, therefore, as I
                            conceive, two things very different, to suppose, that is to say believe
                            or presume, that a certain thing is going to happen, and to only feign
                            the hypothesis that it might happen, in order to calculate the
                            consequences of a principle. I agree perfectly with your excellency that
                            it cannot be believed or seriously presumed that it could occur to
                            Mexico of her own authority to declare that all the Republic of
                            Guatemala belongs to her, but exactly the circumstance that that deed
                            gives force to the argument presented to the Assembly, choosing the most
                            unrealizable hypothesis, that is to say, demonstrating the inexactitude
                            of a principle by means of the absurd consequences, that would have to
                            be derived from the application of it. Referring to the remarks which
                            your excellency is pleased to make respecting the fact that the
                            President of this republic does not remember having proposed that a new
                            convention be made with the object of reviving those of December 7,
                            1877, and March 3, 1879, I must inform you that this affirmation
                            contained in the report, in virtue of data furnished me by the
                            President, is in no wise opposed to what my predecessor said to you, on
                            the 29th of June of the last year, about sending instructions to the
                            minister of Guatemala with the object of entering into negotiations
                            concerning the new convention to which your excellency refers, for
                            continuing the study of the frontiers. It has not been said that a new
                            convention is not desired or has not been authorized, because, as the
                            report itself says, even without it no difficulty has been raised to
                            prevent the Mexican engineers from continuing their labors in the
                            territory of Guatemala: and furthermore, although it were unnecessary,
                            there was no objection whatever to a convention limited exclusively to
                            that, unless it should offer to reproduce some of the inadmissible
                            provisions contained in the first. It was said, then, that there would
                            be no objection to making a new convention, which should have the same
                            object of continuing the study of the frontier, but not exactly a new
                            convention in terms leaving subsistent the same ones of the first,
                            which, as is mentioned in the report, encountered opposition in the
                            council of state, and even among some of the members of the Guatemala
                            cabinet, who were not inclined to ratify it, and it was only approved by
                            the President of the republic acceding to the request of the
                            representative of Mexico, who assured him that that convention had no
                            other object than that of a simple reconnoissance. I believe I am able
                            to remove the surprise which your excellency has experienced at the
                            contrast which you have judged to exist between the manifestation that
                            the Government of Guatemala is pleased that Mexico recognizes the
                            juridical fact that the Uriarte-Vallarta convention has legally expired,
                            and the expression of the desire, which the government asserts itself to
                            have, of coming to a prompt and complete arrangement of the question of
                            boundaries. I have not been able to find the difference of meaning
                            between the two declarations, which your excellency supposes. The
                            Government of Guatemala is pleased that Mexico recognizes the expiration
                            of the Uriarte-Vallarta convention, because this having expired
                            according to its judgment, as it declared to the Assembly, it is natural
                            to be pleased that the Government of Mexico, with which it was
                            celebrated, shares in the same opinion, so that the two are agreed on
                            that point. It is pleased that this expiration is recognized, because if
                            the convention has no other <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0118"
                            />object than the study or reconnoissance of the frontiers, it is
                            entirely unnecessary, seeing that this can be done by means of simple
                            notes, and that it is being done even without them, and because, if it
                            have any ether object aside from this, as was presumed from the terms in
                            which it was expressed by the individuals of the council, and those of
                            the cabinet, who opposed its ratification, that peril is avoided,
                            without prejudice to the making, if it were believed indispensable, a
                            convention actually limited to its proper object. Therefore, the
                            complacency that that convention, as it was conceived, has expired, and
                            the sincere desire which animates my government that a prompt and
                            complete settlement of the question of boundaries be reached, are
                            perfectly reconcilable. If, in order to reach if, there are any
                            scientific studies which it may be indispensable or useful to make,
                            nothing opposes their being made, if it were agreed to make them, and
                            this were convenient, but without the terms and agreements of the
                            Uriarte-Vallarta treaty being reproduced in the convention, but that it
                            be made in terms which offer no difficulty, and be limited to providing
                            that the studies and reconnoissances required be made. Under the
                            condition of frankness which presides over my relations with your
                            excellency, and of the publicity which my government wishes all acts
                            which interest the country to have, I have no objection to complying
                            with your excellency’s desire, that the dispatch which I answer be
                            inserted in the official periodical, to which I promise to send, in the
                            future, reclamations and other matters, which, from their nature and
                            importance, may opportunely be brought to the knowledge of the

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: This government has received
                            information that General Don J. Rufino Barrios, President of this
                            Republic, has left the United States of America to travel in Europe.</p>
                        <p>During all the sojourn of the meritorious General Barrios in the Great
                            Republic of the North, he has been the subject of marked attentions and
                            of unequivocal proofs of deferent consideration on the part of the
                            government of the country you worthily represent.</p>
                        <p>The free institutions, the marvelous greatness, and the immense
                            development of the American nation are on an elevation with the energy
                            of its citizens, and of the enlightenment of its government; for these
                            reasons, the manifestations made to General Barrios have profoundly
                            excited the gratitude, not only of the government but of the people of
                            Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>I have therefore the honor to request that you will be pleased to express
                            to your government how great are the obligations this republic
                            entertains for the kind attentions shown to its chief.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your instruction No. 4 of
                        the 9th ultimo, relating to the postponement of the Congress of American
                        States which it was proposed to hold in Washington on the 19th of November
                        of the present year, I have to inform you that, in accordance therewith, I
                        have delivered to the minister for foreign affairs of Guatemala, and have
                        forwarded to each of the ministers for foreign affairs of the other states,
                        a copy of the instruction referred to. My communications to Honduras,
                        Salvador, and Nicaragua, respectively, were addressed on the 9th, and to
                        Costa Rica on the 19th instant, after I had forwarded my credentials as
                        reported in my No. 17. Copies of these communication^ are transmitted
                        herewith.</p>
                    <p>Although it was well understood by the Government of Guatemala that the
                        proposed Congress of American states would not be realized, the minister for
                        foreign affairs expressed great regret that a project of such vital
                        importance, to the Central American States especially, should have failed
                        even temporarily. He could but express the hope, however, that the project
                        would be revived at no distant day, and that under the auspices of the
                        United States it would be successfully carried out.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Through the medium of this legation the
                            President of the United States, some months since, extended to the
                            several governments of the Central American republics an invitation to
                            be represented in a general Congress of American states, which it was
                            proposed to hold at Washington City in November, 1882. The invitation
                            was addressed to your excellency on the 4th January last, and under date
                            of the 20th February your excellency communicated the acceptances of His
                            Excellency the President <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0120"/>of
                            Honduras, and at the same time expressing a high appreciation of the
                            humane object and elevated purposes of the proposed Congress. In that
                            invitation the confident hope was expressed that, by the remote date
                            fixed for the meeting of the Congress, all conflicting questions between
                            the republics of the southern continent would have terminated, and that
                            all would be able to participate in its discussions. Unhappily, that
                            peaceful condition, contemplated as essential for carrying out
                            successfully the object of the proposed Congress, does not exist. These,
                            and other reasons which are set forth in the accompanying copy of a
                            communication from the Secretary of State, by whose instruction I have
                            the honor to transmit it to your excellency, have constrained the
                            President to postpone the projected meeting until some future day.</p>
                        <p>I would respectfully invite the attention of your excellency to that part
                            of the Secretary’s communication in which is expressed the belief of the
                            President, that the fact of such a Congress having been called has not
                            been without benefit; in this belief I am persuaded the government of
                            your excellency will concur.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Through the medium of this legation, the
                            President of the United States, some months since, extended to the
                            several governments of the Central American republics an invitation to
                            be represented in a general Congress of American states, which it was
                            proposed to hold in Washington on the 22d of November next. That
                            invitation was communicated to your excellency on the 4th January last,
                            and its receipt was acknowledged under date of 14th February; I find no
                            other communication on the subject from your excellency on the files of
                            this office. The Secretary of State no w instructs me to inform the
                            governments of the Republics of Central America that the meeting of the
                            projected Congress has been postponed until some future day. The reasons
                            therefor are set forth in the accompanying copy of his dispatch of the
                            9th ultimo, addressed to this legation, and which by his instruction,
                            also, I have the honor to transmit to your excellency.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: For several months past the government of
                        Guatemala has been receiving information of projected invasions of its
                        territory by expeditions of armed forces, having for their object the
                        enticing or compelling the inhabitants of the frontier, who are mostly
                        Indians, into subscribing or adhering to public acts of annexation to the
                        bordering States of Mexico; it is said that those expeditions have been
                        preparing in Campeche, Yucatan, Tabasco, and Chiapas. The first of these
                        invasions has taken place during the present month in the department of
                        Peten; all the information in regard to it, thus far received, is contained
                        in the accompanying copies of dispatches and letters to the minister of war
                        of Guatemala, and which have been received during the past week. For
                        convenient reference I inclose a tracing from an authentic map, showing what
                        is believed to be the correct boundary lines between Mexico and Guatemala,
                        and the location of the towns said to have been invaded, as well as those
                        which are mentioned in the inclosures.</p>
                    <p>The first information comes from the alcalde of an Indian town named
                        Silvituk. As well as can be made out, from a letter dictated by a person who
                        can neither read nor write, it appears that the place was invaded, and that
                        the inhabitants were compelled to go to the village of Tenchac and there
                        declare their adhesion to Campeche. He charges, also, that deception was
                        practised upon them by a priest named Bersunea, “who told them that the
                        Republic of Guatemala was taken.” This priest is a native of Campeche, and
                        is well known to the Guatemalan government.</p>
                    <p>The several communications embraced in the inclosures are numbered from 1 to
                        5. Nos. 2 and 3 are translations of dispatches from the military commandant
                        of Peten to the minister of war,- they report the fitting out of an
                        expedition in Tabasco, with the knowledge and consent of the governor, for
                        the invasion of that department; that one commercial firm has given therefor
                        the sum of $5,000, and another has contributed 60 Winchester rifles5 that
                        the expedition would be sent by steamboat from Tabasco to a place called
                        Tonosique, on the Umacinta River, six days from his headquarters. He reports
                        also the invasion of the towns of San Antonio and Concepcion. The remaining
                        letters and telegrams merely corroborate the general news of the invasion.
                        This affair has given the Government of Guatemala a vast deal of trouble and
                        anxiety, besides the expenses which it can illy afford to incur, of sending
                        500 troops from Coban to the frontier. I have time only by this mail to
                        communicate the facts, and to say that the government is reluctant to
                        believe that the Government of Mexico has any knowledge of these hostile
                        movements. At the earnest solicitation of the President of Guatemala, I
                        cabled to you on the 26th the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>President Orantes has information of invasion of Guatemalan districts
                                Concepcion and San Antonio by Mexican troops, compelling inhabitants
                                to declare for annexation to Campeche. President hopes invasion not
                                authorized by Mexico. Five hundred troops sent to invaded districts.
                                I apprehend hostilities may ensue unless Mexicans retire.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>No suggestion of any action in the premises on your part has been made; it
                        was desired only that the Government of the United States should be advised
                        of these movements.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I send this for your information, having
                            received no reply to a dispatch I sent making known to you that forces
                            were coming from Campeche to take possession of these places, which was
                            carried out. A commission having been sent, they made us go down to
                            Tanche (Tenchac) to subscribe to an act of adhesion of these towns to
                            Campeche. Finding ourselves without resources for resistance we had to
                            yield, but we offer not to take up arms against that department. This
                            happened through the deceptions of the Curate Bersumsa, who told us that
                            the Republic of Guatemala had been taken and that we could not resist a
                            state like Campeche. Hearing this we were afraid, and we told them to
                            continue, that we could not, inasmuch as we had taken an oath (to
                            Guatemala probably), but afterwards we learned that you had sent
                            circular orders, and these papers were taken in Tanche (Tenchac) and we
                            had no knowledge of the orders which you sent us. Besides this, orders
                            have been given to collect provisions for the troops that are going to
                            Concepcion, or for your headquarters, I am not sure which.</p>
                        <p>This is all I have to make known to the respectable headquarters.</p>

                            you the news given me by a merchant who has just arrived from Tabasco.
                            He says that in the capital of that state, with the knowledge and
                            permission of the governor, a party of bandits is being formed to come
                            and rob the department; that the house of Bulues &amp;; Company has
                            given them $5,000, and the house of Valenzuela, 60 Winchesters; that
                            sixty persons were ready who were expecting to complete the number to
                            one hundred, to go out; they will come to Tenocique in a steamer of the
                            house of Bulues; that place is not more than six days from here.</p>
                        <p>Many of these rogues have been woodcutters in this department; have
                            failed and wish to retrieve their fortunes by robbing and pillaging. The
                            person who has given me this news is very respectable, and from the
                            names of the individuals he mentioned, and whom I know, I believe it,
                            because they are bandits capable of anything that is bad, and one of
                            their pranks is to ruin the house of Jumet and Sastre to which the
                            Bulues are in hostility.</p>
                        <p>I will do everything possible not to be surprised, and will defend myself
                            to the last. I have no other arms than 25 Remingtons, second class. I
                            have therefore asked for 25 of first class, and I again ask you most
                            earnestly to send them to me immediately with corresponding ammunition.
                            With fifty men well armed I will teach these bandits a lesson.</p>

                            the alcalde and governor of the town of Silvituk (see No. 1), in which
                            he communicates to me that the towns of the district of San Antonio have
                            been invaded by forces from Campeche, who drew up acts in those towns
                            annexing them to Campeche. Besides this, I have news that in the town of
                            Concepcion, near the boundary of Campeche (state of), and 112 leagues
                            from here, there are two hundred troops of Campeche that are preparing
                            to march on these headquarters. * * * * *</p>

                        Telegraph Company was laid in August last, and was opened to public service
                        on the 1st instant. Its connection with this capital is through the
                        neighboring Republic of Salvador; although it was at first, comtemplated,
                        and a contract to the effect between the Government of Guatemala and the
                        company was entered into for the establisment of a station at the port of
                        San José</p>
                    <p>As a matter which possibly may interest you, and for future reference, I

                        letter of the agent of the company, Mr. Stanley McNider, in which he
                        communicates to the government the reasons which constrain the company not
                        to land their cable at San José, and only at the port of La Libertad in the
                        Republic of Salvador, which is in telegraphic communication with Guatemala;
                        as also the arrangements she has made with that government in regard to the

                        <p>The Government of the Republic of Guatemala, represented by its
                            consul-general in New York, the Hon. Jacob Baiz, duly authorized to that
                            effect, and the Central and South American Cable Company, represented by
                            James A.Serymser, its president, have entered into the following

                            Guatemala:</p>
                        <p>The Republic of Guatemala authorizes the Central and South American Cable
                            Company to establish in the waters of the republic, one or more
                            electro-magnetic submarine cables, to connect the coasts of Guatemala
                            with those of the Republic of Mexico <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52"
                                facs="0124"/>on the North, and those of the Republic of Central
                            America and Colombia, on the South at such points as may be judged most
                            advisable by the said company, the latter having entered into an
                            agreement with the Mexican Cable Company for the transmission over their
                            lines of all messages to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Central and South American Cable Company shall have also the right of
                            building a land line of telegraph to connect the end of their cable to
                            the telegraphic station nearest to its landing, said complementary land
                            line to be used exclusively for the service of the company and the
                            transmission of cable messages, and to enjoy all the rights, immunities,
                            privileges, and exemptions conceded by this contract to the Central and
                            South American Cable Company.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Second. Said company is authorized to at once make the necessary
                                surveys for the laying of the submarine cable, and to place the
                                same, with its accessories and dependencies, such as stations,
                                wires, instruments, &amp;c., &amp;c., within the dominion and
                                jurisdiction of the Guatemalan Republic, and to adopt the plan of
                                operation which the company may decide upon. With this object, said
                                company may employ the engineers, agents, workmen, ships and means
                                of transportation, which, for whatever purpose, it may have in its
                                employ. The route may be changed, but the necessary notification
                                must be given the office of the secretary of public works of the
                                Guatemalan Republic.</item>
                            <item>Third. The government of the republic cedes gratuitously to the
                                company the lands which belong to the nation, and which it may need
                                for the establishment of the termini of the cable, stations,
                                offices, stores, and warehouses. It also cedes to the company the

                                republic which may be necessary for the establishment of the cable.
                                As regards the lands and water belonging to private individuals
                                which may become indispensable for the completion of the work, the
                                cable company is hereby authorized to have them expropriated on
                                grounds of public utility, in accordnace with the laws of the
                                republic.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. The company is at liberty to select its employés,
                                engineers, and mechanics, and the administration and management of
                                the undertaking shall at all times belong completely to it. The
                                government of the republic is nevertheless free to establish at its
                                own expense agents who will have the right to inspect the books and
                                accounts of the company, and who will inform the government of the
                                state of the company’s transactions.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. The employés and workmen of said company, no matter what
                                their nationality may be, not excepting citizens of the Republic of
                                Guatemala, shall be exempt from all military and public duties
                                whilst in the employ of the company.</item>
                            <item>Sixth. During the term of fifty years the Government of the
                                Republic of Guatemala will deliver, and cause to be delivered, to
                                the Central and South American Cable Company, when the lines of said
                                company are available for transmitting the same, all telegrams
                                originating or proceeding from within the jurisdiction of the
                                Republic of Guatemala destined for foreign countries, whenever such
                                telegrams can be transmitted to their destination by the Central and
                                South American Cable Company and its connections, as speedily and as
                                cheaply as by any other company or route. During the term of fifty
                                years the Central and South American Cable Company shall enjoy all
                                the telegraphic and other privileges that may be granted to the most
                                favored party or parties, company or companies, by the Government of
                                Guatemala for telegraphic purposes.</item>

                                is hereby bound to deliver to the telegraph offices of the
                                government of the republic, or at the points of connection, all the
                                telegraphic dispatches that It may receive over its cable for any
                                point in the Republic of Guatemala.</item>
                            <item>Eighth. The maximum of the tariff which the company may charge for
                                each word sent over the cable shall not exceed seventy-five cents in
                                United States gold coin, between the terminus of the cable in
                                Guatemala and any point in the United States of America, including
                                the charges on all the intermediate telegraph lines; subject to the
                                foregoing conditions, the arrangement of the tariffs shall be left
                                exclusively with the Central and South American Cable Company,
                                which, together with the secretary of public works, shall fix the
                                rules relative to the form and transmission of messages.</item>
                            <item>Ninth. Besides the agent or representative which the company must
                                have in the city of Guatemala, to transact business with the
                                government of the republic, it may establish in the cities which it
                                may think proper, and where there are government or other telegraph

                                for transmission by the cable to points outside of the republic,
                                adding thereto in the collection the rates of transmission of
                                telegrams over the wires of the general government, which stipulates

                                from time to time charged for any like telegrams, whether through or
                                local, over the national wires.</item>
                            <item>Tenth. All messages relative to the service and management of the

                                charged over the said cable.</item>
                            <item>Eleventh. All payments for telegrams shall be made in United

                                each month a balance shall be struck of what each party is to pay
                                the other for messages which have been delivered to it for
                                transmission, said balance to be paid at the end of each month
                                following the liquidation. In this must also be considered the
                                amounts that the company may have collected in the places where
                                agencies of the company may have been established in accordance with
                                the ninth clause of this contract.</item>
                            <item>Twelfth. The establishment of the submarine cable having been
                                declared by the Government of Guatemala a work of public utility,
                                the exportation of the coin (moneys) which the company may have
                                collected for the transmission of messages shall be free of all
                                duties. The telegraph materials, whether national or foreign, which
                                may be necessary for the construction of the company’s work and
                                equipments of offices and warehouses, and also the apparatus for the
                                establishment of the submarine cable, and the connecting land lines,
                                referred to in article first, shall be free of all kinds of import
                                or custom-house dues, of excise duties, contributions, or taxes,
                                decreed up to the present, or that may hereafter be decreed by any
                                authority of the republic, no matter what the nature, denomination
                                and object of said taxes, may be, for the term fixed in the sixth
                                clause of this contract.</item>
                            <item>The cable employed in the construction and establishment of the
                                line, as also the shares which may represent it, shall be exempt
                                from the payment of all established contribution or taxes, or from
                                such as may hereafter be established, during the term fixed in the
                                above sixth clause.</item>
                            <item>Thirteenth. The company will be empowered to associate itself with
                                any other company, and to transfer or alienate all its rights,
                                privileges, property, and obligations fixed in this contract. In
                                this case the company, of which the present may form part, or
                                association which may he substituted to it, shall enjoy all the
                                rights and privileges herein granted, and for the same reasons will
                                be bound to all the obligations and agreements contracted by the
                                Central and South American Cable Company.</item>
                            <item>Fourteenth. Any and all doubts or difficulties which may arise in
                                reference to the meaning or execution of this contract, between the
                                Government of the Republic of Guatemala and the Central and South
                                American Cable Company, or the person or association that may be
                                substituted to it, shall be decided by arbitration, each of the
                                parties naming an arbitrator, who together shall have, power to
                                appoint a third as umpire, and in the event of this failing to
                                arrive at a decision, then by the tribunals of the republic, in
                                accordance with its laws.</item>
                            <item>Fifteenth. This concession shall become void for the following
                                causes: <list>

                                    <item>In case that within one year from the date of the

                                        the company shall not have notified it that the necessary
                                        surveys have been made for the establishment of the cable
                                        determining its position.</item>

                                    <item>For not beginning within eighteen months from such date of

                                        thereafter. These terms may be extended by proving that
                                        causes beyond control have delayed the execution of the
                                        work, in which case the time that the impediment has lasted
                                        shall be credited.</item>
                                    <label>3d.</label>
                                    <item>On account of any interruption of over one year’s duration
                                        in the use of the cable between Guatemala and the nearest

                            <item>Sixteenth. The government of the republic stipulates and agrees

                                or laws, which may exist in contradiction to the concessions made in
                                the present agreement.</item>
                            <item>Seventeenth. At the expiration of the fifty years referred to in
                                the sixth clause of this contract, the company, or its assigns, will
                                continue in possession of its cable, and the privilege of
                                transmitting telegrams on the same terms as enjoyed by
                                others.</item>

                                Minister of Public Works.</hi></head>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            president of the Central and South American Telegraph Company has
                            instructed me to communicate to you his determination to locate the
                            cable of the company at the port of La Libertad, Republic of Salvador,
                            instead of the port of San Jose’, of the republic, as it first
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The obstacles to an efficient working of the cable in the said port (San
                            José) are of such a serious nature that after a careful study of the
                            causes, made with the object of overcoming them, if possible, it has
                            been found, as the result of all the measures suggested, that there is
                            too much uncertainty of success to warrant the company in risking the
                            landing of the cable in that port. While the president of the company
                            deplores the unavoidable circumstances which prevent the establishment
                            of a station at San José, it is satisfactory to him to be able to
                            designate the advantages which are offered to the telegraphic line of
                            Guatemala by the contract made by the company with the Government of
                            Salvador, in article No. 12, a copy of which I have had the honor to
                            send you. The president of the company is equally pleased to state that
                            notwithstanding the extra work on the cable caused by the station of La
                            Libertad, he has determined not to vary the tariff of the company from
                            the stipulated prices for San José, it being understood that the
                            improved form of the contract with Salvador is approved of by this
                            government, and that it will be of full force in this republic, and
                            especially the substance of the said article 12.</p>
                        <p>As it appears impossible to notify all the stations of foreign countries
                            that the official dispatches of the Government of Guatemala enjoy a
                            reduction of 50 per cent, on passing over the company’s lines, I am
                            instructed to say that if the government will be kind enough to order a
                            monthly detailed statement to be taken of the official dispatches
                            received by it from its representatives in foreign countries, the
                            company, after verifying the account, will cancel and reimburse it for
                            the said sum of 50 per cent, on all such dispatches.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that the cable of the company will be open for public service
                            by the end of the present month, at which time it will offer special
                            facilities to the government of this republic to enjoy the utilities
                            offered by the use of the service.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you of our arrival
                        at this place. Leaving Aspinwall yesterday by special train, we reached
                        Panama in the afternoon, and went at once on board of the Lackawanna, which
                        will be ready to go to sea to-morrow morning.</p>
                    <p>It is scarcely necessary, but it only seems proper to say that we were
                        received by Captain Wilson with cordiality, and every possible preparation
                        has been made for our comfort.</p>
                    <p>There is of course no information of interest in connection with the objects
                        of the mission to communicate from this point. The rumors of occurrences in
                        Peru are almost as vague and contradictory here as at home, and all that we
                        have heard goes to show a continued condition of uncertainty as to whether
                        there is any government in Peru.</p>
                    <p>I inclose the latest issue of the Daily Star and Herald, containing <pb
                            n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0127"/>the proclamation of what would seem
                        to be a sort of provincial dictatorship by General Carceres, and both in
                        Spanish and English a communication by Mr. Hurlbut to the notables of Lima,
                        whoever they may be. All accounts seem to agree that Pierola has abandoned
                        his claims to executive power, and the last report is that he has left the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>I beg to call to your attention that the mail contained no communication
                        either to General Hurlbut, General Kilpatrick, or Mr. Adams, instructing
                        them as to the purpose or authority of the special mission. For reasons
                        which are obvious I do not desire to submit to them my own instructions, and
                        there may be some embarrassment should they, in the absence of instructions,
                        decline to recognize the transfer of the negotiations to the special
                        mission.</p>
                    <p>I know that such instructions were prepared, and I am confident that they
                        were signed and ready for transmission. If they have been intentionally
                        withheld I feel very sure that I would have been so informed, and I hope
                        that you will agree in the conclusion to which I have come, that it is my
                        duty to act as if they had been sent, and, if necessary, to furnish these
                        gentlemen with copies of such portions of my own instructions as specify the
                        duties and the extent of the authority confided to me.</p>
                    <p>Referring also to your verbal instructions, that I should take charge of the
                        invitations to the Governments of Chili, Peru, and Bolivia to be represented
                        at the proposed congress in Washington, and deliver them to the respective
                        governments at such time as the circumstances of the anticipated negotiation
                        seemed to render most opportune, I beg to inform you that the mail contains
                        no such communications, and it will occur to you without suggestion from me
                        that if at some later date these invitations are transmitted to the
                        ministers at Lima, Santiago, and La Paz, they should be instructed not to
                        present them without my knowledge and approval.</p>
                    <p>Their delivery might, under circumstances by no means improbable, cause very
                        serious embarrassment in the conduct of the special mission with which I
                        have been charged. A reference to my instructions will, I think,
                        sufficiently explain my meaning.</p>
                    <p>I consider this so important that I have deemed it proper to telegraph you
                        the fact that these instructions have not been sent, in order that by the
                        next mail I may know whether they have been intentionally kept back, or
                        that, in case of accidental omission, they may be supplied.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                                military chief of the central departments, to the people and the
                                army of his district.</hi></head>
                        <p>The self-sacrificing army of the center, which has been unable to view
                            with indifference the political movement made by those of the south and
                            of the north, has just joined in that undertaking, and declared
                            unanimously and spontaneously, its determination no longer to
                            acknowledge the authority of Dr. Nicholas de Piérola. It has, moreover,
                            proclaimed me as the Chief Magistrate of the nation, charging me to
                            carry out its views, by prosecuting the war until a peace is concluded
                            with the enemy which will guarantee the honor and the autonomy of the
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>This declaration, which has been inspired by a feeling of the loftiest
                            patriotism, seeks the accomplishment of no purpose save the complete
                            unification of public sentiment, and the removal, with a firm and
                            resolute hand, of every obstacle likely to prevent so desirable a
                            consummation. Since the power wielded by Dr. Piérola has become an
                            element of discord, which causes the continuance of anarchy in the
                            country, to <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0128"/>put it down is to
                            consult the great interests of our native land, and to save them, by a
                            united effort, from the international conflict which seriously menaces
                            them.</p>
                        <p>In seconding by my acquiescence the patriotic attitude of the army under
                            my command, I do but follow its sound advice, and encourage with the
                            support of my authority its laudable decision in behalf of the sacred
                            duties that are rendered obligatory upon it by the fate of the country,
                            which is condemned to suffer all the hazards of a war as bloody as it is
                            productive of undeserved disaster to the national arms.</p>
                        <p>As to my inauguration as President, I desire that it be sanctioned by the
                            sovereign vote of the people and of the central army, for although my
                            elevation to that high office is a great honor, and a tribute of deep
                            gratitude, it shall never cause me to forget the self-sacrifice with
                            which I have always given my services to my country, nor shall it induce
                            me at once to yield to the seductive temptations of power. In fact, I
                            shall not accept that power save under the seal of popular approval, but
                            shall, in the meantime, confine myself to performing the duties of a
                            superior, political, and military prefect of the central departments,
                            whose generous contributions toward the support of the army renders them
                            worthy of the most enthusiastic applause, and of the gratitude of the
                            nation at large.</p>
                        <p>Soldiers: You, who bear the severest privations in life with a
                            self-denial worthy of the sacred cause which you are defending, because
                            you know that without sacrifices it will be impossible to wash out the
                            stains which are upon the flag that you defend, must not forget that
                            faith and perseverance will triumph, perhaps at no distant day, over the
                            reverses of fortune to which the arms of Peru have been condemned during
                            the war which we are now waging, and remember that, in the midst of
                            adversity and danger, even more than in prosperity, you will constantly
                            be aided and encouraged by your general.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: At your request I make the following
                            declaration: <list>
                                <item>Firstly. The United States of America are firmly in favor of
                                    the cessation of hostilities between Chili and Peru, and the
                                    prompt re-establishment of peace.</item>
                                <item>Secondly. The United States of America decidedly oppose all
                                    dismemberment of Peru, except with the free and full consent of
                                    the nation.</item>
                                <item>Thirdly. They are of opinion that Chili has acquired, as the
                                    result of the war, the right to a war indemnity, and that Peru
                                    cannot refuse such payment.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Government of Chili knows that these are the ideas of the United
                            States, but the divisions which exist in Peru paralyze the good offices
                            of the United States, and give a pretext to Chili to elude the action of
                            the United States in conformity with our desires, and to prolong the
                            state of war and the military occupation of Peru, Chili says, “We also
                            desire peace, but there is no one here competent to arrange it.” This
                            declaration is unfortunately true. For this state of affairs, the only
                            remedy is to be found in Peru itself.</p>
                        <p>Union, under whosoever may be elected, will destroy the pretext of Chili;
                            and give to the United States an advantage which they require and of
                            which they will know how to take advantage. In my opinion nothing else
                            will save the country from an indefinite military occupation by
                            Chili.</p>
                        <p>Peru must save itself, by the sacrifice of personal ambitions on the
                            altar of the redemption of the country.</p>
                        <p>I remain, gentlemen, yours, very truly,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since you received your instructions on your
                        departure as special envoy to Chili, Peru, and Bolivia, I have sent you by
                        cable two instructions. As I have not heard of your having received them,
                        and to make their purport more intelligible than the brevity of a telegram
                        would permit, I send this, stating the proper construction of your original
                        instructions, somewhat modifying them, and indicating how they are to be
                        executed.</p>
                    <p>The President wishes in no manner to dictate or make any authorative
                        utterance to either Peru or Chili as to the merits of the controversy
                        existing between those republics, as to what indemnity should be asked or
                        given, as to a change of boundaries, or as to the personnel of the
                        Government of Peru. The President recognizes Peru and Chili to be
                        independent republics, to which he has no right or inclination to
                        dictate.</p>
                    <p>Were the United States to assume an attitude of dictation towards the South
                        American republics, even for the purpose of preventing war, the greatest of
                        evils, or to preserve the autonomy of nations, it must be prepared by army
                        and navy to enforce its mandate, and to this end tax our people for the
                        exclusive benefit of foreign nations.</p>
                    <p>The President’s policy with the South American republics and other foreign
                        nations is that expressed in the immortal address of Washington, with which
                        you are entirely familiar. What the President does seek to do, is to extend
                        the kindly offices of the United States impartially to both Peru and Chili,
                        whose hostile attitude to each other he seriously laments; and he considers
                        himself fortunate in having one so competent as yourself to bring the powers
                        of reason and persuasion to bear in seeking the termination of the unhappy
                        controversy; and you will consider as revoked that portion of your original
                        instruction which directs you on the contingency therein stated as follows:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>You will say to the Chilian Government that the President considers
                                such a proceeding as an intentional and unwarranted offense, and
                                that you will communicate such an avowal to the Government of the
                                United States with “the assurance that it <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58"
                                    facs="0130"/>will be regarded by the govern merit as an act of
                                such unfriendly import as to require the immediate suspension of all
                                diplomatic intercourse. You will inform me immediately of the
                                happening of such a contingency, and instructions will be sent to
                                you.</p>

                    <p>Believing that a prolific cause of contention between nations is an
                        irritability which is too readily offended, the President prefers that he
                        shall himself determine after report has been made to him whether there is
                        or is not cause for offense.</p>
                    <p>It is also the President’s wish that you do not visit (although indicated in
                        your original instruction you should do so), as the envoy of this
                        government, the Atlantic republics after leaving Chili.</p>
                    <p>The United States is at peace with all the nations of the earth, and the
                        President wishes hereafter to determine whether it will conduce to that
                        general peace, which he would cherish and promote, for this government to
                        enter into negotations and consultation for the promotion of peace with
                        selected friendly nationalities without extending a like confidence to other
                        peoples with whom the United States is on equally friendly terms.</p>
                    <p>If such partial confidence would create jealousy and ill-will, peace, the
                        object sought by such consultation, would not be promoted.</p>
                    <p>The principles controlling the relations of the republics of this hemisphere
                        with each other and with other nationalities may, on investigation, be found
                        to be so well established that little would be gained at this time by
                        reopening a subject which is not novel. The President at all events prefers
                        time for deliberation.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I reached
                        this capital on Saturday, 7th January. On Monday I informed Señor Balmaceda,
                        the secretary for foreign affairs, of my arrival, and was received in public
                        audience by the President this morning at 1 o’clock.</p>
                    <p>I inclose the brief speech which I made on presenting my credentials, and the
                        reply of his excellency the President. They will satisfy you that you need
                        feel no apprehension of any such issue as you suggested in your telegram,
                        which was received by me the day of my arrival at Valparaiso.</p>
                    <p>As the mail closes at 6 o’clock, I am compelled to be very brief, when the
                        condition of affairs really requires a very full explanation.</p>
                    <p>Postponing to next mail a careful appreciation of the very delicate and
                        difficult character of the question with which it has been made my duty to
                        deal, I can only say now that I found here a state of feeling excited far
                        beyond anything that I had anticipated. The popular impression was that I
                        was the bearer of a positive and imperious demand from the United States
                        that Chili should make an immediate peace upon such terms as my government
                        deemed just and proper. And while the Government of Chili did not share in
                        this exaggerated apprehension, there evidently existed in official circles
                        an uneasy uncertainty as to the purpose of the special mission.</p>
                    <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0131"/>
                    <p>I have reason to believe that the remarks which I made at the reception this
                        morning have relieved all apprehension of this sort.</p>
                    <p>I am afraid that it will be more difficult to correct the extravagant hope
                        which exists in Peru of a prompt, and even forcible, intervention of the
                        United States to secure a peace without cession of Peruvian territory.</p>
                    <p>The opinion which I think I am justifled in forming even at so early a period
                        is that Chili really desires peace on what is believed to be fair and
                        necessary conditions, and that the government would gladly find a solution
                        which would relieve it from a prolonged occupation of Peru. But how far I
                        will be able to suggest a method which will conciliate rival interests and
                        susceptibilities I cannot now say. Chili needs peace, but the destruction of
                        the Calderon government and the arrest of Calderon himself have so
                        disorganized Peru that there is no government with which Chili can
                        treat.</p>
                    <p>I am satisfied that the more friendly are our relations with Chili the
                        greater will be our opportunity and ability to serve Peru. And I can very
                        well conceive that the present perplexed condition of the relations between
                        the two countries may render the friendly intervention of the United States
                        desirable to both.</p>
                    <p>After my reception this morning, I told Señor Balmaceda, the secretary for
                        foreign affairs, that if he would accept a suggestion I would propose that,
                        before opening any formal diplomatic correspondence, we should meet
                        informally and have a full and amicable conversation. As I had reason to
                        anticipate, he accepted the suggestion cordially, and I am to meet him at
                        his department on Monday at 12 o’clock.</p>
                    <p>I inclose also a correspondence between Señor Balmaceda and myself, which
                        will explain itself.</p>
                    <p>The matter was perhaps not very important, but under existing circumstances
                        there might have been an intention which it was my duty to notice, and I
                        trust that my action will meet your approval.</p>
                    <p>I ought, perhaps, to add that my reception here, both public and private, has
                        been,courteous and cordial.</p>
                    <p>As the administration removes from this place for the summer to Valparaiso
                        and the adjoining watering-place of Viña del Mar, I will, of course, be
                        obliged to transfer my residence there when they move, which they will
                        probably do some time next week. I have inferred from the telegram received
                        at Panama, informing me of Mr. Blaine’s appointment as chargé d’affaires at
                        Santiago, that it was not the intention of the department to modify its
                        original instructions, and that I would be still authorized, in case of
                        necessity, to charge him with instructions to Lima or La Paz.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">President</hi>: I have the honor to present you
                            my credentials as special envoy extraordinary and minister
                            plenipotentiary from the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The frank and friendly communication with which I am charged will find, I
                            am sure, a ready response at your hands. If recent occurrences have
                            seemed to disturb that loyal confidence which has hitherto marked the
                            relations of the two governments, the President is persuaded that they
                            are due to some unfortunate misunderstanding which need only be clearly
                            stated in order to be satisfactorily corrected. The Government of Chili
                            will not fail to appreciate the natural and deep interest which is felt
                            by <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0132"/>the United States in the
                            prompt and honorable termination of a war between kindred republics; and
                            I trust that your excellency will also feel assured that in no effort
                            which the Government of the United States may desire to make towards so
                            happy a consummation could there exist an intention to suggest any
                            solution which would compromise the honor, endanger the true interest,
                            or wound the susceptibilities of either of the belligerents.</p>
                        <p>I venture to hope that when I am permitted to lay before your excellency
                            the views of the President you will find only an earnest desire for the
                            arrival of that time when the powers now at war will resume their
                            peaceful and prosperous progress; when strengthening themselves they
                            will strengthen each other for the preservation of that system of free,
                            strong, and independent republics which, founded in the traditions of
                            the past, is the glory of the present and the security of the future in
                            both Americas.</p>

                            special envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United

                        <p>You may be assured that in the Chilian Government you will find a sincere
                            and friendly welcome, which will be a merited reply to the loyalty of
                            purpose and sentiments with which personally, and in obedience to your
                            instructions, you come animated.</p>
                        <p>I am fully confident that our friendly relations with the United States,
                            cultivated by both sides with the constant attention that is becoming to
                            two honorable governments, will be maintained unchanged.</p>
                        <p>I esteem as a special proof of the sympathy of the Government of the
                            United States, the natural interest that it manifests for the
                            termination of a war which, unprovoked by Chili, has been brought to a
                            final end by means of vigorous measures, and it is pleasing to me to
                            hear from you that any effort made by the President of the United States
                            for such a purpose, would never involve an intention to suggest any
                            solution that might compromise or endanger the interests, the honor, or
                            the susceptibilities of the belligerents.</p>
                        <p>Chili, an industrious people, that owes its welfare and its progress to
                            peace, and which, beneath its shade, has secured and developed the
                            democratic principles that constitute the immovable basis of the
                            republic, and assure it in the future, could not accept, after the war,
                            a peace that did not comport with its honor or fully secure its
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>I do not doubt but that your mission will fully correspond with the
                            elevated views of the President of the United States. It is also to be
                            expected, on account of your abilities, as well as of your honorable
                            antecedents. You will meet from this government every facility
                            desirable, and I do not doubt but that you will find a cordial and
                            pleasant welcome from Chilian society.</p>

                    <p>After several confidential interviews, Chilian minister for foreign affairs
                        disclaims offending by the removal of Calderon. Will accept good offices,
                        and will facilitate conference between the provisional government of Peru
                        and myself, with the exception of Calderon. Peace on the following
                        conditions: Absolute cession of Tarapacá; and, further, an indemnity of
                        twenty millions, payable in ten years; to occupy Arica positively ten years;
                        the indemnity unpaid, cession to Chili; appropriation of guano at Lobos;
                        Peru refusing no further interference by the Government of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>To offer good offices on the conditions named not according to
                        instructions.</p>
                    <p>I have to suggest, send instructions. Do not interfere on the conditions
                        named. You may recognize the necessity of ceding Tarapacá; if that
                        modification cannot be obtained, carry out your instruction numbered
                        two.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my last dispatch I informed you that the
                        time for a confidential conference with the Chilian secretary for foreign
                        affairs had been appointed. Since then I have had three conferences with Mr.
                        Balmaceda, in which, with entire frankness, we reviewed the existing <pb
                            n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0134"/>condition of our relations in
                        reference to a possible settlement of the terms of peace between Chili and
                        Peru and Bolivia. The result of these conferences I telegraphed you on
                        Monday last, January 23, and I did so not only because instructions were
                        necessary, but because the secretary distinctly informed me that certain
                        contemplated military movements in Peru were suspended, in hopes that
                        through the good offices of the United States some practical solution might
                        be found. I could scarcely expect such a suspension to be prolonged through
                        the two months (and perhaps more) which would be occupied in the
                        transmission of my dispatch and the receipt of a reply. And I think it is
                        evident that not only the interests of the belligerents but the position of
                        the United States require a prompt decision as to the extent to which the
                        government will further intervene in this matter.</p>
                    <p>I think the conditions imposed by Chili are hard. I am not at all sure that
                        any representation by the United States will induce Peru to accept them.
                        Chili not only desires, but needs peace. The occupation of Peru is a very
                        heavy drain upon her population, and although its immediate expenses have so
                        far been borne by Peru, the resources of Peru cannot long stand such an
                        imposition, and the cost of the continued occupation and the further
                        military operations which must be undertaken will then have to be defrayed
                        by Chili. Peru may prefer to wait until these embarrassments develop rather
                        than to cede territory at present, but I ought not to conceal from you my
                        conviction, which at present I can only state to you as a conclusion without
                        the reasons, that Peru is powerless to help herself. There is no government
                        and very little prospect of the establishment of a stable one, and her power
                        of military resistance to the Chilian forces anywhere seems absolutely
                        null.</p>
                    <p>Without the intervention of the United States Chili can, and will, compel
                        Peru to accept any terms she may choose to impose, or she will define her
                        military occupation to suit her plans of annexation and leave the rest of
                        Peru to anarchy.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that the terms of peace, which I sent you by telegram, may be
                        modified at the earnest remonstrance of the United States. I have very
                        little doubt, not only from what I learn here, but from recent dispatches
                        from Mr. Adams, that Bolivia is willing to make peace at the cost of her
                        littoral on the Pacific. This, with the cession of Tarapacá, is ample
                        indemnity and security for Chili. The imposition of twenty millions more
                        upon Peru as indemnity and the prolonged occupation of Arica seem to me to
                        be very extreme conditions.</p>
                    <p>But the cession of Tarapacá is unavoidable, unless the United States means to
                        intervene forcibly, and in the present condition of Peru such an
                        intervention would have to be undertaken by the United States, with no
                        assistance from Peru herself which would be worth considering.</p>
                    <p>It is under these circumstances that I suggested that I should be-allowed to
                        recognize the necessity of that cession and offer the good offices of the
                        United States if the other terms were modified. It is unquestionably
                        important to Chili to obtain a peace, and the good offices of the United
                        States will relieve the embarrassment in the way created by the arrest of
                        Calderon and the disorganized condition of the Peruvian Government. The
                        government of Montero, or anybody else which would make peace, through the
                        United States, would be recognized.</p>
                    <p>But it is difficult to say how far the recommendation of the United States
                        would now be received by any government in Peru. The action of Mr. Hurlbut,
                        whether intentional or not, has so exaggerated the belief in the Peruvian
                        mind of the certainty and efficacy of the intervention <pb n="63"
                            xml:id="pg_63" facs="0135"/>of the United States to prevent any cession
                        of territory, that I am not prepared to say that any Peruvian Government
                        will he willing or strong enough to accept such terms, and Chili naturally
                        expects that if she accepts our good offices we will, upon failure of a
                        satisfactory result, refrain from any further interference.</p>
                    <p>In all this I have assumed that the government has not yet considered the
                        possibility of a forcible intervention on behalf of Peru, and in my telegram
                        I intended to convey the idea that, in my opinion, some modification of the
                        terms may yet be reached which would allow the United States to recommend
                        their adoption to Peru.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On Thursday, January 26, 1882, I sent you a
                        telegram requesting that neither any of General Kilpatrick’s dispatches nor
                        my instructions be published.</p>
                    <p>The reasons for the telegram are these:</p>
                    <p>In the first interview with Mr. Balmaceda, I called his attention to certain
                        dispatches from Mr. Christiancy, Mr. Osborn, and General Kilpatrick,
                        informing their government of the wish and purpose of the Chilian Government
                        to establish and strengthen the Calderon government in Peru.</p>
                    <p>General Kilpatrick’s dispatches went further, and assured the Department that
                        both the late and present Chilian Government were prepared to conform to the
                        wishes of the United States, give the Calderon government a cordial support,
                        and make no demand for cession of territory until full opportunity had been
                        given to Peru to pay an adequate indemnity.</p>
                    <p>The secretary appeared a good deal surprised when these dispatches were read,
                        and said that while he was unauthorized to say what had passed between
                        General Kilpatrick and the late government, he could certainly say that no
                        communication on the subject had ever taken place between himself and
                        General Kilpatrick.</p>
                    <p>Some days after he called on me, and said that he would like to address me a
                        confidential note in reference to Kilpatrick’s dispatches, but as the
                        General had detailed private conversations with very prominent and
                        distinguished officials, which they wished to contradict, he did not desire
                        that his letter should be published, and this would be obligatory upon him
                        if these dispatches of General Kilpatrick were published in the United
                        States. I thought his suggestion judicious, for the reason that I had had
                        the opportunity of learning somewhat of the conference to which General
                        Kilpatrick refers. In his dispatch he alluded to a gentleman of great
                        consideration, a member of the Chilian Congress, a very distinguished
                        lawyer, who had held cabinet position, and who has been remarkable for the
                        moderation of his views in regard to the settlement of the terms of peace.
                        He attributes to this gentleman a large <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64"
                            facs="0136"/>part in the conference and its results. The gentleman to
                        whom I refer assured me that so far as he was present or informed, General
                        Kilpatrick’s statements were calculated to give an entirely erroneous
                        impression of what had occurred, and the detail which he gave me satisfied
                        me that the officials to whom General Kilpatrick referred would contradict
                        his most positive assertions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balmaceda admitted that the dispatch was sufficient to justify the action
                        of the United States, and in correcting it he was anxious to avoid an
                        unpleasant issue as to the correctness of the statements of one who was now
                        dead, and whose long and painful illness was a sufficient explanation of any
                        misconception of facts into which he may have been led.</p>
                    <p>As the papers just received contained the publication of a large portion of
                        the correspondence with our ministers at Lima and Santiago, and as further
                        publication seemed to be expected, he expressed a wish that I would
                        telegraph. I included my instruction in the request, as a large portion of
                        General Kilpatrick’s dispatch is incorporated in it. Of course the secretary
                        did not ask that my instructions should not be published, as he has not seen
                        them, and did not know what they contained. But to make the two requests
                        separately would have increased considerably and unnecessarily the cost of
                        the telegram.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, while I do not doubt that a controlling necessity of
                        which I am not informed, required in the discretion of the Department the
                        recent publication of much of its correspondence with the United States
                        ministers at Lima and Santiago, I ought to say that the publication has not
                        helped me.</p>
                    <p>The dispatches have all been republished here, with the editorial comments of
                        the home papers, and the impression has been unfortunately made that the
                        administration had some policy which had excited strong popular opposition,
                        and that the government found itself compelled to explain away what was
                        deemed objectionable. The inference drawn from this is that I am not
                        empowered to take anything like strong or positive action in reference to
                        the settlement of the terms of peace. I need not add that some uncertainty
                        on the part of the Chilian Government, as to the extent to which the United
                        States were prepared to go, until in the natural development of the
                        negotiation it was officially informed, would not have been without its
                        influence in recommending a reasonable modification of the terms.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I ask to call your attention to a circumstance
                        which may create some embarrassment in the negotiation here.</p>
                    <p>When I was about leaving Washington the Secretary of State informed me
                        verbally that the President had decided to invite a congress of the North
                        and South American powers to meet at Washington, and (as I understood) that
                        the invitations to the Governments of Chili, Peru, and Bolivia would be
                        placed in my hands to be delivered under such <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65"
                            facs="0137"/>circumstances as would not interfere with the progress of
                        the present negotiation.</p>
                    <p>These invitations have been sent to the respective ministers accredited to
                        these governments. I think you will appreciate the impossibility of
                        tendering such an invitation to Chili until the result of the negotiation
                        has ascertained our friendly relation. It would be exceedingly unfortunate
                        if either Mr. Hurlbut or Mr. Adams should deem it incumbent upon them to
                        extend this invitation to Peru and Bolivia, while it was not extended to
                        Chili. I have written to both of these gentlemen, asking that they would
                        take no action until after consultation with me. While I hope that they will
                        recognize the propriety of this request, I cannot be sure that they will
                        regard this invitation as belonging to the duties attached to the special
                        mission, and they may, perhaps, regard its communication as belonging to the
                        ordinary duties of the resident legation, with which I am not authorized to
                        interfere.</p>
                    <p>I have not deemed it judicious to make any reference to it here, for I am
                        apprehensive that the Chilian Government might construe it into a threat of
                        an appeal against its proceedings, especially if I am finally compelled to
                        carry out instruction No. 2.</p>
                    <p>I have as yet no reason to suppose that the Chilian Government is informed of
                        the invitation, but as it has been already communicated to some of the
                        governments, it cannot be long before it is generally known. If the
                        instructions which I receive in reply to the telegram enable me to negotiate
                        a modification of the terms of peace which can be recommended to Peru, I
                        shall have no hesitation in communicating to the Government of Chili the
                        purpose of the United States.</p>
                    <p>But if, unfortunately, that should not happen, and the United States should
                        be compelled to withdraw its offer of good offices, it will be equally
                        difficult to communicate the invitation or to withhold it.</p>
                    <p>In the first case the expression of our grave disapprobation of the refusal
                        of moderate terms of peace may irritate the Chilian Government to a point
                        that may lead to its refusal, putting aside the apparent inconsistency on
                        our part of the two proceedings. While in the latter case the omission of
                        Chili will be so marked as almost to necessitate the withdrawal of the
                        Chilian minister from Washington and the consequent interruption of our
                        friendly relations.</p>
                    <p>I cannot expect to receive instructions on this subject in time to be
                        relieved from the responsibility which the circumstances may impose upon me,
                        but I trust the Department will appreciate the difficulty in which such a
                        contingency may involve me.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Department’s instructions
                        numbered 15 and 17, addressed to Mr. Kilpatrick, I have the honor to inform
                        you that, in accordance with the permission given in a letter received from
                        Mr. Trescot, a copy of which you will receive as an inclosure to his
                        dispatch numbered 8, I availed myself of the interview appointed by Mr.
                        Balmaceda, secretary of state for foreign affairs, with Mr. Trescot, and,
                            <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0138"/>with the latter’s permission,
                        accompanied him to Mr. Balmaceda on Tuesday last, the 31st ultimo.</p>
                    <p>After some remarks upon other topics by Mr. Balmaceda, Mr. Trescot stated to
                        him the object for which I had come, saying to him: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>You are doubtless aware, sir, of the friendly interest which the
                                United States has for some time manifested in endeavoring to procure
                                a concerted system of action on the part of the powers of the
                                western continent which might lead to some united policy on their
                                part tending to the perpetuation of peace, the avoidance of
                                international wars, and possibly the settlement of disputed points
                                by arbitration. During the past year the United States has been
                                appealed to by Guatemala to exert its good offices in settling the
                                question of boundary existing between Guatemala and the neighboring
                                Republic of Mexico; it has been requested by Venezuela to assist her
                                in regulating the question of her debt to foreign countries, and I
                                venture to also call to your recollection the happy influence
                                exerted by our ministers to Chili and to the Argentine Republic in
                                aiding the two governments to harmoniously decide a question of
                                boundary, which seemed, at one time, to threaten serious
                                consequences. I mention these facts as showing the spirit in which
                                the United States proffers the invitation, for the purpose of
                                presenting which on the part of his government Mr. Blaine has
                                accompanied me this morning. The invitation is dated in November,
                                1881, and the date of the congress is fixed for November of the
                                present year. I desired, however, before permitting the presentation
                                of the invitation to Chili, to make sure that the invitations to
                                Bolivia and Peru were presented to those governments at the same
                                time, as, if such an invitation should be presented to one
                                government and not to either of the others, such a fact might, in
                                the present condition of affairs between the three republics, lead
                                to misunderstanding. The letter addressed to General Adams,
                                instructing him to invite the Government of Bolivia, was among the
                                intercepted dispatches which came into my hands last week. As I am
                                now assured that the letter will reach General Adams, and, as I am
                                informed that Mr. Hurlbut has received the invitation for Peru, I
                                have told Mr. Blaine that I thought it best that the invitation
                                should now be given to your government. That the proposed congress
                                has no bearing upon the question of existing hostilities you will
                                see when Mr. Blaine shall have read to you the invitation.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>To this Mr. Balmaceda replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The subject of a conference of American nations, both including and
                                without the United States, has been brought to the attention of my
                                government by the United States of Colombia some time since, and on
                                other occasions. My government has never yet decided as to what
                                course it would pursue with reference to such matters, and I cannot
                                give any answer without first consulting my government. May I ask
                                what is the full purpose of this Congress.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>To this Mr. Trescot replied that no answer would at this time be expected
                        from the Government of Chili; that I was prepared to leave a copy of the
                        invitation; that the government might take the question into consideration,
                        and that the question as to the object of the proposed congress would be
                        best answered by permitting me to read the invitation.</p>
                    <p>This I was about to do, when Mr. Balmaceda said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>It would, perhaps, be better not to deliver the invitation, as I have
                                received telegraphic information that the Government of United
                                States has abandoned this proposed congress—</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">and then went on to give further details of his knowledge as
                        to the action of the United States, which it is unnecessary for me to
                        repeat, as they referred to other matters, and are fully set forth in Mr.
                        Trescot’s dispatch of this date, numbered 8.</p>
                    <p>I could not but think that it was possible that the secretary might have been
                        misinformed, but concluded that it was best not to further press the matter.
                        The fact that the United States had proposed such a congress had been
                        brought to his attention, and if, Mr. Balmaceda’s information proving
                        incorrect, I should hereafter be instructed to deliver the invitation, the
                        delay in delivering it cannot create embarrassment, as I have desisted from
                        now delivering it at his own request.</p>

                    <p>This action, of which I had been so apprehensive, rendered it necessary that
                        the invitation should also be extended to Chili, for I had no doubt that the
                        fact would be published in the Lima papers. And by the last mail from Lima,
                        I find that not only the fact but the invitation in full has been
                        published.</p>
                    <p>I therefore wrote to Mr. Adams, at La Paz, and to Mr. Blaine, who is <hi
                            rend="italic">chargé d’affaires</hi> here, to say that I desired them to
                        consider my request for delay in the presentation of the invitation as now
                        withdrawn. These letters, with one to Mr. Hurlbut in reply to his
                        information, will be found in inclosures numbered 1, 2, and 3.</p>
                    <p>As an interview with the secretary for foreign affairs had been appointed for
                        Tuesday last (January 31), Mr. Blaine accompanied me, in order to read the
                        invitation in conformity with his instructions.</p>
                    <p>Our interview had been arranged for the purpose of comparing our respective
                        drafts of a protocol summarizing the substance of our former confidential
                        conferences, a proceeding to which the secretary seemed to attach
                        considerable importance. After reading over Mr. Balmaceda’s draft in
                        Spanish, and receiving a copy for more careful consideration, I explained to
                        him the purpose of Mr. Blaine’s visit. To my great surprise, he expressed
                        the wish that Mr. Blaine would not read the communication, and then, turning
                        to me, he said, “It is useless. Your government has withdrawn the
                        invitation.” Seeing, I suppose, an expression of astonishment, which I did
                        not pretend to conceal, he added, “Your own instructions have been changed.
                        Your instructions from Mr. Blaine have been published, and others are on
                        their way to you modifying your original instructions in very important
                        particulars. The whole question about Calderon is out of the way, and you
                        are told to be entirely neutral.”</p>
                    <p>I replied, “I do not understand that there is any such thing as a Calderon
                        question between us,” and then said, “Do you mean, Mr. Secretary, that both
                        my original instructions and the instructions from the present
                        administration are published?”</p>
                    <p>He said, “Yes, before you have received them I have a telegram, not in
                        cipher, but open,” to which I replied that I supposed so, because I could
                        not see the use of a cipher dispatch in referring to papers already
                        published.</p>
                    <p>He added, “Yes, they have been published, and will be soon published here in
                        La Patria” (a newspaper). He then went out of the room and returned with a
                        telegram, which, he said, had come from Paris only two days before, and of
                        which he read me the first line, which, as I recollect, was, “The
                        Blaine-Trescot instruction has been published,” and then paused, smiling and
                        looking over the telegram, as if he were uncertain whether he should
                        communicate the rest. I said, “As you say that all this is confidential,
                        don’t make a half confidence of it. If I am to receive my instructions
                        through you let me know them in full.” He <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68"
                            facs="0140"/>smiled, shook his head, and folded up the telegram, saying,
                        “This, however, will not interrupt our negotiation,” and then proceeded, at
                        some length, to state why and to explain what he considered the advantages
                        of the condition of things under the new instructions.</p>
                    <p>I said to him, “That may all be so, Mr. Secretary, but I think that a
                        diplomatist of ordinary experience would conclude, when he learns that his
                        instructions have been communicated to the government with which he is
                        negotiating, before he receives them himself, that it is time for him to be
                        silent until he does receive them. I think there must be some mistake about
                        all this, but at any rate I must decline to say a word more until I learn
                        from my government what it has done and what it means me to do.”</p>
                    <p>He said that he hoped that I would receive my instructions very soon; that
                        the position was strained and could not be maintained for an indefinite
                        time, that is, Chili could not wait much longer for the United States to
                        decide what action it would take, and then, for the first time in our
                        conferences, his manner became excited and his language somewhat too
                        demonstrative. “Since you have been here,” he added, “two occurrences have
                        taken place which I am sure are disagreeable to you as they are to Chili.
                        Mr. Hurlbut has refused to consent to the export of certain goods from the
                        blockaded port of Mollendo, unless we will consent to the import of coal, an
                        article contraband of war, tor the use of the railroad, and although we have
                        a right to disregard his refusal, we have not done so. And secondly, Mr.
                        Adams, in Bolivia, has addressed a letter to the government at La Paz,
                        advising them of your mission, and endeavoring to induce them not to make a
                        separate peace before Peru has effected some arrangement, and I do not know
                        how long Chili can bear such interference.”</p>
                    <p>I said, “Mr. Secretary, the facts which you state are grave, so grave that
                        even in the most confidential conversation I will not express an opinion
                        unless you communicate them to me officially; then I will meet the questions
                        you raise.”</p>
                    <p>He said, “I have no intention of doing so; I did not even intend to draw a
                        confidential answer from you.”</p>
                    <p>There the interview ended.</p>
                    <p>The facts of Mr. Hurlbut’s action, as I have heard them, are these: At the
                        blockaded port of Mollendo, on the Peruvian coast, there has been a large
                        accumulation of produce waiting for exportation. An application was made by
                        Mr. Adams, without consultation with Mr. Hurlbut, to the Chilian authorities
                        in Lima for license to certain mercantile firms, German, I believe, to take
                        out their goods. Fearing that such permission might be considered as an
                        abandonment of the blockade, the Chilian authorities asked the consent of
                        the diplomatic corps in Lima to the issue of the license. Mr. Hurlbut
                        replied that the only American interest in Mollendo was the railroad from
                        Mollendo to Puno, and if that corporation were allowed to import the coal
                        and supplies necessary for its wants he would consent.</p>
                    <p>You will observe that these facts, if correct, furnish ground for a very
                        different estimate of Mr. Hurlbut’s action than that made by the secretary
                        for foreign affairs. But as I had no official information, either from Mr.
                        Hurlbut or from the Chilian Government, I deemed it injudicious to enter
                        upon any confidential discussion of the subject.</p>
                    <p>As to Mr. Adams there has been a general impression here that Bolivia had
                        consented or would consent to a separate peace with Chili, by which, in
                        exchange for her littoral territory upon the Pacific, she would be
                        indemnified by some cession of Peruvian territory. When Mr. Adams returned
                        to La Paz he communicated the purpose of the special <pb n="69"
                            xml:id="pg_69" facs="0141"/>mission to the government, and did, I
                        believe, succeed in inducing them to suspend any such action until it could
                        be ascertained if the good offices of the United States could effect a
                        general and satisfactory solution. In this I conceive that Mr. Adams was
                        only acting in the line of his duty, but I did not deem it proper to discuss
                        it in a confidential or informal way, for reasons which I think will be
                        obvious to you.</p>
                    <p>Having thus given you a concise account of the interview, you will allow me
                        to express the hope that my conduct will be approved. My original
                        instructions were in the alternative, and if I failed to obtain such a
                        settlement as the President deemed he had a right to expect, I was directed
                        to take certain action, which could not have been agreeable to the Chilian
                        Government. I could not suppose that such an instruction would be made
                        public while I was endeavoring to secure, and not without some hope of
                        success, the amicable solution of this delicate and difficult question.
                        Still less could I believe that if my original instructions had been
                        seriously modified any communication of such change would have been made to
                        the public, or even confidentially to the Chilian Government, before I could
                        possibly have received it. I could not admit, what the Secretary’s
                        conversation clearly implied, that I did not represent the wishes or
                        intention of my government, and that he was better instructed than myself as
                        to the purposes of my mission.</p>
                    <p>But as his language and action were evidently based upon his confident
                        knowledge of these supposed instructions, any further conference with him
                        was useless until I heard from the Department.</p>
                    <p>As both the telegram which I received upon my arrival at Valparaiso, and that
                        of the 10th of January, which reached me only on the 31st ultimo, the
                        translations of which are herewith inclosed, indicated the propriety of very
                        great caution in the execution of my original instructions, and as my
                        telegram of January 23, stating the terms upon which Chili would accept the
                        good offices of the United States, and a reply to which was absolutely
                        necessary for any further negotiation, has not yet been answered, I have
                        determined to do nothing whatever until the receipt of instructions from the
                        government.</p>

                            dispatches which had been intercepted, I called your attention to that
                            one in which you were instructed to convey to the Government of Bolivia
                            the invitation from the President of the United States to that
                            government to send representatives to the proposed peace congress at
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>In doing so, I asked you to suspend action upon this instruction until
                            you heard further from me on the subject. In the mean time I have been
                            informed by Mr. Hurlbut, the minister of the United States at Lima, that
                            he received similar instructions, and has already communicated them to
                            the Government of Peru. He does not say to whom he has communicated
                            them, as the representative of that government.</p>

                            communication of Mr. Hurlbut, it renders necessary the communication of
                            the invitation to the other powers.</p>
                        <p>You will therefore consider the request for delay which I made you as now

                            from the Department, upon the receipt of which I will write you

                            withhold for the present the invitation from the President of the United

                            congress at Washington are known to you.</p>

                            request was made of Mr. Hurlbut, at Lima, and Mr. Adams, at La Paz.</p>
                        <p>I have received from Mr. Hurlbut a communication under date of January
                            18, in which he informs me that he has already communicated this

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge your communication
                            of January 18, in which you inform me that you have received and
                            communicated to the Peruvian Government the invitation from the
                            President of the United States to the proposed peace congress in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances under which I asked that you would suspend action upon
                            this instruction until after consultation with me were these:</p>
                        <p>When I was about leaving Washington I was informed by the Secretary that
                            such an invitation would be issued, indeed that it had already been sent
                            to Mexico and Guatemala. I understood that the invitations to Chili,
                            Peril, and Bolivia were to be sent through me to be delivered as the
                            circumstances of the anticipated negotiation seemed to render
                            opportune.</p>
                        <p>Not finding any such instructions, I telegraphed and wrote from Panama,
                            saying in my dispatch of December 12, “I beg to inform you that the mail
                            contains no such communication, and it will occur to you without
                            suggestion from me that if at some later date these invitations are
                            transmitted to the ministers at Lima, Santiago, and La Paz they should
                            be instructed not to present them without my knowledge and approval.
                            Their delay might, under circumstances by no means improbable, cause
                            very serious embarrassment in the conduct of the special mission with
                            which I have been charged. A reference to my instructions will, I think,
                            sufficiently explain my meaning.”</p>
                        <p>The difficulty which I anticipated must, I think, have occurred to
                            you.</p>
                        <p>I could not with any fitness extend this invitation to the Chilian
                            Government until I had ascertained what were the relations between us.
                            If the negotiations should terminate in failure, disturbing the amicable
                            relations between us, the invitation would be either offensive or idle;
                            Chili might, if irritated by the position of the United States as
                            defined in my instruction, construe it to mean an appeal to the public
                            opinion of the American republics against her. But still more important
                            was it that this invitation should not be communicated to Peru and
                            Bolivia without at the same time being communicated to Chili.</p>
                        <p>My hope therefore was that Mr. Adams and yourself would wait until the
                            time came when the invitation could be properly extended to Chili. I
                            thought it not improbable that you would consider the instructions sent
                            you in reference to the special mission as sufficiently indicating that
                            all questions bearing upon this very delicate and difficult negotiation
                            were to be left to my discretion.</p>
                        <p>But if your instructions did not in your opinion bear this construction,
                            I felt sure that you would, at my request, co-operate with me in such a
                            line of conduct as, in my judgment, seemed necessary here. I can only
                            regret therefore that my request reached you too late, and after you had
                            carried out your instructions as you understood them.</p>
                        <p>The communication of the invitation to Peru of course now renders it
                            absolutely <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0143"/>necessary to extend
                            the invitation to Chili at once, and I have so informed Mr. Blaine, to
                            whom, as the successor of General Kilpatrick, the invitation is
                            intrusted.</p>
                        <p>I have also written to Mr. Adams that he will consider my request of
                            delay on his part as now withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the confidential conference that we had
                            in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Santiago, on the 16th of the
                            present month, you made known to me the text of the official
                            communication which Mr. Kilpatrick, the minister plenipotentiary of the
                            United States in Chili, addressed to his government under date of August
                            15, last year. The moment I heard it read I observed to you that it
                            contained serious errors and grave inaccuracies, asking you for a copy
                            of it. You had the kindness to send it to me on the 17th day of the
                            present month of January, with a confidential letter in which you copy
                            for me a part of another official communication addressed by Mr.
                            Kilpatrick to his government on the 2d of December, last year.</p>
                        <p>In the confidential conference that we had on the 19th of this month, in
                            the same Department of Foreign Affairs in Santiago, I pointed out to you
                            the errors of fact and inaccuracies of appreciation which the said
                            dispatches of Mr. Kilpatrick to his government of the 15th of August and
                            the 2d of December contained.</p>
                        <p>I think proper, considering the delicate diplomatic situation of the two
                            governments, to put into writing the verbal declarations made to you by
                            the undersigned in the two conferences referred to.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the communication of the 15th of August, I told you that
                            the present President of the Republic, Mr. Santa Maria, and Mr. Joseph
                            Francis Vergara, the minister of war and navy, on the 15th of August,
                            1881, and now minister of the interior, had never spoken to Mr.
                            Kilpatrick about the war on the Pacific, nor about the instructions of
                            Mr. Blaine, nor about the conditions of peace, nor had ever made, as it
                            is natural to understand, a promise of any kind to Mr. Kilpatrick; that
                            my honorable predecessor, Mr. Valderrama, and Messieurs George Huneeus
                            and Luis Aldunate, having met together in the house of Mr. Kilpatrick,
                            to whom he wished to make known his instructions, Mr. Huneeus confined
                            himself to reading and translating them, without either Mr. Valderrama
                            or Mr. Huneeus or Mr. Aldunate giving or pronouncing any opinion about
                            them; that Mr. Kilpatrick, having spoken to Mr. Aldunate, before he was
                            secretary of the treasury, about the advantage of Chili, bearing in mind
                            the wishes of his government with regard to the not annexing of Tarapaca
                            by means of a legislative act only, but rather by the natural consent of
                            a definite treaty of peace, Mr. Aldunate stated to him that it was an
                            idea worthy of being taken into consideration, which reply Mr. Aldunate
                            personally informed me of about the time the said conversation took
                            place; and finally that the ideas that constitute the basis of the
                            purposes disclosed in the instructions of Mr. Blaine had not been
                            accepted, as is alleged, by any of the persons referred to in the
                            dispatch of August 15, 1881.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the note of the 2d of December, 1881, I told you that Mr.
                            Kilpatrick <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0144"/>had spoken to me three
                            times before my taking charge of the office of secretary of foreign
                            affairs about the instructions of Mr. Blaine, and that on the three
                            occasions I answered Mr. Kilpatrick that I had formed no opinion about
                            them, leaving it to the government of Mr. Pinto, or that of Mr. Santa
                            Maria, about to be inaugurated, to pronounce an opinion about any matter
                            of exclusive jurisdiction of public power; that after the 18th day of
                            September, 1881, the day on which I was named secretary of foreign
                            affairs, although I saw Mr. Kilpatrick several times, then very sick and
                            almost always in his bed, I did not speak with him about the
                            instructions, or the wishes of his government, but in reference to the
                            note of October 8, 1881, which I was obliged to address to him in
                            consequence of the publication of the memorandum of Mr. Hurlbut to Mr.
                            Lynch. In that communication the government of Santa Maria defined its
                            future policy in the war, and the necessary conclusions of peace; and on
                            my part there was neither then nor afterwards not even an insinuation
                            that would authorize Mr. Kilpatrick to give to his government the
                            assurances that he gave in the name of Chili in his dispatch of the 2d
                            of December, 1881.</p>
                        <p>I added that Mr. Kilpatrick wrote to his government under the constant
                            influence of a specially grave infirmity, and that he composed his
                            dispatches falling into very serious and without doubt involuntary
                            errors. No reason is seen, nor can any be imagined, that would induce
                            him to act in an opposite manner to that which he always displayed for
                            the maintenance of friendship and cordiality between the Governments of
                            Chill and the United States; but I would fear to compromise that same
                            good and cordial understanding if I did not put into writing the
                            declarations substantially as I made them to you in the conferences of
                            the 16th and 19th of the present month of January.</p>
                        <p>The note of the 22d of November, 1881, of Mr. Blaine to General
                            Kilpatrick, made public, and in which is copied a part of the dispatch
                            of Mr. Kilpatrick to Mr. Blaine, on the date referred to, of the 15th of
                            August, 1881, especially obliges me to proceed in this manner.</p>

                            General Kilpatrick were communicated to you.</p>
                        <p>When I called your attention to these dispatches I of course recognized
                            your right to correct any misconception of the purpose or language of
                            the government into which General Kilpatrick may have fallen, and I have
                            now to express my satisfaction at the courteous manner in which you have
                            pointed out what you consider to be such misconception.</p>
                        <p>Your frank recognition at the conference that the action of the United
                            States Government was properly based upon the confidence which it
                            naturally reposed in its diplomatic representative in Chili, and,
                            resting upon this information, was guided by due consideration of the
                            rights, interests, and supposed wishes of Chili, relieved this incident
                            of any unpleasant influence upon our discussions, and will, I hope,
                            render any further reference to it unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>But you will readily understand that in receiving and transmitting to my
                            government this communication, it is my duty to guard against any
                            admission that General Kilpatrick was alone or altogether in error.</p>
                        <p>After many years of varied, brilliant, and honorable service he died in
                            the discharge of his duty. How far the long and severe illness, to which
                            you refer with such kindly and honorable sympathy, incapacitated him for
                            the grave responsibility with which he was charged, I am unable to
                            judge, especially when you call to my attention that between the dates
                            of the dispatches of August 17 and December 2 there passed between you
                            and himself the communications of October 8, in which were manifested
                            the most cordial and complete understanding between you.</p>
                        <p>That there has been a very serious misunderstanding upon a very important
                            subject between gentlemen alike honorable and responsible, there can be
                            no doubt.</p>
                        <p>But owing to the death of General Kilpatrick it only remains for me to
                            accept with entire good faith the statements you have made, and to
                            express the conviction that if General Kilpatrick were alive to compare
                            his recollections with yourself, and the distinguished gentlemen whom
                            you represent, the apparent misunderstanding would be explained to the
                            satisfaction of all the parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>With sentiments of the highest consideration, &amp;c.,</p>

                        telegram, received by the latter February 6, that the United States only
                        proposed to give counsel and aid to Chili in any negotiations which that
                        country might desire to make; that Chili must herself determine whether or
                        not she would accept such aid, but that in no event would the United States
                        take part in negotiations based upon the surrender of Tarapacá, and a
                        further indemnity of twenty millions, as such a demand is considered
                        exorbitant. The opportunity had arrived for Chili to show herself just and
                        magnanimous.</p>

                    <p>On the 21st of February, 1882, Mr. Frelinghuysen instructed Mr. Trescot, by
                        telegram received the same day, that the President had been hoping to hear
                        further from Mr. Trescot; that the United States would assent to a liberal
                        war indemnity, but that consent was not to be given to the cession of
                        Tarapacá without first communicating with the Department; that should Chili
                        persist in her demand for such cession, the creditors of Peru might possibly
                        maintain that the revenue of Tarapacá had been already hypothecated, and
                        that the President desired to urge moderation on the part of Chili.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your No. 1 of the 13th ultimo,
                        announcing your arrival at Santiago, and the opening negotiations with the
                        Chilian Government. Before answering this dispatch it will be convenient to
                        repeat the substance of the telegrams between you and the Department since
                        the 1st of January, to make sure that they have been properly received.</p>
                    <p>On the 3d of January I telegraphed you to exert a pacific influence, avoiding
                        any issue which might lead to your withdrawal from Chili.</p>
                    <p>On the 4th of January I telegraphed you, to the care of the American consul
                        at Panama, to be forwarded thence by the mail leaving that day, <pb n="74"
                            xml:id="pg_74" facs="0146"/>that the President desired to extend his
                        friendly offices, impartially and alike, to both countries, and I again
                        directed you to exert a pacific influence, and to avoid issues leading to
                        offense.</p>
                    <p>Being myself in negotiation with Mr. Martinez, I informed you that the
                        Calderon affair and its surroundings would be attended to here, and I told
                        you that we preferred that when you came home you should not return by way
                        of Buenos Ayres.</p>
                    <p>It was nearly three weeks before we heard from you, during which time I
                        assume that you were occupied in carrying out your instructions as modified
                        by my telegrams.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of the 23d of January I received a cable from you, the main
                        part of which was easily decipherable; some parts, however, were more
                        difficult. As rendered, it informed the Department that all intention of
                        offending by the removal of Calderon was disclaimed; that our good offices
                        were accepted, and would facilitate conferences with the Peruvian
                        Government, with the exception of Calderon; and that Chili was prepared to
                        make peace on the condition of the cession of Tarapaca, and payment of
                        $20,000,000 within ten years, Arica to be occupied until payment, and to be
                        ceded to Chili in case of default in payment, the guano at Lobos to be
                        appropriated by Chili. In case Peru should refuse peace on these conditions
                        the United States were not to interfere further. You further stated in this
                        telegram that your instructions did not authorize you to offer the good
                        offices of the United States on these conditions, and suggested that I
                        should instruct you not to interfere on these conditions; that you might
                        recognize the necessity of ceding Tarapaca, but if these modifications could
                        not be obtained, I should instruct you to carry out your instruction No.
                        2.</p>
                    <p>As I have before remarked, it took some time to decipher this dispatch. On
                        the 26th of January I received from you another cable informing me that the
                        Chilian minister for foreign affairs was of opinion that General
                        Kilpatrick’s dispatches and instructions should not be published. Before the
                        receipt of that cable both houses of Congress had called for all the
                        correspondence relating to Chili and Peru, and all had been prepared and
                        sent in in response to the call.</p>
                    <p>On the 2d of February you cabled me that it was desirable that I should reply
                        to your telegram of the 23d, and I did so on the 4th of February. I said
                        that this government proposed only to give counsel and to aid in
                        negotiations, and that Chili must determine for herself whether it was wise
                        to listen to such counsel. I reiterated the substance of the former
                        instructions of the President that the United States would not take part in
                        negotiations which are based upon both the surrender of Tarapaca and the
                        payment of $20,000,000. I told you that the demand was looked upon as
                        exorbitant, and that it was thought that the time had come when Chili might
                        be magnanimous and just. Again, on the 21st instant, I telegraphed you that
                        the President and the Department had been hoping that you would report
                        progress by cable. I instructed you that a liberal war indemnity which was
                        not unjust would be assented to by this government, but that the cession of
                        Tarapaca could not be assented to unless you should first cable here for
                        further instructions, and I told you that if Chili should insist upon that
                        cession it was not impossible that the creditors of Peru would maintain that
                        its revenue was hypothecated to them. I further instructed you that the
                        President urges moderation on the part of Chili. Since then I have received
                        nothing from you until your No. 1 arrived a few days since.</p>
                    <p>My telegrams, if they have reached you in an unmutilated form, will have
                        possessed you of the substance of the President’s wishes in this <pb n="75"
                            xml:id="pg_75" facs="0147"/>matter. He is very desirous of having the
                        good offices of the United States made available for the restoration of
                        peace; but he is not willing to become the medium for a proposal, which, in
                        his judgment, is so onerous that it cannot be entertained by Peru. He is
                        still of the opinion that it would be the part of far-sighted wisdom in
                        Chili to accept from Peru the payment of a just indemnity in money,
                        guaranteed, if insisted on, by temporary occupation of territory rather than
                        peremptorily to demand cession of territory.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, he remains convinced that the United States has no right
                        which is conferred either by treaty stipulations or by public law to impose
                        upon the belligerents, unasked, its views of a just settlement, and it has
                        no interests at stake commensurate with the evils that might follow an
                        Interference, which would authorize it to interpose between these parties,
                        farther than warranted by treaties, by public law, or by the voluntary acts
                        of both parties.</p>
                    <p>If Chili is indisposed to listen to friendly advice on this point, the
                        President, as my cable has already informed you, will not take part in
                        negotiations which are based upon both the surrender of Tarapaca and the
                        payment of a large indemnity.</p>
                    <p>To demand of Peru the surrender of the valuable province and the payment of
                        $20,000,000 in ten years, with a disorganized government, provinces in
                        anarchy, and a despoiled territory, is to ask for that which Peru in all
                        probability cannot render.</p>
                    <p>The President cannot permit this government to be a party to such a demand.
                        If there is to be no modification in those terms, it will be the part of
                        wisdom in Chili to carefully consider to what the refusal may lead. The
                        President feels that you may, without impropriety, frankly, but in a
                        friendly spirit, bring some of these considerations before the minister of
                        foreign affairs in your conversations with him.</p>
                    <p>At present, it is understood that the whole of Peru, west of the main chain
                        of the Andes, is in the occupation of Chili, and that the care and expense
                        of maintaining government, of preserving society, and of enforcing order, is
                        thrown upon the armed hostile occupiers. The representatives of Chili are at
                        pains to show us that not only has all pretense of a military opposition
                        disappeared, but that all governmental organization is dissolved, and that
                        the Chilian bayonet is all that saves Peru from anarchy.</p>
                    <p>Admitting this to be so, one of four things must follow: <list>
                            <item>First. That the armed occupation is to be permanent; or</item>
                            <item>Second. That the invader is to be driven out by force; or</item>
                            <item>Third. That Chili will withdraw, retaining so much of Peru as it
                                desires and leaving the rest to its fate; or</item>
                            <item>Fourth. That an honorable peace will be made, leaving to Peru a
                                government and a name.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Chili can hardly desire the first of these alternatives, with the questions
                        that are sure to follow between it and the creditors of Peru.</p>
                    <p>To the second, it will undoubtedly answer that it can never take place; but
                        it will be well to recall events that have taken place in the history of
                        these two powers which tend to show that even the apparently impossible does
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>The third alternative seems to be impracticable. If it were practicable,
                        Chili could not justify herself before the world; and in any event should it
                        eventuate in the occupation and absorption, without the assent of Peru, of
                        territory whose productions are pledged to creditors of that power, this
                        could not be done without raising grave questions in the <pb n="76"
                            xml:id="pg_76" facs="0148"/>future of Chili which the United States, as
                        a friend of that energetic ánd industrious people, would wish to avoid.</p>
                    <p>The fourth alternative is, in the opinion of the President, the wisest and
                        safest course. He is anxious, for many palpable reasons, that it should be
                        brought about through the peaceful influences which the Constitution
                        intrusts to the Executive.</p>
                    <p>The traditional attitude of the United States toward the sister republics of
                        this continent is one of peace and friendly counsel.</p>
                    <p>When as colonies they threw off their political connection with Europe, we
                        encouraged them by our sympathies. By the moral weight of our official
                        declarations we prevented intervention either to restore old political
                        connections with Europe, or to create new ones. The policy we then adopted
                        has been since maintained. While we would draw them nearer to us by bonds of
                        mutual interest and friendly feeling, our sole political connection springs
                        from the desire that they should be prosperous and happy under the
                        republican form of government which they and we have chosen. We aim to be
                        regarded as a disinterested friend and counselor, bat we do not assume to
                        impose our wishes upon them, or to act as arbitrator or umpire in their
                        disputes, unless moved to it by the wish of both parties, or by controlling
                        interests of our own.</p>
                    <p>Restraining our action within this sphere, the President desires you to
                        continue to urge upon Chili, both by the arguments suggested in this
                        instruction and by such other pertinent arguments not inconsistent therewith
                        as may occur to you from your knowledge of the subject, the wisdom and
                        justice of making peace without the acquisition of Tarapaca, unless the
                        province should eventually become Chilian through the inability of Peru to
                        pay a reasonable war indemnity to be agreed on.</p>
                    <p>The President does not presume to indicate what that indemnity should be; but
                        he leaves a discretion with you to absent to the tender of the good offices
                        of the United States to Peru on the basis of a very liberal indemnity to
                        Chili, if Peruvian territory is spared. If Chili insists on retaining any of
                        the territory whose products are or may be claimed by creditors of Peru as
                        mortgaged or hypothecated, or in any other way made the basis of a loan, the
                        President is not willing to involve the United States in the complications
                        which might ensue. He prefers to reserve to this government the full right
                        to determine what its action shall be, should such complications hereafter
                        arise.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch numbered seven, dated
                        February 3, 1882, with regard to the presentation of the invitation to the
                        President of the Republic of Chili to send two delegates to a congress of
                        the American powers, to be held in Washington, in the month of November
                        next, I have the honor to inform you that on the 22d instant I waited upon
                        Señor Balmaceda, Chilian secretary of foreign affairs, and read the
                        invitation to him, stating to him at the same time what arrangements the
                        Government of the United States proposed to make <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77"
                            facs="0149"/>to facilitate the labors of the congress, a statement which
                        I afterward embodied in a memorandum note addressed to him, a copy of which
                        is herewith inclosed.</p>
                    <p>So many erroneous statements as to the object of the proposed congress,
                        translations among others of articles published in the United States, were
                        being constantly circulated in Chili, that it appeared to me that possibly
                        unfortunate impressions as to the purpose and attitude of our government
                        might be created. I was also well assured that the invitation had been
                        presented to every government in South America except Chili. I telegraphed
                        on the 13th instant, to Mr. Osborn, our minister resident near the Argentine
                        Republic, inquiring as to whether he had received the invitation referred
                        to, and, if so, what disposition he had made of it, and he replied that he
                        had received the invitation and at once presented it to the government to
                        which he is accredited. I awaited the receipt of the mail of the 21st
                        instant, and, receiving no instructions upon the subject, thought it best,
                        under the circumstances, to present the invitation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balmaceda informed me that he would be pleased to consider the invitation
                        as having been presented at the earlier date, when I made the attempt to do
                        so, but at his request desisted; that the laudable purpose for which the
                        congress was invited could not but meet the approval of all nations, and
                        that he would transmit the reply of his government at as early date as
                        should be practicable.</p>
                    <p>Trusting that my action will meet your approval,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose herewith translation of the cipher
                        dispatch received by telegraph on February 22, and the answer in cipher
                        which I sent today.</p>
                    <p>1 would have cabled earlier, but that I have been endeavoring from the date
                        of your cipher instruction of February 4 to obtain some modification of the
                        terms which I sent you in telegram of January 23, as those which Chili would
                        accept as the basis of an offer of good offices from the United States.</p>
                    <p>You may assure the President that I have urged upon the Government of Chili
                        the wisdom of moderation in the terms which it demanded. But Chili is
                        determined to have Arica and Tacna, as well as the territory south of the
                        Quebrada of Camarones (Tarapacá). The indemnity of twenty millions, with
                        this region of country as a pledge, was only an indirect mode of securing
                        the country itself.</p>
                    <p>Peru has not, that I can see, any capacity of resistance in herself, and
                        Chili will not yield to any merely friendly persuasion.</p>
                    <p>I ought to inform you that when, upon the receipt of your telegram of the 22d
                        instant, I asked the secretary for foreign affairs for a positive answer
                        whether his government would modify the terms of peace, he said that the
                        government was very much embarrassed by the publication of my cipher
                        dispatch to you of 23d January, of which he had learned by telegram. He said
                        he considered (as I must admit he had a right to consider) that this was a
                        confidential communication to the Government of the United States of the
                        terms which Chili proposed to offer, and that however he might feel disposed
                        to listen to the suggestion of modification, the publication committed his
                        government to their proposals; that they could not now be changed without
                        admitting that they were originally exorbitant, and had been modified under
                        pressure from the United States.</p>
                    <p>Of the sincerity or force of the argument I shall say nothing now, as it will
                        be my duty to furnish you with the history of this negotiation. But

                        accurate knowledge of the wishes and intentions of my government than I have
                        received.</p>
                    <p>The communication to the Government of Chili of the resolution of the
                        Government of the United States that it will not take part in any
                        negotiation based upon the conditions proposed, and the reply of the
                        Government of Chili that it is not prepared to modify these conditions,
                        practically closes this mission. The formal reply to my communication I will
                        receive to-morrow, but I shall not answer it until I have received an answer
                        to my telegram of to-day. I do not feel at liberty, under recent
                        instructions from the Department, to carry out instruction No. 2, <pb n="79"
                            xml:id="pg_79" facs="0151"/>and prefer that the President should
                        instruct me what language I shall use under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>I trust that these instructions will also convey my recall and direct me
                        whether on my way home I shall stop at La Paz and Lima, in order to
                        communicate to the Governments of Bolivia and Peru that the Government of
                        the United States has been forced to withdraw its good offices. Under the
                        instructions with which I was originally furnished, I would feel it to be my
                        duty to do so.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In dispatch No. 8, I informed you that the
                        secretary for forign affairs of Chili desired that the conclusions reached
                        in our own confidential <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0152"/>conferences
                        should be summarized in a protocol. I therefore prepared for his
                        consideration a draft of the three conferences. For this he then proposed to
                        substitute a draft of his own. Upon comparison I found that while there was
                        a general substantial agreement there was wanting in both a sufficiently
                        full statement of the points of discussion, each of us having naturally
                        dwelt more particularly on the views which he had himself expressed. I
                        therefore wrote to Mr. Balmaceda a letter, inclosing draft of protocol
                        confined simply to the points agreed upon. After mutual correction we
                        adopted the protocol which you will find in Inclosure No. 1.</p>
                    <p>I suggested to Mr. Balmaceda that any protocol was premature, as its whole
                        value depended upon the acceptance of the conditions of peace which had been
                        referred to the Government of the United States for consideration.</p>
                    <p>But he thought that it would restore the confidence of the people and
                        Government of Chili in their old and amicable relations with the United
                        States if it could be understood that the incident of the arrest of Senor
                        Garcia Calderon had been satisfactorily explained; that the special mission
                        was an act purely of friendly intervention, and that Chili was willing to
                        accept the good offices of the United States, if the United States could
                        find, in the terms offered by Chili, the basis of such a settlement as they
                        could recommend to the adoption of Peru. When the terms of the protocol were
                        finally settled I found to my surprise that Mr. Balmaceda desired it should
                        be sealed as well as signed. I called to his attention that this instrument
                        was not an act, but a record. It was simply an agreement that the good
                        offices of the United States would be accepted by Chili, if offered upon
                        certain conditions which I had no authority to accept, and which I only
                        undertook to refer to my government for consideration and instruction.</p>
                    <p>He said that it was always the custom in the Chilian foreign office to seal
                        as well as sign protocols, and as the protocol itself provided for the
                        reference to and decision by the Government of the United States, and had
                        absolutely no vitality independent of the consent of the Government of the
                        United States, I agreed to execute it as he desired.</p>
                    <p>In the conversations which preceded the protocol 1 had read to Mr. Balmaceda
                        the dispatches from Mr. Christiancy, Mr. Osborn, and General Kilpatrick, in
                        which they had informed the Government of the United States that the
                        Government of Chili had resolved to support the Calderon government in Peru,
                        and in which General Kilpatrick had even gone further and assured the
                        Government of the United States that the Government of Chili was willing to
                        negotiate with Calderon on the basis of a war indemnity without demanding a
                        cession of territory, except in the case Peru was unable to furnish a
                        reasonable indemnity. While, as you have been informed by earlier
                        dispatches, Mr. Balmaceda was of opinion that General Kilpatrick had fallen
                        into very grave errors in his estimate and statement of the views and
                        intentions of the Chilian Government, he frankly recognized that, acting
                        upon those dispatches from diplomatic representatives entitled to its
                        confidence, the Government of the United States had in its relations to the
                        Calderon government acted in the interest of peace, and with impartial
                        regard to the rights of both belligerents. He was frank, earnest, and
                        explicit in his disavowal of any intended offense to the United States, and
                        claimed that Chili was only acting in the legitimate exercise of her
                        belligerent rights. That Chili had tolerated rather than recognized the
                        Calderon government, but that it had never rested on any substantial basis,
                        and that its issue of paper money, the constant desertion of its soldiers to
                            <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0153"/>the Peruvian troops still in the
                        field, its maintenance of resistance to the Chilian Government, and its
                        communication with the armed forces scattered over Peru from Lima, which was
                        in the military occupation of Chili, rendered its continuance inconsistent
                        with the existing authority or the military purpose of Chili.</p>
                    <p>I told Mr. Balmaceda that if the Calderon government was recognized by Chili
                        as sufficiently strong, constitutional, and representative to make a treaty
                        of peace and cede Peruvian territory to Chili, it was a government
                        sufficiently strong, constitutional, and representative to be recognized by
                        neutrals, and that a reasonable deference to the friendly relations of the
                        United States would seem to have required notice of the intended action of
                        Chili, but I could accept the disavowal as sufficient to withdraw the
                        subject from further discussion and would transmit the explanation to the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>But assuming that this explanation would be satisfactory as to the special
                        action of Chili in forbidding the exercise of any authority of the Calderon
                        government within the lines of Chilian military occupation, and even in the
                        arrest of Señor Garcia Calderon, who was commander-in-chief of the Peruvian
                        forces, he could scarcely expect the Government of the United States to
                        recognize as a belligerent right the abolition of all government in Peru by
                        military order and a consequent anarchy which would render any peace
                        impossible; that the neutral powers had rights, interests, and old
                        established relations with Peru, and so long as they respected the
                        belligerent rights of Chili they were only exercising their own equally
                        clear right in recognizing a government with which they could communicate,
                        and if the United States found itself able to offer its good offices, the
                        acceptance of the offer must imply the recognition of a government with
                        which to deal in Peru as well as in Chili.</p>
                    <p>When we came to reduce this conclusion to an article in the protocol I found
                        that Mr. Balmaceda was not willing to express himself with the same fullness
                        as in our conversation. I was desirous that the form of words used should
                        represent distinctly the ideas expressed above. I would have insisted on
                        this form but that— <list>

                            <item>I was instructed by your telegram received at Valparaiso, January
                                the 4th, 1882, not to make an issue which should terminate the
                                negotiation.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>I was instructed by your telegram of the 10th to Panama and thence
                                by mail, which, however, only reached me on the 31st, that “the
                                Calderon affair and its surroundings can be attended to here when
                                you come home.”</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>When I pressed upon Mr. Balmaceda my preference of the form I had
                                presented, he replied to me by showing me the correspondence between
                                yourself and Mr. Martinez, in which, under date of the 7th January,
                                you expressed the satisfaction of the Government of the United
                                States with the explanation he had made you on behalf of the Chilian
                                Government. He said he considered that question as settled, and I
                                did not feel authorized to press the matter further. I regret that I
                                had not been informed of this correspondence, for if I had been I
                                should not have considered it proper to reopen the discussion of a
                                subject which had been settled by my superiors at home.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>You will observe, however, that in the protocol Mr. Balmaceda confines the
                        exercise of belligerent rights to prohibiting the authority of the Calderon
                        government within the lines of Chilian occupation, and declares that Señor
                        Garcia Calderon is a “prisoner of war,” while he at the same time expresses
                        the readiness of the Chilian Government to <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82"
                            facs="0154"/>facilitate the communication of the diplomatic
                        representative of the United States with any Peruvian authority whom he may
                        recognize as authorized to negotiate with him.</p>
                    <p>The rest of the protocol needs no comment. My instructions had no reference
                        to forcible intervention, and the avowed purpose of my mission was if
                        possible to bring the belligerents to a friendly understanding, and there
                        could therefore be no possible objection to saying so.</p>
                    <p>I was also expressly instructed not to offer the mediation of the United
                        States unless it was solicited, and mediation of necessity implied the
                        consent of both belligerents.</p>
                    <p>The terms of peace being such as Chili was willing to offer, it was her right
                        to state them in such language and to such extent as she deemed proper.</p>
                    <p>And you will observe that the withdrawal of the United States from any
                        further intervention is conditioned upon her approval of the terms and her
                        willingness to recommend them to Peru. In case, as has happened, that the
                        Government of the United States does not approve the terms, and declines to
                        offer good offices upon such conditions, entire liberty of action is
                        reserved.</p>
                    <p>When the protocol had been signed, I communicated to Mr. Balmaceda the
                        decision of the United States, which you had made known to me in the
                        telegram of the 4th of February. When I made this communication Mr.
                        Balmaceda desired that I would so modify the language as not to qualify the
                        terms offered. I was willing to substitute a milder phrase for the word
                        “exorbitant.”</p>
                    <p>But this did not satisfy him. He said he thought that the offer of good
                        offices having been accepted in a friendly spirit, and in special deference
                        to the United States, we ought not, in withdrawing it, to censure the terms
                        in such emphatic language.</p>
                    <p>The withdrawal itself was sufficient. You will remember that the language
                        used was: “The Government of the United States can take no part in any
                        negotiation based both upon the cession of Tarapacá and a further indemnity
                        of twenty millions.”</p>
                    <p>In the mean time I received your telegram of the 22d, in which you clearly
                        limited the language of the telegram of the 4th.</p>
                    <p>From the first it might have reasonably been inferred that you would offer
                        your good offices in the alternative, either upon the cession of Tarapacá or
                        upon a liberal war indemnity, but not upon both combined. Your last telegram
                        only authorized me to accept a liberal war indemnity as the basis of good
                        offices.</p>
                    <p>I avail myself, therefore, of Mr. Balmaceda’s objection to withdraw the
                        letter and substitute that which follows the protocol, and which simply says
                        that the United States cannot offer its good offices on these terms.</p>
                    <p>This letter, although dated the 14th, the same date as the original, was not
                        really agreed upon until after the receipt of your telegram of the 22d.
                        (Inclosure No. 2.)</p>
                    <p>On the 24th Mr. Balmaceda replied that the Government of Chili was not
                        prepared to make any modification in its terms. (Inclosure No. 3.)</p>
                    <p>This fact I immediately telegraphed you. This subject is therefore now before
                        you upon the decision of the Government of Chili that it will not modify the
                        terms of peace.</p>
                    <p>I deemed it proper, while informing Mr. Balmaceda confidentially of your
                        estimate of the terms of peace, not to commit the government by any formal
                        qualification, but to leave you entirely free, upon learning <pb n="83"
                            xml:id="pg_83" facs="0155"/>the refusal of the Chilian Government to
                        modify them, to instruct me what answer to make.</p>
                    <p>I therefore wait to know whether I shall simply accept the refusal and
                        withdraw the good offices, reserving to the government entire liberty of
                        action as to the future conduct of Chili, or whether I shall state the
                        reason of the withdrawal, expressing to the Government of Chili the belief
                        of the United States that such terms are exorbitant, or whether I shall take
                        any other action such as the Government of the United States shall consider
                        called for under the circumstances.</p>

                        <head>Protocol.</head>
                        <p>At several conferences held in the department of foreign relations at
                            Santiago, on the 16th, 19th, and 20th days of January of the present
                            year, 1882, Mr. William Henry Trescot, special envoy extraordinary and
                            minister plenipotentiary of the United States of America, and Mr. José
                            Manuel Balmaceda, minister of foreign relations of the Republic of
                            Chili, discussed in a frank and confidential manner the relations of the
                            United States with Chili and Peru, and of the two last-named nations
                            with one another, exchanging their views in terms reciprocally friendly,
                            and mutually agreed to draw up in this single protocol the conclusions
                            which they reached in the aforesaid conference.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First. Mr. Trescot having stated that the United States recognized
                                the government of Garcia Calderon on account of friendship towards
                                the contestants and in the interest of peace, and that the
                                government of his country, being the only one which has recognized
                                the aforesaid government by accrediting a representative near to it,
                                might suppose that the arrest of Garcia Calderon was an act of
                                offense to the United States; and Mr. Balmaceda having said that
                                Chili abolished the authority of Garcia Calderon within the radius
                                occupied by her forces, and arrested him with no purpose of offense
                                to the United States or any other neutral power, and making use of
                                her legitimate belligerent rights, there was no necessity for
                                further discussion of this incident.</item>
                            <item>Second. The armed intervention of the United States in the war
                                which Chili is carrying on with Peru would not be a diplomatic
                                proceeding of the nature of that which is to-day exercised by Mr.
                                Trescot, nor in consequence would it correspond to the friendly
                                spirit of his mission; and mediation does not conform to the
                                convenience of the belligerents, nor is it solicited by Chili. The
                                United States eliminates from all discussion the possibility of
                                armed intervention, and would offer mediation only in case that the
                                belligerents showed a desire to obtain it, and when its acceptance
                                would lead to results satisfactory to both belligerents.</item>
                            <item>Third. The incident of the arrest of Garcia Calderon, the armed
                                intervention and the mediation of the United States, being points
                                eliminated from all discussion and definitely concluded, Chili
                                declares that, as a mark of mutual friendship and confidence, she
                                would accept, if they should be offered, the good offices of the
                                United States in the contest with Peru, provided that the United
                                States, in the exercise of its good offices, accepts the conditions
                                of peace which Chili would be disposed to concede to the enemy; and
                                with the understanding that, if the United States should not obtain
                                the consent of Peru to the conditions of peace, which serve as the
                                basis of its good offices, in that case the action of the United
                                States between the two belligerents should terminate.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. If the good offices of the United States shall be offered
                                and accepted in the manner heretofore set forth, Chili would give,
                                through her civil and military authorities, every possible facility
                                to Mr. Trescot for communicating with any Peruvian authority or
                                persons to whom he may judge fit to offer his good offices, with the
                                exception of Garcia Calderon, who is a prisoner of war.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. The bases in conformity to which Chili will make peace,
                                reserving to herself every right and entire liberty of action, if
                                they should not be accepted by Peru, are as follows: <list>
                                    <label>1st.</label>
                                    <item>Cession to Chili of all the territory of Peru situtated to

                                    <item>Occupation of the region of Tacna and Arica for ten years,

                                        expiration of that time. If at the expiration of that time
                                        Peru should not pay to Chili the twenty millions of pesos,
                                        the territory of Tacna and Arica should remain, <hi

                                        in the territories of the Republic of Chili. Peru may fix in
                                        the treaty of peace a time longer <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84"

                                        conditions just before stated. If Arica returns to the power
                                        of Peru, it shall remain forever unfortified.</item>
                                    <label>3d.</label>
                                    <item>Chili shall occupy the islands of Lobos, so long as there

                                        guano taken from them and that from the mines discovered and
                                        being worked in Tarapaca shall be equally divided between
                                        Chili and the creditors of Peru.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. Trescot deemed it necessary to telegraph to his government,
                            and await a reply, in order to state whether he can offer to Chili the
                            good offices of the United States in the manner and conditions herein

                            Government of the United States the conditions of peace which the
                            Government of Chili was willing to offer to Peru, through the good

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s note dated the 14th of this month, in which
                            you are pleased to communicate to me that, in compliance with the
                            agreement in the conference as testified by the protocol of the 11th
                            instant, you have addressed a communication to your government; that
                            your excellency is instructed and authorized to answer in its name; that
                            you were desirous to offer its impartial co-operation and its friendly
                            aid in the negotiations of peace with Peru; that it cannot tender its
                            good offices upon the conditions proposed, and that you are instructed
                            to inquire whether the government of Chili will modify them, and in what
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>In the protocol of February 11th instant, the basis was laid down in
                            accordance to which my government would accept the good offices if, for
                            the purpose of procuring peace on the conditions proposed, they were
                            expontaneously offered to it. That I am now instructed that the
                            Government of the United States does not offer its good offices, which
                            is an answer to my government, to the question that was left pending in
                            said protocol.</p>
                        <p>And finally I have the honor to say to you, in the name of his excellency
                            the President of the Republic, that we maintain the conditions of peace
                            set forth in the document already cited, because they are demanded by
                            absolute rigorous necessity on account of expenses, and the damages
                            caused by the war, the security of the Republic, and its future
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Chili has ever had confidence in the neutrality and
                            good friendship of the Government of the United States. This friendship
                            and confidence is <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0157"/>strengthened
                            without doubt by the declarations contained in the protocol of February
                            11, and also by those contained in the note which I have the honor to
                            reply to, in which, besides saying that your government will not offer
                            its good offices, you express the desire to tender its impartial
                            co-operation and its friendly aid in the negotiations that may lead the
                            belligerents to the termination of the struggle.</p>
                        <p>With sentiments of the highest consideration, I have the honor to
                            subscribe myself, your excellency’s obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>In the instructions given by Mr. Blaine to the honorable minister of the
                            United States in Chili, Mr. Trescot, mention is made of the notes of
                            August 15 and December 2 of last year, addressed by General Kilpatrick
                            to his government.</p>
                        <p>In the conferences that took place on the 16th, 19th, and 20th of
                            January, the text of those notes was made known, and at the moment Señor
                            Balmaceda objected, immediately addressing an official note to the
                            special envoy of the United States, in which he made serious
                            rectifications.</p>
                        <p>The said notes having been published in the United States, and reference
                            having been made to them in the instructions which Mr. Blaine gave to
                            Mr. Trescot, it is expedient to make known officially, whilst awaiting
                            the arrival of the original documents published in the United States
                            which will authorize the publications of the rectifications by Mr.
                            Balmaceda in Chili, that those notes contain substantial errors.</p>
                        <p>This rectification being of as much interest for the exactness of the
                            foreign transactions of the Government of Chili as for the cordial and
                            correct understanding with the United States, it is proper that it
                            should be made known that the Government of Chili has objected to the
                            notes of August 15th and December 2d of last year from Mr. Kilpatrick to

                            read to me from a copy of a memorandum just received from a personal

                            Admiral Lynch, commanding the Chilian forces in Peru, and at the same
                            time he informed me that he had, in November last, addressed a dispatch
                            to the court of Brazil, indicating the same policy to be pursued as that
                            foreshadowed by Hurlbut’s memorandum, copies of which dispatch were sent
                            to the Argentine representatives at Washington and London, to be laid

                        <p>A dispatch was sent by this department under date of November 9, 1880, to
                            the Argentine minister to Brazil, signifying to him that after the
                            unexpected outcome of the noble mediation offered to the belligerents of
                            the Pacific by the United States Government, it deemed it expedient to
                            renew a friendly mediation to be carried out by such states as should,
                            on account of their geographical position, be able to tender it with as
                            little delay as possible. In accordance with these views the minister
                            was directed to bring the matter to the knowledge of the Brazilian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>An indication was likewise made that, should the suggestion be met by the
                            approval of said government, this one was of opinion that the Cabinet at
                            Washington ought to be made acquainted with this initiatory step in case
                            that Cabinet should be inclined to repeat the tender of good offices so
                            nobly proffered on the former occasion.</p>
                        <p>These instructions were amplified by a dispatch under date of the 10th of
                            the same month, in which the Argentine minister was informed that the
                            President desired that, at the conference the minister was to propose
                            and base on the previous dispatch, he was to prudently enter into
                            considerations on the conduct observed by the allied governments in the
                            Paraguayan war, a war in which said governments did not think that they
                            were, as victors, entitled to exact any cession of territory.</p>
                        <p>He was reminded at the same time that it was advisable that he, in his
                            conversation with the Brazilian foreign secretary, should lay stress on
                            the fact that this government has no further interest beyond the
                            achievement of peace; inasmuch as the upshot of the campaign will in no
                            wise influence the solution of the boundary question.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine minister to Brazil acknowledged the receipt of these
                            dispatches, and in pursuance thereof had an interview with the foreign
                            secretary at which the latter manifested his desire to be made
                            acquainted with the opinion of the Argentine Government as to the <hi
                                rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> and manner of making the mediation
                            an efficient one. He added that he likewise, for his part, accepted the
                            idea of bringing this to the knowledge of the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Some time after, on December 14, this department communicated to the
                            Argentine minister to Brazil that the President would view with
                            satisfaction the acceptation by the Brazilian Government of the
                            proposals he had made, and we counseled the suggesting to the foreign
                            secretary the advisability of a spontaneous procedure on our <pb n="87"
                                xml:id="pg_87" facs="0159"/>part, without waiting for any indication
                            from the interested governments. At the same time we authorized said
                            minister to come to an agreement as to the manner of making the
                            mediation an efficient one.</p>
                        <p>The Argentine minister confirmed the statements of his previous dispatch
                            as regards the acceptance of the idea of mediation by the Brizilian
                            Government, adding that he believes that the government has but little
                            faith in the matter, on account of the advanced stage of the war. He
                            also stated that he had had an interview with the foreign secretary,
                            whom he asked if his government was disposed to admit the joint
                            mediation establishing the following principles as appertaining to
                            American international law: to mitigate the horrors of war, and not to
                            exercise the right of conquest?</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian minister objected to make these declarations on the ground
                            that they might prove a difficulty in the way of the mediation.</p>
                        <p>The dispatch winds up by saying that he is satisfied that the imperial
                            government is only disposed to tender an officious mediation on the
                            condition that it be asked for by the interested parties.</p>
                        <p>On December 18, this department forwarded to the Argentine minister to
                            Brazil the bases on which it considered the mediation ought to be
                            offered. They are as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>This government is of opinion that after appointing their extraordinary
                            representatives, these ought to offer the Chilian Government the joint
                            mediation, and that the offer should be also made to the allies, setting
                            forth the friendly motives that give rise to this act of sincere
                            cordiality, and signifying their readiness to favor by every means
                            consonant with their duty, and with the impartial policy of their
                            governments, the possibility of the belligerents being able to bring
                            about by just and equitable settlements the end of the war that is
                            dividing them.</p>
                        <p>If, as is probable, the joint mediation is accepted, the opportunity
                            would have arrived for mediating ministers to enter upon their mission,
                            encouraging a meeting of plenipotentiaries of the belligerents on board
                            of some man-of-war of the imperial navy, or, in defect of this, on some
                            other neutral one.</p>
                        <p>The meeting brought about, the mediating minister might open and preside
                            over the conference, whereat they would solicit proposals for peace, and
                            have them discussed; in this they will use every effort to bring about
                            the result that is so vehemently desired.</p>
                        <p>They will favor by their friendly wishes every proposition that shall be
                            conducive to the end aimed at, the re-establishment of peace. But they
                            are on no account to abet any such as may tend to segregate territory or
                            to lower the rights that any of the three belligerents may have as
                            sovereign owner.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, should any such propositions be advanced (and, as it is
                            natural, rejected) by any of the belligerents, the mediators are bound
                            to use their discreet and friendly efforts toward their being
                            substituted by others that do not imply destruction of sovereign rights
                            nor territorial annexation.</p>
                        <p>Besides this kind of proposals, they are to contribute with all the
                            prudence the question calls for to the acceptance of such as may be
                            submitted as conducive to bringing about peace.</p>
                        <p>The Chilian Government in its circular dispatch to foreign governments
                            solemnly declares that it only aims at guarantees of peace for the
                            future, and indemnification for damages and expenses incurred.</p>
                        <p>After setting forth in these words the pretensions of the Chilian
                            Government, the mediators can base their good offices on that <hi
                                rend="italic">exposé</hi>, and their efforts are to aim at the
                            guaranteeing of peace by suitable associations of circumstances, without
                            at all affecting the sovereign rights and territorial integrity of the
                            belligerents.</p>
                        <p>As regards the payment of indemnifications and the manner of efficiently
                            carrying them out, the mediators will employ all such means as may be
                            suggested to them by their ability, to arrive at an agreement as to said
                            demands which cannot be the cause of a desolating war.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II.</p>
                        <p>Should the belligerent governments, or any of them, refuse to attend by
                            means of plenipotentiaries any further conferences, the mediators will
                            ask for such bases or propositions as might be conducive to a solution,
                            and these they will submit to the other belligerent, and thus continue
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The ministers should follow the same preceding rules; that is to say,
                            they will decline to be the channel for exactions of territorial
                            cessions which would be tantamount to conquest. Should any such
                            propositions be brought forward they are to be forthwith substituted by
                            others calculated to bring about the lasting peace that is aimed at.</p>
                        <p>In the event of some one of the belligerents unfortunately insisting on
                            maintaining said propositions of annexation as essential, and should
                            refuse to substitute them, the mediators will declare that they are not
                            able to submit them and that they prefer bringing their mission to an
                            end.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0160"/>
                        <p rend="center">III.</p>
                        <p>If, as is not probable, the mediation should not be admitted by some of
                            the belligerents, the mediators will signify that their governments
                            believe the duty fulfilled which had been imposed upon them by the
                            reigning spirit of humanity in this century and by that of fraternity
                            which ever characterized the relations between the states of America.
                            That they deeply regret the obstacles they have met with and which they
                            submit to the consideration of their governments and to that of
                            impartial nations, who will judge alike of the difficulties and of the
                            responsibility they carry with them.</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                        <p>Should the belligerents definitely refuse (which would not seem to be
                            possible) to put forward propositions that may be made use of as a basis
                            for discussion, the mediators might for their part tender some such as
                            the following:</p>
                        <p>Joint payment to Chili by Peru and Bolivia of the expenses of the war,
                            the amount of which would be fixed by joint commissions.</p>
                        <p>Restoration of goods and lands taken from private individuals.</p>
                        <p>Indemnification for damages caused.</p>
                        <p>Guarantees for peace and the payment of amounts due.</p>
                        <p>Submission to the arbitration of some impartial power of all preceding
                            questions, and of all such as may arise in connection with such treaties
                            as may be stipulated.</p>
                        <p>On January 17, the Argentine minister communicated to this department
                            that, according to what had been signified to him by the managing
                            director at the foreign office, no answer had up to then been given to
                            his dispatch of December 25, as the minister had intended to tender his
                            resignation, but that, as the circumstances no longer existed, it would
                            be answered as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th of April, the Argentine minister sent a dispatch to the
                            Brazilian department for foreign affairs, and informed it that this
                            government had directed him to renew the proposition to mediate between
                            the belligerents, and that the basis previously indicated is the same
                            that the Argentine Government again submits.</p>
                        <p>Later on, under date of July 17, the Argentine minister gave notice that
                            he had received a communication from the foreign secretary, in which the
                            latter declared that, some short time before his receipt of the note of
                            April 9, the news had come from London that the French, English, and
                            Italian Governments, at the request of that of Peru, were about to use
                            their good offices for the re-establishment of peace.</p>
                        <p>This was borne out by the answer given in the House of Lords to a
                            question put to the government by Sir Charles Dilke, under secretary of
                            state for foreign affairs.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian foreign secretary added that a complication was rising. The
                            mediation proposed by the Argentine Government had to be offered to the
                            three belligerents and would be met by that of the three European powers
                            asked for by one of the allies, as it would seem, without the assent of
                            the other.</p>
                        <p>The imperial government was obliged to await information to throw a light
                            on the procedure of the three powers referred to.</p>
                        <p>It now knows that they have already given instructions to their
                            diplomatic agents in the west coast, and that they would recognize the
                            authority of Garcia Calderon, as soon as ever they became convinced that
                            the Chilian Government was in treaty with him.</p>
                        <p>In view of this state of affairs, the imperial government proposes, in
                            answer to the suggestion of mediation of a joint nature made by the
                            Argentine minister, a tender of good offices without indicating the
                            conditions of peace, and this offer will be made either to Chili and
                            Bolivia alone, if Peru had accepted European intervention, or to all of
                            the three, in case that intervention had not been accepted.</p>
                        <p>On August 28, this department addressed the Argentine minister and
                            manifested that this government was disposed to tend, with that of
                            Brazil, toward the acceptance of the good offices to which the dispatch
                            of the 15th refers.</p>
                        <p>He was authorized to agree to the form to be adopted for the opening
                            steps, and was empowered to accept the indications contained in the
                            dispatch of the 15th.</p>
                        <p>He is recommended to draw, as far as possible, the basis together as
                            submitted for the good offices, previously tendered for the joint
                            mediation, but should this not be possible, he may accept the
                            starting-point proposed by Mr. de Souza.</p>
                        <p>In August (31st), 1881, the Argentine minister informs the department
                            that Mr. Caballero, the Bolivian minister to Brazil, had signified to
                            him that the Bolivian government not only accepts the offer of good
                            offices in its own name, but in that of the dictator of Peru.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I must ask that this dispatch be considered
                        entirely confidential. My reason for the request will, I think, be apparent
                        and satisfactory when you have read it.</p>
                    <p>In dispatch No. 13, under date March 4, I communicated to you the protocol
                        and the consequent correspondence between Señor Balmaceda and myself. The
                        position then established was that the Government of the United States
                        declined to offer its good offices upon the conditions stated in the
                        protocol, and the Government of Chili declined to modify those
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>From the date of that correspondence up to the time of my leaving Valparaiso,
                        I had several full and frank conversations with the Chilian secretary of
                        state.</p>
                    <p>I cannot undertake to repeat these discussions in detail. It will be
                        sufficient to say that on the Sunday before my departure (18th March) the
                        secretary expressed to me in the strictest confidence his willingness to
                        consider the following modifications of his original terms, if Peru would
                        propose them as a substitute:</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>You will see that these are very considerable concessions. Of course I told
                        the secretary that I had no authority to accept them as the basis of an

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 19, April 5,I
                        have to inform you that I left Lima, as telegraphed, on the 15th for Casma,
                        the only open port on the Peruvian coast, and thence proceeded to Huaraz,
                        the seat of the provisional constitutional government of Peru. The journey
                        having been safely accomplished, no reference to its incidents is necessary.
                        But it is perhaps proper that I should call your attention to the fact that
                        it is scarcely proper that the minister from the United States to Peru
                        should reside within the lines of the Chilian military occupation, and if,
                        as he ought, he goes to the seat of the provisional government he must be
                        prepared to meet great discomfort. Huaraz is an old Indian town one hundred
                        miles from the coast, lying between the Black Cordillera and the Cordillera
                        Nevada, which is the line of perpetual ice. The elevation is high enough to
                        occasion great uneasiness to persons unaccustomed to such elevation, and it
                        can only be reached by the mountain road traveled by the pack-mules which
                        bring to the coast the ore from the silver mines of the province.</p>
                    <p>I undertook the journey because I believed that the presentation of my
                        letters of credence would strengthen what is unquestionably the real
                        Government of Peru, recognized and obeyed at present by all parties of the
                        Peruvian people. It is, of course, confined in its sphere of authority, is
                        feeble in strength, and restricted in resources, but it is an actual
                        government, and represents whatever Peruvian nationality still exists. You
                        will remember that while accepting the disavowal of the Chilian Government
                        of any intended offense in the arrest of Señor Calderon, I took the ground
                        that such action could not destroy the existence of the Government of Peru,
                        and I felt bound to do whatever was necessary to maintain the recognition of
                        that government by the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0163"/>
                    <p>I was also authorized, as dispatch No. 19 has informed you, to indicate to
                        the Peruvian Government that certain modifications in the terms of the
                        protocol would be considered by the Chilian Government. The only government
                        in Peru which, under my instructions, I was authorized to recognize was the
                        provisional government; and if there was any possibility of bringing the
                        belligerents to a negotiation for peace, the matter was too important for
                        any but direct communication with the President of Peru himself.</p>
                    <p>I arrived in Huaraz on Saturday, the 22d April, and presented my credentials
                        to General Montero on Tuesday, the 25th. I inclose the very brief speech
                        which I made, and the President’s reply. (Inclosures No. 1 and 2.) After
                        several conferences with Señor Alvarez, the secretary for foreign affairs,
                        he addressed me the letter which you will find in inclosure No. 3.</p>
                    <p>I found General Montero and his advisers fully alive to the importance to
                        Peru of peace, and perfectly aware that under existing circumstances peace
                        could only be obtained at the cost of great sacrifice. But I am obliged to
                        modify to some extent the impression which I had received in Lima, and which
                        I communicated in dispatch No. 19. I am still of opinion that three-fourths,
                        if not more, of the business men on the coast would make peace at the cost
                        of the cession of Tarapaca, and I believe that the government also
                        recognizes the necessity. But the government is not strong enough to act
                        independently, and the papers from the United States containing Senator
                        Call’s speech and your instruction to me of the 24th February have induced a
                        belief here that a practical intervention of the United States to save
                        cession of Tarapaca is still possible.</p>
                    <p>There is not, in my opinion, the slightest possibility of Peru’s contributing
                        anything to such a result. She depends entirely upon the action of the
                        United States. I cannot express too strongly my conviction that the time has
                        come when the United States Government should say distinctly to Peru to what
                        extent it is prepared to act practically in the way of intervention. As I
                        wrote you, the Chilian Government is perfectly aware that if the United
                        States determine to intervene forcibly, the opportunity must be given to
                        Peru to pay a sufficient indemnity and save the cession of territory. But
                        Chili does not believe that the United States will so interfere, and she
                        will maintain her position until the demonstration of such forcible
                        intervention is made. Peru ought not to be allowed to delude hereself with
                        such an expectation if it is not to be realized.</p>
                    <p>As I have said, General Montero recognized the necessity for peace, and while
                        he was not prepared to accept either the terms of the protocol or the
                        modifications indicated in dispatch No. 19, he was prepared to make an
                        earnest and serious effort for peace upon the preliminary conditions— <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>That the Chilian Government should recognize him as the lawful
                                executive representative of the existing provisional government of
                                Peru. This he undoubtedly is. All parties and factions in Peru have
                                agreed to recognize and obey his authority, and I cannot see how the
                                Chilian Government can expect him to make peace until it is willing
                                to recognize his authority to do so; which can only be derived from
                                his official position as the executive of an actual
                                government.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>If so recognized, he is a constitutional ruler, although a
                                provisional one, and can only act within the limits of his
                                constitutional authority. A treaty signed by him without the consent
                                of the National Congress would be simply worthless, and he cannot,
                                as an honest and honorable <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0164"
                                />man, pledge himself in advance to any treaty. General Montero
                                therefore asks that the Chilian Government will grant such an
                                armistice as will enable him to call his Congress together at
                                Arequipa, the only place where it can be conveniently called. I am
                                so sure that you will consider these requests reasonable that I have
                                urged their concession upon the Chilian Government, and you will
                                find in inclosure No. 4 my letter to the Chilian secretary for
                                foreign affairs.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I addressed him this letter because I had this morning a long interview with
                        General Lynch, the military commander, and Señor Novoa, the representative
                        of the civil authority of Chili here. Señor Novoa, who informs me that he is
                        authorized to conduct the negotiation for peace, was not prepared to act
                        upon my representations, and, as he felt bound to refer the question to his
                        government, I addressed the secretary for foreign affairs directly.</p>
                    <p>What the terms of peace should be I will not now attempt to discuss. I
                        suppose my views would not be entirely acceptable to either party. But I do
                        think that the requests of General Montero are reasonable, and that their
                        refusal affords a fair ground for protest on the part of the independent
                        powers who desire to see peace restored.</p>
                    <p>My letter, however, to the Chilian secretary for foreign affairs expresses my
                        views so fully as to render their repetition here unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>If these requests are granted, I think an earnest negotation may be expected,
                        with some assurance of a practical result. In that case I deem it of the
                        utmost importance that I be allowed to come home and lay before you the
                        results of my observation here, which I can scarcely do with sufficient
                        fullness in a dispatch. You will then be enabled, I trust, to give definite
                        instructions to the excellent, experienced, and able ministers who have been
                        recently appointed to supply the vacant missions in Chili and Peru.</p>

                            your excellency my credentials as special envoy extraordinary and
                            minister plenipotentiary from the President of the United States to your
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I need not assure your excellency of the sympathy felt by the United
                            States in the efforts made by the provisional government of Peru to
                            establish order and to obtain peace. The prompt recognition of Señor
                            Calderon, the continued recognition of the government, after it had been
                            deprived of the eminent and patriotic services of that distinguished
                            citizen, and the earnest and persistent efforts made by my government to
                            find a basis upon which its intervention, in a spirit of equal
                            friendship and respect for all the belligerents, could contribute to
                            effect a secure and honorable peace, are proofs sufficient.</p>
                        <p>It would be manifestly unbecoming in me to discuss the causes which have
                            so far obstructed the success of this endeavor. But I have felt it my
                            duty to wait upon your excellency, not without the hope that means may
                            yet be found by which, with mutual and honorable concession,
                            negotiations may be initiated, which will reconcile the interests of all

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I receive with the greatest
                            satisfaction the credentials of the envoy of the great republic, called
                            upon, on account of its progressive ideas and unlimited prosperity, to
                            exercise its beneficial influence in the moral order of the
                            continent.</p>
                        <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>The sympathy of the United States towards the provisional government has
                            not only been demonstrated by the great proofs that you have just shown,
                            but by visible results. Your predecessor, General Hurlbut, whose memory
                            will be preserved in Peru with eternal gratitude on account of his
                            opportune mission near the provisional government of Señor Garcia
                            Calderon, and on account of having strengthened the constitutional
                            government in our country, caused that sympathy to produce unspeakable
                            good at the time.</p>
                        <p>My government highly esteems the recognition of it, and welcomes with the
                            most profound esteem the mission that you have come to fulfill at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The basis upon which the efforts of your government wishes to make peace
                            is easy to be understood in justice and in the interest of the entire
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>It appears that some countries have considered the question of the
                            Pacific as one of simply a private interest between three belligerent
                            republics. The Government of Chili expressed to the neutral powers in
                            its war circular against Peru, that it would not be reasonable to
                            suppose that the government of Santiago would attempt to modify the
                            geographical limits of the neighboring nations. That statement caused
                            the war on the Pacific to be looked upon in that light; but afterwards
                            that government changed, after having solemnly averred it, and therefore
                            the face of the question was completely changed.</p>
                        <p>The pretensions of Chili, palpable before the war, and exposed after its
                            victories, have transformed the apparent question of private interests
                            among three republics into a question of continental interest.</p>
                        <p>To-day the question is whether a State that declares war to settle
                            disputes which are susceptible of a peaceable solution can, as a
                            consequence of its victories and of the sacrifices that it had no
                            necessity to make, exact not only complete success, but the acquisition
                            of territory and riches to which it never pretended to have a right.</p>
                        <p>The question is one of conquest; a continental and American question.</p>
                        <p>In your great nation and the others of this continent, you have to
                            consider if by Chilian preponderance on the Pacific, by means of the
                            appropriation of foreign territories and the boundless wealth they
                            contain, the door would be left open for other encroachments by force of
                            arms and for national changes in consequence of conquest.</p>
                        <p>Peru has to look forward, as likewise all America, to the influence and
                            the results that these transformations would bring about in the
                            relations between the old and the new continent. Finally, Peru has to
                            struggle for the triumph of principle.</p>
                        <p>Every epoch has its moral progress and some prevailing idea for the good
                            of humanity; Chili has not been capable, with the fortune of its arms,
                            of combating in this war for the triumph of a beneficent idea, but only
                            for usurpation. Peru is capable, in the midst of its misfortunes, of
                            sacrificing its present in order to contribute by determined resistance,
                            toward securing the future of America, and will not abandon that course
                            without disappearing as an independent nation.</p>
                        <p>The solidity of interests and the nature of the social and political
                            basis upon which the existence of the American states depend, in their
                            internal order and in their external relations, permit us to hope that
                            the generous exertions of the great republic of this continent, in favor
                            of the re-establishment of peace upon honorable and equitable
                            conditions, have not been concluded, since reasons of justice, political
                            morality, and legitimate influence, which initiated them with such a
                            laudable purpose and which is sanctioned by the history and the
                            traditional policy of your government, still exist.</p>
                        <p>Peru desires peace and is ready to make any concession that will not
                            wound its honor, its rights, and interests, or the rights, honor, and
                            interests of the allies.</p>
                        <p>Your noble mission will contribute, I hope, to avoid the dismemberment,
                            and with it the destruction, of the ancient nationalities of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>The eminent qualities which adorn and make you personally so estimable
                            are a guarantee for the happy success of these ideas.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>:The mission which your excellency has come
                            to fulfill near the Government of Peru is another proof of the repeated
                            efforts of your excellency’s government to bring about peace between the
                            belligerent republics on the Pacific; but up to now these efforts have
                            only met with two impediments, which cannot be considered insuperable to
                            a peaceful mind. The first is found in conditions which Chili proposes
                            to impose— conditions which I need not define with particularity, since
                            the government of your <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0166"/>excellency
                            has viewed them as inacceptable as a starting point in its good offices.
                            The second is the resistance that Chili makes to all previous
                            discussion. The purpose is clearly not to allow a discussion, and this
                            determination, which is not reasonable, nor according to the usual
                            practice of modern nations, shuts the door to every way to an
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Peru wishes peace and is ready to make for that purpose, in concert with
                            its ally, the Republic of Bolivia, any sacrifice that will not
                            compromise the future which both have had the right to expect since they
                            entered the list of independent republics. But it is impossible to know
                            either the nature of these sacrifices or how far they may go without a
                            reasonable debate that would carry conviction to the mind. It is not
                            impossible, on the other hand, that Chili itself may become persuaded of
                            the convenience and necessity of modifying its pretension to some
                            acceptable terms, and it would appear incompatible with the rules of
                            human prudence for Chili itself to place, with unnecessary persistence,
                            obstacles in the path of its own interests.</p>
                        <p>The inconveniences that appear to have been alleged by Chili at one time
                            against entering into conferences with Bolivia and Peru were on account
                            of the internal dissensions of the latter; but your excellency is a
                            witness that they do not exist and that there is only one government
                            recognized without exception from one end of the country to the other;
                            that this government is the emanation of a constitutional congress, and
                            that all factions have yielded to its authority.</p>
                        <p>It would not be possible to explain in truth how a government recognized
                            by the government of your excellency, before which your excellency is
                            discharging your mission, and which is the only one in the country,
                            should not be considered by the Government of Chili as the Government of
                            Peru with which to discuss the points of an arrangement. The Government
                            of Chili can do no less than abandon this idea, because by the force of
                            things it has to come to an understanding with some political entity
                            that may represent Peru, and this cannot be any other than the legal
                            government recognized by all the nation.</p>
                        <p>In such a case, the provisional government being a constitutional
                            government and being bound by a treaty to the constitutional government
                            of Bolivia, it should proceed with its approval in all its resolutions.
                            Therefore the road to peace might be shortened and facilitated if both
                            governments could get together, and Peru arrange the best means of
                            assembling Congress, without whose approval any arrangement is
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency’s mission is one of peace, I deem it proper to make
                            you the present suggestions, that tend to level the first difficulties
                            which come in the way, and thus to show the sincere wish that my
                            government entertains of reaching it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are aware that in my last confidential
                            conversation with your predecessor, Señor Balmaceda, it was understood
                            that if the opportunity offered, I was authorized to indicate to the
                            provisional government of Peru certain possible modifications in the
                            terms of peace stated in the protocol.</p>
                        <p>I have presented my credentials to General Monteroas Vice-President of
                            the provisional constitutional government of Peru and have had several
                            conferences with Señor Alvarez, his secretary of state for foreign
                            affairs.</p>
                        <p>I found General Montero and his advisers fully aware of the importance of
                            peace to Peru and not disposed to conceal from themselves or the country
                            that at the end of an honorable, patriotic, but unsuccessful war, peace
                            would have to be purchased at the cost of great sacrifices. He would
                            have found himself unable to discuss the acceptance of the terms stated
                            in the protocol. But if he was at liberty to assume that these terms
                            were capable of modification, he would gladly, in concert with his ally,
                            the Government of Bolivia, make every effort to reach such modification
                            as would satisfy the just demands of Chili.</p>
                        <p>But you are aware that the President is only the executive officer of a
                            government which is constitutional while it is provisional. A treaty
                            signed by him, without the authority of the National Congress,
                            especially if it should provide for the cession of territory, would be
                            simply worthless.</p>
                        <p>It would seem therefore only reasonable that before the President makes
                            any overtures looking to peace, he should have an assurance from the
                            Chilian Government on two points:</p>
                        <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0167"/>
                        <p>1. That he will he recognized by the Chilian Government as the lawful
                            executive representative of the provisional constitutional government of
                            Peru.</p>
                        <p>I think it cannot be denied that at the present moment the government of
                            General Montero, however reduced his forces or restricted his resources,
                            does represent the existing nationality of Peru, and is recognized and
                            obeyed by the Peruvian people.</p>
                        <p>2. In order to initiate the negotiations which it is hoped may lead to a
                            secure and honorable peace, the President would have to receive the
                            authority of the National Congress to make the necessary concessions. Is
                            the Government of Chili willing to agree to such an armistice as would
                            allow the President to summon Congress to meet him at Arequipa, the only
                            place at which it could be conveniently assembled? If so, the President
                            is prepared immediately to call Congress together to lay before them the
                            condition of the country, the necessity for peace, and the terms upon
                            which it may probably be obtained. I venture to express the earnest hope
                            that you will find an acceptance of these preliminary conditions
                            consistent with the rights and interests of your government.</p>
                        <p>It is needless for me to recall to you the fact that General Montero
                            holds his office by virtue of the authority of Congress, which gave him
                            power to make peace, but which forbade his doing so on the basis of
                            cession of territory. It is therefore impossible for General Montero to
                            make any promises implying territorial cession in advance. Such promises
                            would have no official weight whatsoever; nor do I think that with due
                            regard to his honor you could ask him to make assurances of such a
                            nature. But I am of opinion that as all parties in Peru have recognized
                            him as the constitutional head of the government, and as Chili has never
                            denied the national existence of Peru, he may rightfully ask, when
                            expressing, as he does, a sincere desire for peace, that his path may be
                            thus far facilitated by your government, and recent instructions
                            received from my government warrant me in expressing to you the earnest
                            desire and hope of the United States that Chili may be able to agree to
                            the request made by General Montero.</p>
                        <p>At present it seems to me that the anomalous conditions of the relations
                            between Chili and Peru are the real obstacles to a satisfactory peace.
                            Until Chili recognizes the existence of a lawful and responsible
                            government in Peru, there is no authority with which to deal, and a
                            peace—if such a solution can properly be called a peace— can be reached
                            only by the imposition by force of such terms as Chili may dictate.</p>
                        <p>Nor can I perceive that these concessions would in the slightest degree
                            weaken the present position of the Chilian Government. The terms upon
                            which the armistice would be granted could provide that there should be
                            no change in the military condition, either by increase of the Peruvian
                            forces or the acquisition of supplies, while the full responsibility of
                            accepting or rejecting the terms of peace would be placed where they
                            must finally rest before any peace can be made secure upon the Peruvian
                            people.</p>
                        <p>In making these suggestions you will understand that I am acting upon my
                            last conversation with Señor Balmaceda, rather as a friendly mediator
                            than in my official character as the special envoy to the belligerents.
                            The views of General Montero, as I have expressed them, have been
                            transmitted to my government.</p>
                        <p>I have furnished a copy of this letter to Señor Novoa, and I beg to
                            request that, as it is most important for my government to be informed
                            of the intentions of Chili, you will send an answer to Señor Novoa by
                            cable as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the subject of my dispatch
                            numbered one, and dated Arequipa, March 28, 1882, which is hereunto
                            attached, marked inclosure No. 1,I have the honor to further report that
                            on Wednesday, March 29, 1882, I left Arequipa for La Paz, Bolivia,
                            arriving at the latter place at noon of Friday, March 31. In the
                            afternoon of that day I had the pleasure of receiving visits from Señor
                            Zilveti, Bolivian minister of foreign affairs, and from Señor Del Valle,
                            envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from Peru to Bolivia.
                            These visits were purely of a personal nature, and our conversation was
                            of the most general character.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday morning, April 1,I was, however, received officially by Señor
                            Zilveti, and, in company with the gentleman who accompanied me to La
                            Paz, presented to Señor Salinas, the vice-president of Bolivia, and to
                            the ministers of the government, the President of the country, General
                            Campero, being then with the army (consisting of some five thousand men)
                            at Oruro. The conversation between Señor Zilveti and myself, which
                            followed this presentation, is, with one or two noted exceptions,
                            summarized with sufficient accuracy in the memorandum of Señor Zilveti,
                            which was forwarded to you through Mr. Adams, of which a copy and
                            translation are herewith inclosed (marked inclosures 2 and 3).</p>
                        <p>I had, also, during the evenings of March 31 and April 1, two long
                            interviews with Señor Del Valle, the minister from Peru to Bolivia. Our
                            conversation was unreserved and confidential; the principal incident
                            worthy of comment was that Señor Del Valle showed me a memorandum,
                            signed on the 11th of February last by Señor Zilveti and himself, the
                            effect of which is to strengthen the alliance now subsisting between
                            Peru and Bolivia, and by which the two parties agree to act in entire
                            harmony and concert in all negotiations and efforts for peace with
                            Chili. This agreement was shown to me in such confidence that I beg to
                            earnestly request that knowledge on our part of its existence may be
                            kept secret.</p>
                        <p>Señor Del Valle further stated to me that he feared that his government
                            would not regard with favor the proposition to exchange a portion of its
                            littoral for an interior province of Bolivia, an arrangement which had
                            been suggested by Señor Carrillo, in our conversation at Arequipa. (See
                            my dispatch, inclosure No 1.) The acquisition of such territory would,
                            in his opinion, add nothing to the revenues of Peru; its care and
                            government would be, in fact, only a source of expense, while the port
                            upon the Pacific which Bolivia would obtain by the exchange is a source
                            of large revenue to Peru. It was, however, thought Señor Del Valle,
                            possible for an arrangement to be made by which the effective neutrality
                            of some selected port of Peru—for example, Arica or Mollendo—could be
                            guaranteed to Bolivia, and all the imports and exports of that country
                            admitted and dispatched free of duty. In expressing these opinions Señor
                            Del Valle spoke in a personal capacity, as he had no instructions from
                            his government, nor was he informed as to its views. In the opinions
                            expressed by Señor Carrillo, and reaffirmed by Señor Zilveti, the
                            suggestion is made that Bolivia will cede her littoral to Chili only as
                            in lieu of an indemnity, and that it shall be clearly expressed in the
                            treaty of peace that acquisition of territory as the rightful result of
                            conquest in war is not in any way recognized, but is, on the contrary,
                            expressly disavowed. Señor Del Valle, who was informed of these views of
                            the Government of Bolivia, stated to me that they would doubtless
                            coincide with those of his own government, but he was unable to see how,
                            in accordance with these ideas, Peru could justly surrender Tarapaca.
                            Bolivia yields Atacama only because she finds hereself unable to pay a
                            war indemnity, the amount of which is to be specified in the definitive
                            treaty, and which she admits that, as a vanquished nation, she ought to
                            pay. But how can Peru be called upon to cede territory when she is
                            willing and amply able to pay the most liberal indemnity to Chili? I
                            make mention of these views merely for the purpose of pointing out a
                            stumbling-block, which would seem to obstruct united and harmonious
                            effort on the part of Peru and Bolivia to make peace with Chili.</p>
                        <p>Leaving La Paz on the morning of Sunday, April 2, I arrived in Arequipa
                            on the evening of Monday the 3d. That evening Señor Carillo, the
                            Bolivian minister, called upon me, and again expressed his desire to
                            proceed to Lima, requesting me to obtain from the Chilian authorities
                            the necessary permission to do so. This, as you are aware, I did, upon
                            returning to Lima, and on April 15 forwarded to him the passport which,
                            at my request, Señor Novoa had obtained for him and for his secretary
                            from Admiral Lynch, but so poor are the postal arrangements that, though
                            Señor Carillo did not leave Arequipa until the 4th of May, my letter
                            containing the passport and marked upon the envelope as from the special
                            mission of the United States never reached him.</p>
                        <p>I returned to Mollendo on Tuesday, April 4, and sailing upon the U. S. S.
                            Alaska <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0169"/>had the pleasure of
                            rejoining you in Lima on Friday, the 7th. As Señor Carrillo has arrived
                            in Lima, and as you have conferred with him upon the desires and
                            expectations of his government, it is not necessary for me to elaborate
                            views and present facts with which you are entirely familiar. I desire,
                            however, to say— <list>
                                <item>First. That, so far as I can judge, my journey to La Paz and
                                    conference with the Bolivian minister of foreign affairs was
                                    opportune and productive of good results. A great deal of
                                    importance was apparently attached by the Bolivian Government to
                                    the protocol signed on the 11th of February last by yourself and
                                    Señor Balmaceda. The purport of this paper had been, according
                                    to what Señor Zilveti and Señor Carrillo stated to me, greatly
                                    misunderstood, and they expressed themselves as pleased with my
                                    explanation and with what they at once admitted to be the just
                                    and true meaning of the protocol. I am inclined to think that
                                    the sensitiveness, natural to a small country like Bolivia,
                                    accounted in large measure for the feeling of the government
                                    upon this subject. In all our diplomatic correspoudence, in the
                                    comments of the press of the United States and of Europe, the
                                    war has been constantly spoken of as one between Chili and Peru,
                                    and the implied slight had, in Bolivian public opinion, been
                                    aggravated by the fact that Bolivia was, in the protocol,
                                    referred to only in the most casual manner. This feeling was
                                    sensibly diminished by the fact that you had, on leaving Chili,
                                    at once sent me to La Paz, being unable at that time to make the
                                    journey in person, as I took care to explain to Señor
                                    Zilveti.</item>
                                <item>Second. While the war has, up to this time, not been carried
                                    on within the limits of Bolivia, and she has for this reason
                                    suffered, in comparison with her ally, but slight direct injury,
                                    yet it is of very great importance to the country that either a
                                    truce or peace should be made as speedily as possible. Business
                                    is at a stand-still; exports from the country, which were for a
                                    time entirely suspended, are now permitted by the Chilian
                                    authorities only upon payment of onerous duties, and imports
                                    are, I think, still, or at all events were very recently,
                                    absolutely prohibited. As the government depends for the larger
                                    portion of its revenues upon foreign commerce, and as, owing to
                                    the state of war, a larger army than usual is now being
                                    maintained, the taxation is necessarily increased, and this
                                    naturally tends to produce irritation; the danger of revolution
                                    (always great) is enhanced, and the continuance of orderly
                                    government imperiled. The war has, however, taught the Bolivians
                                    (if such a lesson can be learned in so short a time as has
                                    elapsed since the downfall of Daza, and if I am to believe the
                                    statements of Senor Zilveti) that constitutional and honest
                                    government is a possibility, and the men who are truly
                                    patriotic, and who desire a well-established state, profess
                                    themselves as being greatly encouraged by the present public
                                    feeling in Bolivia.</item>
                                <item>Third. Should it prove impossible to save her present littoral
                                    (the province of Atacama) to Bolivia, and I do not see how this
                                    can be done—and if, as Señor Del Valle and as other prominent
                                    Peruvians with whom I have conversed think, Peru is not willing
                                    to sell or exchange for other territory a portion of her
                                    sea-coast—if, in short, as the result of the war, Bolivia is to
                                    be altogether shut out from the Pacific, then the years of
                                    Bolivia’s existence as an independent nation are few in number.
                                    It is true that Bolivia might rind an outlet for a large part of
                                    her products, and perhaps an inlet for imports by the river
                                    Amazon and the Atlantic Ocean, but for this a large expenditure
                                    of money in the construction of railways and the deepening of
                                    rivers and the lapse of many years for the completion of the
                                    undertaking is necessary; even then her commerce in going to and
                                    from the ocean must pass through other countries, and those
                                    countries may see fit to impose vexatious duties, and impose
                                    other restrictions upon her trade, which would seriously hamper
                                    if not destroy it. Nor, supposing this untrue, are the financial
                                    resources or public credit of Bolivia equal to this undertaking;
                                    and it is more than probable that before its completion,
                                    surrounding states, covetous of her territory, would have
                                    secured her partition.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Moreover, the geographical position of Bolivia requires, in any event, an
                            outlet upon the Pacific. I am aware that for many years her commerce has
                            not sought ingress and egress by way of her own sea-coast. The ports of
                            Mollendo and Arica have offered superior advantages, but Atacama has
                            proved a valuable check upon Peru, and has prevented her from seriously
                            overtaxing Bolivian imports and exports, fearful lest, should she do so,
                            the country’s trade would desert Mollendo and Arica and find refuge in
                            Antofogasta and the other sea-ports of Bolivia. Compacts and agreements
                            were made between the two countries, by which a certain portion of the
                            revenues collected from Bolivian goods at Peruvian ports was to be paid
                            to the former country. At the outbreak of the war, Peru owed Bolivia on
                            this account more than four hundred thousand silver soles (Peruvian
                            dollars). This fact serves to show how unsatisfactory in the past, and
                            how probably unsatisfactory in the future, would be any commercial
                            treaties giving to Bolivia only outlet and inlet through Peru.</p>
                        <p>Without considering the question as to whether it is best for the
                            interests of the United States and of the world that the nationality of
                            Bolivia should be preserved, I venture to express the opinion that the
                            most feasible way by which, at the present time, her dismemberment can
                            be avoided is by a strong and effective confederation between Peru and
                            Bolivia, preserving to each an independent national existence, but <pb
                                n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0170"/>making such an identity of
                            interest as shall render imperative the strict fulfillment of any
                            obligations and treaties into which they may enter. It seems to me that
                            the self-interest of those countries would tend to such an end. Peru
                            fears gradual absorption of her territory by Chili; Bolivia fears her
                            own dismemberment by and division among surrounding nations. Traditions
                            and natural national jealousies would render impossible any close union;
                            self-preservation and resultant benefit would strongly urge upon each
                            the course which I have suggested. I am not unaware of the fact that the
                            interest of Chili would lead her to strongly oppose such a
                            confederation, but, as I have offered this merely in the nature of
                            personal opinion, and as you are better informed than myself, and a
                            better judge of the advantage and practicability of such a political
                            step, I do not consider it necessary to discuss the subject further.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, permit me to observe that I cannot but think it of the
                            greatest importance, both to ourselves and to the belligerents, that the
                            United States should, as speedily as practicable, decide what course it
                            will take with regard to the war of the Pacific. It was most
                            embarrassing not to be able to inform Señor Zilveti and Señor Carrillo
                            of the views of my government, as I felt that the great interests of
                            Bolivia now at stake entitled them to ask and to expect a speedy answer,
                            and I think that, both for our own prestige and as a matter of justice,
                            Bolivia should not be compelled to wait for longer time than is
                            necessary for a definite decision on the part of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I further recommend that for the future our minister to Bolivia should be
                            kept fully informed as to the policy of his government and of any action
                            which may be taken by his colleagues at Lima and at Santiago. The
                            unfortunately almost directly contradictory official communications made
                            at one time by our ministers to Chili and Peru would have made the
                            position of General Adams, in Bolivia, had he not fortunately been
                            absent on leave, extremely embarrassing. Without full knowledge and
                            concert of action on the part of our diplomatic representatives any
                            final settlement by our government or any assistance in the solution of
                            this question is rendered almost impossible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that we
                            arrived in the harbor of Mollendo on Sunday, the 26th instant, between
                            two and three o’clock in the afternoon. Mr. Cochran, the agent of the
                            Mollendo and Puno Railway at that place, visited the ship shortly after
                            our arrival, and most kindly placed the facilities of his road at our
                            disposition. Learning that General Adams was at Arequipa, I telegraphed
                            him to await me at that point, and, in accordance with arrangements made
                            by Mr. Cochran, left Mollendo by special train at eight o’clock Monday
                            morning, Captain Belknap and servant, Lieutenant Hale, and Dr. Whiting,
                            of the United States steamer Alaska, accompanying Mr. Cuthbert Trescot
                            and myself. Half way between Mollendo and Arequipa we were met by
                            General Adams, who accompanied us to Arequipa, where we arrived about
                            four o’clock in the afternoon. On arriving we were met by the adjutant
                            of Señor Carrillo (now the representative in this section of the
                            government of Vice-President Montero), who accompanied us to our hotel.
                            This morning Señor Carrillo called upon us in person, and I have just
                            come from returning his visit. We have been received with great courtesy
                            and cordiality by all the officials of the government, and those
                            connected with the railway have very kindly placed at our disposition
                            all the facilities afforded by their line.</p>
                        <p>By appointment, I this morning met Señor Juan C. Carrillo and had a Iong
                            conference with him. He was formerly minister of foreign affairs of
                            Bolivia, and represented that country at the Arica conference. He is now
                            accredited by Bolivia as minister near the Governments of Peru and
                            Chili, and is thus far on his way to those countries. Señor Carrillo
                            began by saying that he desired to speak with all frankness and
                            confidence, in which I told him I would heartily concur. He then asked
                            General Adams to read me a letter which he had on the twenty-fifth
                            instant addressed to the general, a copy and translation of which you
                            will find inclosed, marked inclosures 1 and 2. Having listened to the
                            translation of the letter by General Adams, I replied in substance as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“In order, Señor Carrillo, to make a satisfactory and full explanation of
                            and answer to the question contained in your letter, I will begin by
                            recalling to your mind that after the failure of the conference at Arica
                            the United States still persisted in its effort to <pb n="99"
                                xml:id="pg_99" facs="0171"/>bring about a peace between Peru,
                            Bolivia, and Chili. As the instructions given to Mr. Trescot have been
                            made public, I Can refer to them without embarrassment. From them you
                            will have learned that the government of Garcia Calderon was recognized
                            in Peru by the United States, as the latter power understood that such
                            recognition was desired by Chili and would tend toward the establishment
                            of peace. After the said government had been so recognized by the United
                            States, Chili, without explanation and without notification to the
                            United States, arrested Garcia Calderon and carried him as prisoner to
                            Chili. You will, I think, agree with me that this act, thus unexplained,
                            and in view of the attendant circumstances stated in Mr. Trescot’s
                            instructions, might well seem like one of intentional insult to the
                            United States. Mr. Trescot’s was, therefore, instructed to frankly state
                            to Chili the view which the United States was forced to hold of this
                            arrest, and to request of the Government of Chili an explanation. This
                            lay at the threshold of Mr. Trescot’s mission, and was the first point
                            discussed in his interview with Señor Balmaceda. After this had been
                            fully discussed, and Chili had made explanation (and I beg you, sir, to
                            remark that this question was one wholly and only concerning Chili and
                            my government), the conversation turned upon what terms Chili was
                            disposed to offer to Peru as a basis of peace. The conclusions thus
                            reached were afterward summarized in the protocol to which you have
                            referred in your letter. And here I beg you to observe that a protocol
                            of this nature does not differ from a written memorandum of
                            conversation, not being in any sense, as you seem to have understood, a
                            contract or binding agreement. It is not with us the custom to seal such
                            memoranda, but Señor Balmaceda stated that it was the diplomatic usage
                            in South America so to do, and Mr, Trescot assented to it, observing
                            that the seal could add nothing to its force.</p>
                        <p>“It will perhaps, however, be more satisfactory to examine the protocol
                            itself, which states: <list>
                                <item>“First. The question of Garcia Calderon, which is of interest
                                    only to the United States and Chili, is disposed of.</item>
                                <item>“Second. The question of armed intervention (in effect a
                                    declaration of war) is not within the province of diplomacy, and
                                    is, therefore, not contemplated by the mission of Mr. Trescot. I
                                    cannot but think that such a question is never within the
                                    purview of any diplomatic mission.</item>
                                <item>“Third. The United States will offer mediation (which is
                                    almost identical with arbitration) only when conducive to the
                                    good of all the belligerents, and when asked by all. Chili
                                    states that she does not desire it, and therefore the United
                                    States does not offer it.</item>
                                <item>“Fourth. Referring to the question of good offices Chili
                                    states that if the United States will offer them on the bases
                                    proposed by herself (Chili), all facilities at her command in
                                    Peru shall be extended to Mr. Trescot.</item>
                                <item>“Fifth. The terms on which Chili will make peace with Peru are
                                    stated.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>“Finally, it is stated that Mr. Trescot thought it best to telegraph to
                            his government as to whether the good offices should be offered on the
                            conditions named, and awaits a reply, which reply forming part of the
                            protocol and published at the same time, is stated in Mr. Trescot’s
                            letter to Señor Balmaceda. The effect of this reply, you will at once
                            see, was to render the whole protocol blank paper, for in any event and
                            on any supposition, but the first three articles can be regarded as in
                            any way binding, and of these the first states simply a question which
                            concerns the United States and Chili alone, and the second and third
                            enunciate principles recognized in all international law. Mr. Trescot
                            was, therefore, entirely correct when he wrote to Mr. Adams what I now
                            state to you, that nothing had been signed which in any way bound the
                            United States as to its action in this matter.</p>
                        <p>“Further, permit me to say that this will fully explain why Bolivia is
                            not mentioned in the protocol, for it is evident that if the United
                            States could not offer its good offices to bring about peace with Peru
                            on the bases proposed by Chili, there was no need of discussing the
                            Bolivian question. If the offer of Chili with regard to Peru was
                            accepted, then the Bolivian question would naturally come up next in
                            order for discussion.</p>
                        <p>“One matter further: The United States has replied to Mr. Trescot’s
                            telegram, stating that she cannot offer good offices or take any part in
                            bringing about a peace based upon both money indemnification and a
                            cession of territory, and that the question as to the future action of
                            the United States has been referred to Congress, and while awaiting the
                            decision of that body it has seemed good to Mr. Trescot to himself go to
                            Peru and to send me to Bolivia, in order to ascertain the intentions and
                            desires of those governments with regard to peace.</p>
                        <p>“I ought perhaps to add that it was not intended that the protocol
                            referred to should be made public, but, the essential portions having
                            been published in the United States by some mistake (as they were
                            communicated in a confidential dispatch), Mr. Trescot did not consider
                            that he could refuse permission to Señor Balmaceda to publish the entire
                            document.”</p>
                        <p>Señor Carrillo thereupon replied that he was pleased to hear my
                            explanation, and that <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0172"/>he would
                            state to me with frankness and in confidence what were the views of his
                            government and people. He said that they had been led to believe from
                            the declarations of Mr. Hurlbut in Peru (for during the time Mr. Adams
                            was absent from Bolivia) that the United States would not, in any event,
                            permit peace upon the basis of annexation of territory, and that Bolivia
                            had patiently awaited the result of the influence of the United States,
                            not expecting a forcible intervention, but led to believe that our
                            government would lend its moral influence, as it had done with so much
                            effect in the case of Mexico; that after his return to Bolivia, in the
                            early part of January last, Mr. Adams had informed the government of the
                            mission of Mr. Trescot, and had requested, to which the government had
                            cheerfully acceded, that pending the result of your negotiations in
                            Santiago things might remain <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi>; that
                            just about this time Señor Baptista had been sent as delegate from
                            Bolivia to the proposed congress in Central America, and that secret
                            instructions had been given him to converse, while on his journey, with
                            any men of prominence with whom he might meet in Chili or Peru, that he
                            might inform the Government of Bolivia as to the views of these
                            countries with regard to peace; that at Tacna, Señor Baptista had met
                            Señor Lillo, who, on behalf of Chili, had proposed that peace should be
                            made between his government and Bolivia, to which Señor Baptista replied
                            that his government would not make peace, save after consultation with
                            and with the approval of Peru, and had suggested, speaking for himself,
                            that it seemed best to make a truce rather than a peace; that
                            conferences had been held, and that certain conclusions, subject to the
                            approval of his government, had been assented to by Señor Baptista, but
                            that the Government of Bolivia would never have agreed to peace, even
                            with the consent of Peru, and this independent of any suggestion or
                            request on the part of Mr. Adams. He also gave me to understand that
                            Chili had offered to cede Tacna, Arica, and Pisagua to Bolivia (all this
                            territory being Peruvian), in exchange for Atacama. Further continuing,
                            Señor Carrillo said that we could not regard it as strange, in view of
                            the attitude of the United States, if Bolivia felt that the time had
                            arrived when it was wise for her to make the best terms possible for
                            herself and by herself, supposing that the United States had finally
                            withdrawn from the question.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I did not understand that the United States had as yet
                            definitely decided its future policy, and requested him to state to me
                            the intentions of Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In answer, he said that he would state them frankly, but begged that his
                            views might be regarded as personal and confidential. He said that,
                            first, it might be advantageous to consider that the same results could
                            be brought about, without offending either Peru or Bolivia, by a careful
                            use of language. For example, Bolivia could cede territory to Chili,
                            provided it was regarded as in lieu of a money indemnity, and not as a
                            right of conquest; for to affirm the latter proposition to be a
                            recognized principle would, in effect, place the territory of Bolivia at
                            the mercy of any nation stronger than herself, rather than do which she
                            would prefer the immediate termination of a national existence. I
                            replied that I thought that I could safely affirm that my government
                            would never take part in any negotiation for peace which recognized
                            cession of territory, without any other consideration, as the legitimate
                            result of victory in war. He then added that it was absolutely essential
                            to Bolivia to have a free and independent outlet and inlet upon the
                            Pacific, the reasons for which he detailed, but which it is not
                            necessary for me now to repeat. With these considerations as premises,
                            he thought his government would make peace on the following conditions: <list>

                                    result of the war, a new demarkation of boundaries between the
                                    three nations has become necessary, and that the natural
                                    affinity of Atacama to Chili, arising from population and
                                    proximity, may be regarded in settling the demarkation.</item>

                                    Caupolican, bordering upon Lake Titicaca and contiguous to Peru,
                                    and possibly would assume a portion of her debt or pay an
                                    additional compensation in money, the details to be hereafter
                                    arranged between the two countries.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Reverting to previous conversation, Señor Carrillo then inquired as to
                            what I thought would be the attitude of my government upon the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I could not form an opinion; that it was within the
                            bounds of possibility that Congress, to which body I understood that the
                            question had been referred, might decide to withdraw altogether, or to
                            intervene with effect; that I had no information or intimation on which
                            to predicate an opinion; that, possibly, so indefinite a. reply might be
                            somewhat embarrassing to his government, but that a definite decision
                            would, in all probability, be reached by the United States in a short
                            time, and that it did not seem to me that a maintenance of affairs <hi
                                rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> for a limited period could seriously
                            hamper or prove detrimental to Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>In this he concurred and informed me that he was accredited both to Chili
                            and Peru, and, for the purpose of conferring with you and with the
                            Government of Peru, would <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0173"
                            />gladly at once proceed to Lima, but was prevented from doing so for
                            certain reasons. (See my dispatch numbered 2.) He also said that he was
                            empowered by his government, on the understanding that the United States
                            had entirely withdrawn from the question, to request the aid of the
                            Argentine Republic, Brazil, or any other American power, and failing in
                            this to request the intervention of Europe, and inquired of me what
                            opinion my government would entertain of the latter course.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the traditional policy of the United States had ever
                            viewed with disfavor European intervention upon this hemisphere, and
                            that unless this policy had been radically overturned (of which I was
                            not informed), it could not but view such a step with disfavor. This was
                            the substance of our conversation.</p>
                        <p>I inquired of Señor Carrillo as to whether I was at liberty to refer to
                            it in the conference which I hope to have in La Paz with Señor Zilveti,
                            Bolivian minister of foreign affairs, to which he replied that, though
                            he did not doubt that I would find Señor Zil-veti’s opinions to be
                            identical, he preferred that the latter should express them voluntarily
                            and spontaneously. I therefore take advantage of the mail, which I am
                            informed leaves to-morrow for Callao, to send this for your guidance and
                            information, and will report further after my return from La Paz.</p>
                        <p>I have concluded to go thither, and shall leave for Puno at six o’clock
                            to-morrow morning. I have made arrangements which will, I trust, bring
                            me to Mollendo on Monday or Tuesday next, and shall join you in Lima as
                            quickly as possible. It seems to me to be more respectful to proceed to
                            the Bolivian capital, and I cannot but think it extremely doubtful as to
                            whether you will personally be able to go there.</p>
                        <p>There are some incidental questions as to the effect of the Balmaceda
                            protocol in Bolivia and other matters touched upon in our conversation,
                            to which I do not now deem it necessary to refer, but which I will
                            hereafter explain to you, either orally or in writing.</p>
                        <p>I have written hastily, but I trust I have made myself intelligible, and
                            that what I said and its results may meet with your approval.</p>

                            minister plenipotentiary of Bolivia accredited near the Government of
                            Peru, is informed of the early arrival of Mr. Walker Blaine at the port
                            of Mollendo, charged with a special mission from the United States, in
                            order to have an interview with your excellency, and, as the distance
                            prevents the Government of Bolivia from taking advantage of this
                            opportunity to obtain some data necessary to the development of its
                            policy, the undersigned takes the liberty of asking your excellency to
                            please to make clear in the said interview the points contained in this
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>In the protocol of the 11th of February last, signed by the Chilian
                            minister of foreign affairs and his excellency Mr. W. H. Trescot,
                            special envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United
                            States of America, it is stated that “the mediation (of the United
                            States) does not conform to the convenience of the belligerents, nor is
                            it solicited by Chili,” and it is added that, eliminating from all
                            discussion the possibility of armed intervention, the United States
                            “will offer its mediation only in case that the belligerents shall
                            manifest a desire of obtaining it, and when its acceptance will conduce
                            to results satisfactory to both.” At the same time it is declared, in
                            the third clause, that the <hi rend="italic">mediation of the United
                                States is a point eliminated from all discussion and definitely
                                concluded</hi></p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding that the allied governments have shown by their official
                            acts a respectful deference to the conciliatory policy of the United
                            States, confiding in its efficacious influence for the restoration of
                            peace, the declaration just recited leads one to consider that the new
                            action upon which the government of your excellency entered, after the
                            conference at Arica, in the present international conflict upon the
                            Pacific, is definitely ended and withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>This consideration and the fact that no mention is made of the republic
                            of Bolivia in the conference at Santiago, nor in the agreement signed at
                            Viña del Mar, notwithstanding that, in consequence of the declarations
                            made by your excellency in your respectful note of the 10th of January
                            last, addressed to the Bolivian cabinet, all action was suspended until
                            the result of the mission of Mr. Trescot should be made known, have
                            determined the undersigned to interest your excellency in order that, in
                            your approaching interview with Mr. Blaine, the reasons may, so far as
                            possible, be made clear why Bolivia was not mentioned in the matters
                            already referred to, and at the same <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102"
                                facs="0174"/>time a declaration may be obtained as to the true
                            meaning and extent of the conclusions of the aforesaid protocol relative
                            to the mediation of the Government of the United States with regard to
                            the three belligerent nations. The undersigned does not doubt that your
                            excellency will entertain the present suggestion, as it will show the
                            Government of Bolivia another proof of that delicate attention which
                            your excellency has shown in the discharge of the duties of your high
                            office.</p>

                        <p>In the city of La Paz, on the 1st of April, 1882, in accordance with an
                            agreement made the previous day, Mr. Walker Blaine with General Adams,
                            minister resident of the United States, met Doctor Pedro José Zilveti,
                            in the office of the minister of foreign affairs for Bolivia. The
                            minister commenced by asking Mr. Blaine what character they would give
                            to the interview, to which he replied that he had instructions from the
                            plenipotentiary, Mr. Trescot, to ascertain the opinions and intentions
                            of the Government of Bolivia, and that the conference would, therefore,
                            be entirely confidential.</p>
                        <p>Señor Zilveti having signified his wish to know the extent and importance
                            of the protocol of February 11th, signed by Messrs. Trescot and
                            Balmaceda, Mr. Blaine made the same statements that he did, in reference
                            to this matter, in his interview of March 28th with Señor Carrillo,
                            stating, therefore, as a conclusion, that there was entire freedom of
                            action for American diplomacy, in conformity with the friendly character
                            of its relations towards the three belligerent nations. Señor Zilveti
                            was permitted to ask Mr. Blaine what position the United States would
                            take if Chili persisted in demanding the conditions of peace set forth
                            in the protocol of the llth of February, which on the part of Bolivia
                            are absolutely inadmissible. The reply was as follows: the government of
                            the United States sincerely desires the cessation of the actual war, but
                            does not find itself in a position to itself assume a warlike attitude
                            because it does not desrie to make war, nor do the American people
                            desire it; that for this reason, if the indicated conditions were not
                            modified and the demand of cession of territory were maintained by Chili
                            as the right of a conqueror and as a condition, <hi rend="italic">sine
                                qua non</hi>, of a settlement, the Government of the United States
                            could do nothing more than to retire completely. (See foot note.) Señor
                            Zilveti replied that he did not think that the point could be reached.
                            That the United States would have to declare war against Chili, because
                            one determined word from the former government would suffice to bring
                            the conqueror to reason and make him consent to an equitable and
                            satisfactory arrangement. He called attention, besides, to the fact that
                            the retirement of the United States in such a case would make worse the
                            condition of the allies and make another victory for Chili.</p>
                        <p>Señor Zilveti, being asked upon what base Bolivia would enter into an
                            arrangement for the cessation of the present war which causes so much
                            injury to the belligerents, replied, that, according to the conditions
                            imposed by Chili, it would amount to a perpetual closing in of Bolivia,
                            its deprivation of every outlet upon the Pacific, and its consequent
                            death; that Bolivia could accept no such arrangement, preferring to
                            indefinitely maintain a defensive attitude; but that, in his opinion, a
                            preliminary arrangement for peace might be made, recognizing the right
                            to a just indemnity, the mode and payment of which would be matter for a
                            future international contract, the express declaration being made that
                            the right of conquest was not recognized, and that this must be done
                            without impairing the loyalty which Bolivia owes Peru, in accordance
                            with their treaty of alliance.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the case of an absolute impossibility of arriving at any
                            definite agreement, and of the wisdom of stipulating for an armistice or
                            temporary truce, Mr. Blaine asked on what conditions Bolivia would
                            accept it. Señor Zilveti replied that he could not say with certainty
                            what these conditions would be, but, as his own private opinion, he
                            might say that, in the event of treating for a truce jointly with Peru,
                            the war occupation should be limited to the department of Tarapacá and
                            the littoral of Bolivia, a neutral zone should be determined, liberty
                            and necessary guarantees given that Peru may be organized in a stable
                            manner, and liberty of commerce accorded to Bolivia, through its own and
                            Peruvian ports, in accordance with the existing treaties between the two
                            nations. Señor Zilveti having asked if it was true that Mr. Trescot, in
                            his special mission, expected new instructions from his government, and
                            if they would be soon communicated, Mr. Blaine replied that they were
                            actually expected, but that they could not be given until after the
                            Congress of the United States, to which the question had been submitted
                            for its consideration, should have passed upon it, and that he thought
                            it improbable that this would be done immediately, since to obtain more
                            exact <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0175"/>information Mr. Hurlbut
                            had been summoned home, and was to leave Lima on the 6th of April.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the mission of Señor Carrillo, with whom Mr. Blaine had
                            conversed in Arequipa, Señor Zilveti stated that if Chili sincerely
                            wished to enter into an arrangement leading to a solution of the present
                            conflict, she would give Señor Carrillo a passport and the necessary
                            guarantees that he might put himself in communication with the
                            Government of Peru, to which he has been accredited. Mr. Blaine said
                            that he thought so, too, and had, on his part, addressed Mr. Trescot
                            from Arequipa, recommending him to obtain from the Chilian authorities
                            all the guarantees wished for, that Señor Carrillo might proceed to the
                            fulfillment of his mission.</p>
                        <p>Here the confidential interview, of which this is a brief summary,
                            ended.</p>

                                her claim to the cession of Tarapacà, unless compelled to do so by a
                                manifestation on the part of the United States of a purpose to force
                                her to that determination; that neither the people nor the
                                Government of the United States had ever contemplated the
                                possibility of assuming a warlike attitude.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In dispatch No. 24, dated Lima, May 3, 1882, I
                        inclosed an account of my interviews with Señor Alvarez, the Peruvian
                        Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and the letter which in consequence I
                        addressed to the Chilian Government.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of that letter was to urge upon the Chilian Government the
                        acceptance of the preliminary conditions which the Peruvian Government
                        thought necessary to the initiation of a serious negotiation for peace.</p>
                    <p>The conditions were: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>That General Montero should be recognized as the executive head of
                                an actual government.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>That, under the provisions of a short truce, he should be afforded
                                the opportunity to convene the National Congress at Arequipa, in
                                order that he might receive from it the authority necessary for the
                                conclusion of a peace.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>My reasons for the representation made to the Chilian Government in this
                        connection have been so fully stated in my dispatch to the Department, and
                        in the communication to the Chilian Government, that they need not now be
                        repeated.</p>
                    <p>It only remains for me to state what consideration has so far been given to
                        the proposed conditions.</p>
                    <p>For reasons which have been stated in former dispatches, I was obliged to
                        leave Lima before my communication in its formal shape could reach the
                        Chilian Government at Santiago. But that government has in Lima a diplomatic
                        representative in the person of Señor Novoa, who is authorized to consider
                        any propositions tending to a negotiation for peace.</p>
                    <p>The whole subject was fully discussed with him and General Lynch, the
                        military commander of the Chilian army of occupation, and the propositions,
                            <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0176"/>with the substance of the
                        conference, were telegraphed by Señor Novoa to his government.</p>
                    <p>I do not regard the telegraphic reply which was communicated by Señor Novoa
                        as conclusive. My dispatches had not yet reached the Chilian Government, and
                        I think it clear that the bare statement of the propositions had not put the
                        Chilian Government in full possession of the considerations which
                        recommended their adoption. I have other reasons for believing that the
                        question is still an open one.</p>
                    <p>The reply of the Government of Chili, as communicated by Señor Novoa,
                        intimated: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>That as no active military operations were being conducted by the
                                Chilian army, there was no apparent necessity for a truce. But it is
                                obvious that, as Arequipa is open at any moment to occupation by the
                                Chilian troops from Mollendo, the Peruvian Congress would naturally
                                and properly require some guarantee that its deliberations should be
                                free and uninterrupted. A repetition of the dissolution of Congress
                                because its deliberations were not agreeable to the Chilian
                                Government is a contingency which the Congress, in view of the past,
                                could scarcely disregard, and which would make any effort at
                                negotiation only another unfortunate failure. Beside which, if there
                                are, and are to be, no active military operations, there can be no
                                possible danger or inconvenience to Chili in giving such a condition
                                of things the sanction of a formal agreement by a short
                                notice.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>While the Chilian Government desired peace, it was unwilling to
                                enter upon negotiation without distinct agreement in advance of the
                                terms which must be accepted. It was dissatisfied with the
                                experience of its former attempts at negotiation with the Calderon
                                government and was indisposed to renew the effort without the
                                certainty of a successful result. It was willing, therefore, to
                                negotiate informally with General Montero, and upon the signature of
                                satisfactory preliminaries would recognize the existence of the
                                Peruvian Government, <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>, with the
                                execution of the treaty.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>But the Congress which had authorized General Montero to negotiate had
                        expressly forbidden any cesson of territory, and it was, therefore, simply
                        impossible for General Montero to sign a treaty containing such provisions.
                        After some discussion Señor Novoa expressed his willingness to accept a
                        preliminary agreement by which General Montero would bind himself to submit
                        for approval, to the National Congress, such a treaty as he and Señor Novoa
                        could agree upon, and to recognize General Montero’s government upon the
                        execution of such an instrument. This would have afforded an opportunity for
                        the opening of negotiations, but Señor Novoa added the limitation that if
                        the Congress did not approve the treaty so submitted, the recognition would
                        be withdrawn. This was simply an impossible condition. The recognition of
                        the Montero government had to be positive. If Congress failed to approve,
                        Chili could still prosecute the war until Peru was compelled to accept her
                        terms, but such a contingent recognition was in fact only the old
                        proposition of a treaty before recognition in another and much more
                        illogical and embarrassing shape. Señor Novoa was willing to adopt another
                        method. He would sign a treaty with General Montero to be submitted and
                        approved by the municipalities; that is, by the local authorities of the
                        separate provinces. Such a method was entirely beyond General Montero’s
                        constitutional powers, and would, I think, have led to the renewal of the
                        differences between the various parties in Peru, who, accepting General
                        Montero as the legitimate representative of the government, would acquiesce
                        in the regular action of the Executive and Congress.</p>
                    <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0177"/>
                    <p>As Señor Novoa was either indisposed or unauthorized to move out of this
                        vicious circle, our conferences terminated.</p>
                    <p>I regret this the more as I think the propositions offered a fair prospect of
                        a serious negotiation. Chili cannot obtain a peace which will give sanction
                        and title to her acquisition of territory without the recognition of a
                        legitimate government in Peru. Without a treaty with such authority the
                        acquisition will be simply one of force to be maintained as it has been
                        acquired. The recognition of General Montero’s government will place upon
                        him, and upon the people of Peru, the responsibility of making or rejecting
                        peace, while the calling of Congress will afford the opportunity to those
                        who desire peace to do what they cannot do under present
                        circumstances—organize a party which can exert its influence directly,
                        effectively, and legitimately in the Congress itself.</p>
                    <p>But I cannot with justice conclude this dispatch without saying that I
                        believe the reason which induces the hesitation of Chili is that she
                        believes that, so long as the Peruvians are convinced that the United States
                        will finally intervene, they never will negotiate in earnest.</p>
                    <p>It is unquestionably true that the Peruvian Government does believe that the
                        United States will intervene; at any rate they consider that the question of
                        intervention, as one of their leading officials expressed it to me, was
                        still a pending question.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that neither Chili nor Peru will approach the solution of their
                        difficulties in the proper spirit, or with any hope of a result satisfactory
                        to both, as long as this impression lasts.</p>
                    <p>If the United States intend to intervene effectively to prevent the
                        disintegration of Peru, the time has come when that intention should be
                        avowed. If it does not, still more urgent is the necessity that Chili and
                        Peru should understand exactly where the action of the United States ends.
                        It would be entirely beyond my duty to discuss the character or the
                        consequences of either line of conduct, but I trust that you will not deem
                        that I am going beyond that duty in impressing upon the government that the
                        present position of the United States is an embarrassment to all the
                        belligerents, and that it should be terminated as promptly as possible.</p>
                    <p>There is another conviction which it is clearly my duty to express. I believe
                        that whenever the United States formally withdraws from further
                        intervention, Peru will apply to the European powers, and that a joint
                        intervention of two or more is probable. It is not for me to anticipate what
                        view the Department will take of such a possibility.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: The representatives of your
                            excellency’s government in Peru, and those of the government of this
                            country, have on various occasions informed your government of the
                            cruelty and the acts of vandalism with which the Chilian forces carry on
                            hostilities against our defenseless people. The recital of a portion of
                            these acts of barbarity has now been published, being contained in the
                            volume of official documents published by your excellency’s government,
                            in relation to the war on the Pacific coast. The Hon. Mr. Christiancy,
                            in giving an account of these acts, refers to them with deep emotion. I
                            will quote a few passages from his communications:</p>
                        <p>“Last week a Chilian force of from two to three thousand men marched from
                            Ilo to Mollendo, and with some marines who were near, or who arrived
                            there about that time, they completely burned, sacked, and destroyed the
                            town, railway, and railway station, wantonly destroying the lives of
                            peaceable inhabitants.”</p>
                        <p>“The orders given by the Chilian Government to their fleet to destroy all
                            the Peruvian ports can hardly be carried out without great inhumanity
                            and even barbarity, and that towards neutrals.” (March 23, 1880, page
                            325.)</p>
                        <p>Referring to other outrages, he says:</p>
                        <p>“This mode of carrying on the war by Chili has produced a strong feeling
                            here among all the representatives of foreign powers.</p>
                        <p>“I shall readily join in protesting against all such means as are
                            supported only by savage or semi-barbarous practices of past ages, but
                            condemned by the more humane codes of modern warfare. Humanity has some
                            rights even higher than those of belligerents.” (March 24, 1880, page
                            327.)</p>
                        <p>“This is not war, but deliberate, wholesale murder, unprovoked by
                            anything yet done by the allied forces, and, in the cause of
                            civilization and humanity, calls for an indignant protest from all
                            civilized nations.” (July 5, 1880, page 330.)</p>
                        <p>“If Chili chooses to employ savages as soldiers she must be held
                            responsible before the world for all such excesses as would not have
                            been committed by a civilized soldiery under proper discipline.”
                            (February 2, 1881, page 438.)</p>
                        <p>Your excellency sees for yourself in the vicinity of Lima the traces of
                            this barbarous warfare.</p>
                        <p>It now becomes my painful duty to call your excellency’s attention to a
                            fresh outrage of this kind, which has just been committed in the
                            province of Jauja by the Chilian forces which are overrunning that
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The commander of those forces, whose name is E. del Ganto, sent on the
                            6th of April last an artful communication to various towns in that
                            province, telling them that the Chilian forces had not come for the
                            purpose of making war upon the poor, but upon the rich, so as to compel
                            them to sue for peace. (Inclosure No. 1.)</p>
                        <p>The object of this communistic proclamation was to induce the Indians to
                            plunder the property of the wealthy classes in order that the Chilian
                            forces might thus be supplied with beef cattle. To this wily missive
                            intimidation was added, Mr. del Canto informing the Indians that he had
                            caused their principal men in those districts to be placed under
                            arrest.</p>
                        <p>Finding that his insinuations were of no avail, del Canto proceeded to
                            commit an act of the most barbarous cruelty. He invaded those
                            defenseless villages with a force of two thousand men and butchered the
                            inhabitants, without sparing either age or sex. He drove those who
                            escaped the murderous knife to the mountains, thus depriving them of
                            shelter and of every means of subsistence. (Inclosure No. 2.)</p>
                        <p>The inclosed copies of reports received by the government will give your
                            excellency a fuller view of these horrors. These copies are not
                            authenticated, because the parties who sent them feared the evils to
                            which they would have been subjected if the papers had been
                            intercepted.</p>
                        <p>It seems scarcely credible, the war being <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            at an end, for the simple reason that Peru is unable to continue it, and
                            in presence of your excellency’s mission of peace, that such acts of
                            atrocity are possible.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will observe that this officer, del Canto, molds the
                            policy of his government in the most inhuman manner.</p>
                        <p>The revelation of such cruel proceedings and of such wicked purposes
                            will, I hope, be an additional incentive to your excellency’s government
                            to increase its laudable efforts to bring about a peace without
                            usurpations on the part of Chili. It is not possible that your
                            excellency’s government should witness unmoved the execution of this
                            horrible design: “Either the conquest of a portion of our territory or
                            the butchery of its inhabitants.” It cannot be that these atrocities are
                            to go on year after year before the very eyes of the United States in
                            spite of their denunciation by the Hon. Mr, Christiancy.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time I likewise hope that your excellency, with the sense of
                            justice which characterizes you, will for the honor of humanity
                            endeavor, so far as you are able, to put an end to these revolting
                            deeds.</p>
                        <p>With sentiments of the most distinguished consideration, I am,

                        <p>The Chilian forces have not come to make war upon or to oppress the poor.
                            The sole object of their coming has been to compel the rich to sue for

                            subsistence of the Chilian forces.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The last steamer from A spin wall brought
                            the following authentic news:</p>
                        <p>Señor Lizardo Montero issued a proclamation at Cajamarca, on the 15th of
                            November, stating that he assumes the Presidency of Peru and enforcing
                            the continuance of the state of active war against Chili. According to
                            that proclamation, the capital of the republic was to be the inland town
                            of Cajamarca.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile Señor Andres A. Cáceres, the chieftain of the guerrilla bands
                            stationed at Chosica, was proclaimed President by his troops. He also
                            issued a proclamation, under the date of the 24th of November, in which
                            he acknowledges the country to be in a state of anarchy; resigns, for
                            the present, the Presidency, till the people may freely elect a
                            President; and retains, meanwhile, the political and military government
                            of the central provinces.</p>
                        <p>Señor Cáceres says also that the state of war is vigorously maintained,
                            and that he hopes the Peruvians will at last vanquish their foe. Señor
                            Cáceres does not declare whom he judges to be chief of the nation, but
                            he confines himself to disowning the authority of Piérola.</p>
                        <p>As to the rest, the old personal political parties of the country are
                            entirely disorganized, disrupted, and in a state of anarchy. I think it
                            to be highly important for your excellency to be acquainted with these
                            facts that may lead you to fully appreciate the condition of affairs in
                            South America.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, sir, &amp;c.,</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 28th ultimo, giving me your views as to the
                            present condition of Peru, derived from your latest intelligence. I need
                            not inform you that it has been read with the most lively interest.</p>

                            our personal interview, that your government, in the arrest and
                            imprisonment of Calderon, was in no way instigated by an unfriendly
                            feeling towards the United States. If you feel yourself at liberty to
                            renew that assurance in writing I shall be still further and greatly
                            gratified by your doing so. Such a communication, written in the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                            excellency’s note of the 7th instant, whereby you were pleased to
                            request me to furnish to you, in writing, the explanations which I had
                            the honor to give you on the occasion of our conference which was held
                            on the 5th instant, in reference to the circumstances which preceded or
                            accompanied the arrest of Don Francisco Garcia Calderon, at Lima, and
                            the bearing which that act might have upon the very friendly and cordial
                            relations which happily exist between your excellency’s government and
                            mine.</p>
                        <p>I thank your excellency for the opportunity which you have thus afforded
                            me to contribute, by means of a plain and unvarnished statement, towards
                            drawing still closer the bonds of sincere friendship which unite our
                            respective countries.</p>
                        <p>I have already taken occasion, verbally, to furnish the explanations
                            which I now have the pleasure to put in writing, three times to Mr.
                            Blaine, your excellency’s honorable predecessor, and once to your
                            excellency. Both Mr. Blaine and your excellency were fully satisfied,
                            and I did not think it necessary to reduce said explanations to writing,
                            because it did not appear to me that the Secretaries of State had
                            attached serious importance to a hypothesis which, in my humble opinion,
                            had no foundation worthy of consideration. Nevertheless, in the
                            memorandum which I had the honor to address to the Department of State
                            on the 21st of November last, I explained all the circumstances relative
                            to the ephemeral government of Garcia Calderon, and stated the
                            incontestable reasons that had existed for its abolition, which reasons
                            are altogether unconnected <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0181"/>with
                            the fact of the recognition of that government by that of your
                            excellency.</p>
                        <p>I must, moreover, remind your excellency that during our interview I
                            called your attention to a very significant incident, which was that a
                            fortnight before the arrest of Garcia Calderon at Lima, I read to the
                            Hon. Mr. Blaine, in the presence of Mr. Hitt, his First Assistant
                            Secretary, a letter addressed to me by Rear-Admiral Lynch, in which the
                            latter stated that if Mr. Garcia Calderon did not yield obedience to the
                            order issued by him (Lynch), forbidding him to perform jurisdictional
                            acts within the lines of the Chilian occupation, he should be obliged to
                            put him under arrest. Admiral Lynch could not know when or how Mr.
                            Garcia Calderon would disobey that order, and when I communicated the
                            contents of the aforesaid note to Mr. Blaine (which I did as an evidence
                            of the most perfect frankness and of the fullest confidence in the
                            sincerity of the friendship of the United States for Chili), I
                            considered the event in question as being a future and contingent one
                            which would probably never come to pass.</p>
                        <p>After the repeated and terrible disasters which Peru had suffered, it
                            seemed that none but a man of very high intellectual and moral qualities
                            could unite the scattered elements of order existing in the country, in
                            order to treat for peace. Peru has always had military governments,
                            which are better respected in countries in which public order stands on
                            no solid foundation; and when the attempt was made to establish a civil
                            government there, it was found impossible to advance beyond the
                            initiatory steps.</p>
                        <p>Chili has never desired to interfere in the domestic politics of her
                            enemy; she has, nevertheless, not failed to study with the deepest
                            interest the character and qualities of the men who have taken, or who
                            might be called to take, a prominent part in public affairs, and who
                            seemed capable of rising to the height which the situation demanded, of
                            holding the reins of government with a firm hand, and of inducing their
                            fellow-citizens to take the only course reserved for them by the laws of
                            war. It was natural, too, that sensible men in Peru should think of
                            seeking and finding the man whom the situation demanded, in order that
                            they might place the destinies of their country in his hands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Garcia Calderon was mentioned, although it was said of him that his
                            character lacked most of the qualities which the circumstances required;
                            that he was not fit to govern, that he was deficient in courage, and
                            that he had no following upon which he could really rely. It was,
                            however, added that he was unstained by peculation or extortion; that he
                            had the reputation of being an excellent lawyer, and that his elevation
                            to power would meet with no serious opposition.</p>
                        <p>My government had no reason to express an opinion with regard to the
                            choice of the person who was to be placed at the head of affairs in
                            Peru. It appeared to it sufficient that Mr. Garcia Calderon enjoyed a
                            good reputation for honesty, and it decided to lend him a certain amount
                            of co-operation and support, in order to furnish him the means and the
                            opportunity to establish his authority.</p>
                        <p>The Chilian plenipotentiaries at Lima informed the future President of
                            Peru what where the conditions of peace, and he accepted them as
                            relatively good, and promised to labor with a view to making them the
                            basis of a treaty.</p>
                        <p>Chili did not recognize, nor was she willing solemnly to recognize,
                            Garcia Calderon’s government, for many reasons. When he asked that his
                            government might be formally recognized, so that he might be enabled to
                            gain some ascendency in public opinion, this was refused, on the <pb
                                n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0182"/>ground that his government did
                            not yet possess any condition of solidity, respectability, or
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the manner in which that provisional President rose to power
                            could not have been more irregular and anomalous than it was, and the
                            position in which he was placed, as regarded his own country and the
                            army of occupation, was still more extraordinary and exceptional. He
                            exercised no jurisdiction save within the limits of the territory which
                            was under the control of the Chilian authorities, and he was under the
                            wing and the moral and material protection of the army of occupation. He
                            might at any time have been arrested by any police officer.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency knows that a government of that kind could not be
                            recognized by that of Chili, which needed, in order to be able to treat,
                            to have a respectable and respected government to treat with, and one
                            that was able really to pledge the faith of its nation.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency’s government, undoubtedly, had more liberty of action
                            than did mine, because it did not need to enter into any ulterior
                            negotiations with the Peruvian Government, and was consequently able to
                            act with greater freedom in contributing to give Garcia Calderon the
                            moral prestige and authority of which he stood in need.</p>
                        <p>Under such auspices, Garcia Calderon began to act in violation of all his
                            previous promises, and was guilty of a series of acts subversive of the
                            legitimate rights and interests of Chili, so that he rendered himself
                            absolutely unworthy of any toleration or indulgence on the part of my
                            government.</p>
                        <p>In the memorandum of November 21, to which I refer, I mentioned four or
                            five of the principal acts which, with evident reason, caused that
                            gentleman to lose the favor of the Chilian Government. In order to avoid
                            repetitions, which would make this communication too long, I will simply
                            refer to what I said in that paper, which I had the honor to transmit to
                            your excellency immediately after your elevation to the high position
                            which you now occupy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Garcia Calderon having been guilty of these offenses, and having
                            openly declared that he would not treat on the bases proposed by Chili,
                            the doom of his government was irrevocably sealed.</p>
                        <p>In the steps subsequently taken by the Government of Chili, that
                            government paid no attention to the proceedings of General Hurlbut, upon
                            which the provisional president of Peru said that he based his
                            reactionary conduct, but acted exclusively in accordance with its own
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>The fact is that my government never believed that General Hurlbut was
                            faithfully interpreting the lofty, considerate, and friendly policy of
                            the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The first step taken by General Lynch (who had been duly authorized to do
                            so) was to deprive Garcia Calderon of the arms which, trusting to his
                            honor, he had lent him. Subsequently, when that gentleman’s attitude
                            became more dangerous, he was dispossessed of the bureaus which he had
                            organized and was peremptorily ordered to perform no governmental or
                            jurisdictional act within the lines of the Chilian occupation. Still
                            later, when he intentionally violated this order, he was arrested and
                            sent to Chili, but was treated with every courtesy and attention.</p>
                        <p>The American General Scott acted, under similar circumstances, in the
                            same manner in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Even if the provisional government had been recognized by all friendly
                            powers, Chili would have had to act as she did, not only for the
                            maintenance of her rights, but from a sense of her own dignity and
                            self-respect. And even if Chili had recognized that government, that
                            circumstance <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0183"/>would not have
                            rendered it inviolable, and she would still have been obliged to act
                            precisely as she did.</p>
                        <p>Consequently I can and do assure your excellency, in the most formal and
                            solemn manner, that my government had not the most remote intention or
                            the slightest purpose to impair, in any way, the state of friendship and
                            cordialty which previously to those events, during the same and
                            subsequently, has existed, and which it has always desired should exist,
                            between it and the Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I likewise had the honor to remark to your excellency, in our interview
                            of the 5th instant, that certain financial schemes had thrown
                            difficulties in the way of the conclusion of peace with Peru, and that
                            while those schemes remained on the carpet it would be difficult to
                            reach the desired solution. I may now add that the parties interested in
                            those operations are endeavoring, both through the public press and such
                            other means as they find available, to predispose the United States
                            against Chili, and that they spare no pains to present the most natural
                            and logical acts of my government in a wrong light.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform your excellency
                            of the latest news received by this legation through the Pacific
                            mail.</p>
                        <p>The fact that Rear-Admiral Montero has deserted from the ranks of his
                            former chief, the dictator Piérola, is fully confirmed. Montero has
                            accepted the vice-presidency of Peru, which was offered to him by
                            several gentlemen of Lima, called <hi rend="italic">notables</hi>. He
                            needed no other investment to call himself the “constitutional
                            president.”</p>
                        <p>As this expression has been lately used in a very extraordinary sense, so
                            that many of the journals of the United States have unconciously made
                            use of it, I deem it necessary to acquaint your excellency with its
                            meaning.</p>
                        <p>The last constitutional president of Peru, that is to say, elected by the
                            people according to the constitution, was General Mariano Ygnacio Prado,
                            whose term came to an end long ago. Those who have succeeded him in
                            exercising the supreme power have been as constitutional as the emperors
                            of the lower empire who had themselves proclaimed by their troops. They
                            are called constitutional presidents, because, after having irregularly
                            assumed the supreme power, they enforce one of the many constitutions
                            which Peru has given to herself since its independence.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency can easily perceive, that is an abuse of the term
                            which tends to pervert every idea of regular government.</p>
                        <p>Not withstanding this, Mr. Hurlbut gave to the provisional government of
                            Garcia Calderon the name of constitutional, and revolutionary to that of
                            Piérola.</p>
                        <p>These pernicious errors ought to give way to a correct and suitable
                            knowledge of persons and things.</p>
                        <p>Montero issued at Cajamarca, a town situated in the northern mountains
                                <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0184"/>of Peru, a circular under
                            the date of 28th of October, 1881, addressed to the governors, stating
                            that he was armed against the invaders, and that he hoped to effect a
                            happy solution of the pending questions by virtue of the effective
                            mediation of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The same chief circulated extensively the strangest document to which it
                            is possible to refer in the history of diplomacy. This was a letter or
                            manifest addressed by General Hurlbut to the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                                >notables</hi> of Lima, which your excellency is acquainted with,
                            but a copy of which is herewith inclosed.</p>
                        <p>The same Mr. Montero wrote to his former chief under date of November
                            22,1881, a letter explaining to him the grounds of his desertion.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Nicholas Piérola gave up his nominal position, by issuing
                            a decree and a proclamation under the date of November 28, 1881.</p>
                        <p>According to the latest news, the troops under Montero do not amount to
                            more than 1,500 or 1,600 men, poorly armed and equipped.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency can see, that is but a sad comedy.</p>
                        <p>The so-called provisional president, Señor Francisco Garcia Calderon, is
                            at present in the town of Quillota, in the province of Valparaiso,
                            Chili.</p>
                        <p>Caceres, the chief of the <hi rend="italic">Monteneros</hi>, is in
                            Chosica, a short distance from Lima. He has not declared himself in any
                            way, and we have every reason to believe that he will act on his own
                            account and at his own risk, and will presently recognize the
                            proclamation made to him by his own army, which does not exceed three
                            thousand or three thousand five hundred men. The existence of this
                            leader is virtually dependent on the will of the Chilian
                            general-in-chief, who can annihilate him whenever he chooses to attack
                            him.</p>
                        <p>As regards Mr. Piérola, he is at present in Lima, the report of his
                            having sailed for Europe having proved incorrect He is living
                            tranquilly, as a private citizen, under the security afforded by the
                            protection of the Chilian army of occupation.</p>
                        <p>It is clearly evident that whenever the Chilian army shall abandon the
                            Peruvian capital anarchy will begin its disastrous work, and for this
                            the Peruvians alone are responsible.</p>
                        <p>My government had an army in readiness to proceed to Arequipa, in order
                            to clear the situation, and thus facilitate the securing of peace; but
                            it has lately desisted from this purpose because it felt that the purely
                            local results to be secured would not correspond to the sacrifices which
                            a new campaign involved.</p>
                        <p>An expedition, however, is ready to march to Janja, and will put an end
                            to its occupation by Cáceres. This will only leave Rear-Admiral Montero
                            in the north of Peru. He is without prestige, without arms, without
                            resources, and with no other territory over which to exercise his
                            authority than that on which he treads.</p>
                        <p>If the sensible people still remaining in Peru do not see that the time
                            has arrived to accept the conditions which Chili, with perfect justice,
                            demands, they will bring upon their country all the consequences of that
                            obstinate and incomprehensible resistance. I do not believe that there
                            is in the history of the world an instance of a country which, being so
                            impotent to defend itself, showed itself so blindly stubborn <gap
                                quantity="3" unit="words"/>nduring the laws.of war. Everything which
                            in any way tends to strengthen that resistance is, and will be, contrary
                            to the principles which govern human affairs.</p>
                        <p>General Lynch, seeing that all the branches of municipal revenues <pb
                                n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0185"/>were in complete disorder and
                            that their management was irregular, ordered the appointment of a
                            supervisor, a measure which degraded the municipals, who, in
                            consequence, threatened to resign their posts. The journals have indeed
                            published the fact that the alcalde Canevaro, and other municipals, had
                            resigned, but we are not aware that such is the case.</p>
                        <p>The Bolivian general, Campero, is at the head of a small army, and
                            threatens to invade Tarapacá, but I assure your excellency, with an
                            assurance based upon many and incontestable reasons, that that threat
                            cannot possibly be realized. There is not the remotest fear that a drop
                            of blood will be shed on that side.</p>

                            <p>The following communication has been addressed by the North American
                                minister to the notables of Lima:</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen</hi>: At your request I make the
                                following declarations: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The United States of America are strongly in favor of the
                                        cessation of hostilities between Chili and Peru, and the
                                        speedy restoration of peace.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>They are decidedly opposed to any dismemberment of the
                                        territory of Peru, except with the free and full consent of
                                        this nation.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>They are of the opinion that Chili, as the result of the
                                        war, has acquired the right of indemnification for the
                                        expenses of the war, and that Peru cannot refuse its
                                        payment.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The Government of Chili knows that these are the views of the United
                                States, but the divisions which exist in Peru paralyze the good
                                effects (offices?) of the United States and afford a pretext to
                                Chili for eluding action by the latter in conformity with our
                                desires, and for prolonging the state of war and the military
                                occupation of Peru. Chili says: “We also desire peace, but there is
                                here no one competent to treat to that end.” This statement is
                                unfortunately true. For such a condition of affairs, the only remedy
                                is to be found in Peru itself. Union under whomsoever may be chosen
                                will dispel the pretext of Chili, and will give to the United States
                                an advantage which they need, and of which they will be able to take
                                advantage. Nothing else, in my judgment, will save Peru from
                                indefinite military occupation by Chili. Peru must herself effect
                                her own salvation through the sacrifice of personal conditions
                                (ambitions?) on the altar of the country’s redemption.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I continue the agreeable task of
                            communicating to you the news brought by the last mail.</p>
                        <p>The rumor current after the arrival of the last mail, to the effect that
                            the municipal authorities had been discharged from their duties in Lima,
                            has proved correct. The general-in-chief of the Chilian army felt
                            himself obliged to take this measure because the municipality wished to
                            act with absolute independence of the executive authority, which was in
                            every way impossible, and also because the management of the municipal
                            funds was in every way improper. On the other hand, the municipality
                            failed to make the necessary expenses for the police, and security and
                            cleanliness of the city, notwithstanding the fact that they had more
                            than sufficient resources for it.</p>
                        <p>These circumstances induced the general-in-chief of the army of
                            occupation to name a superintendent of the municipality; and since the
                            mayor (alcalde) refused to recognize the measure, the rear-admiral was
                            forced to issue a decree with the date of 7th of December, declaring
                            that the functions of the municipality had ceased, and that Señor Adolfo
                            Guerrero was nominated as political chief of the department of Lima.</p>
                        <p>This measure was indispensable, and, for considerations which had no
                            right to exist, had not been taken beforehand because it was impossible
                            to maintain a system whose political and local administration obeyed
                            principles, interests, and regulations completely independent and
                            opposite.</p>
                        <p>At present there are in Peru four supreme chiefs: General Montero in the
                            north; General Cáceres in the center; Colonel Latorre in Arequipa, Puno,
                            and Cuzco; and another, Colonel Pacheco Cespedes, in Moquegna, none of
                            whom recognizes the other as superior.</p>
                        <p>A manuscript of a letter said to have been sent by General Hurlbut to the
                            guerrilla chief Cáceres has been very widely circulated in Lima. In Lima
                            the authenticity of this document was not doubted, and Mr. Hurlbut took
                            no steps to deny it. Your excellency will permit me to inclose a copy of
                            this strange document, which has been published in the press of Panama.
                            I received a manuscript copy, with the assurance that it was
                            authentic.</p>

                                answer your letter by the same person who brought it to me.</p>
                            <p>The United States have already recognized the constitutional
                                government, first in the person of Dr. Don Francisco Garcia
                                Calderon, and afterwards in that of the Vice-President, Rear Admiral
                                Montero.</p>
                            <p>It is, consequently, evident that it is impossible for it to
                                recognize any other government.</p>
                            <p>The plan of a junta appears to me to be altogether impracticable in
                                fact and inadmissible, in theory. A government under this form
                                would, in my judgment, only <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0187"
                                />lead to disagreement and discord, and instead of assuring unity of
                                action, would involve uncertainties and hesitations.</p>
                            <p>I am anxious to see the speediest disappearance of all parties, and
                                that all Peruvians may be united for the maintenance of a
                                constitutional <hi rend="italic">régime</hi>. This would demand
                                sacrifices on the part of some, but all good causes are strengthened
                                precisely in this way—by sacrifices.</p>
                            <p>Within ten days or two weeks there will reach this city special
                                commissioners sent out by the United States. It is of the highest
                                importance to say to them that all Peru is at last united in the
                                sole aim of saving the country.</p>
                            <p>I see no other way by which you can add additional luster to your
                                high reputation, nor by which you can render such good service to
                                the cause of the independence of Peru.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Shortly after closing my dispatch, No. 21, in
                        the matter of the Danish Telegraph Company’s monopoly scheme, I learned that
                        the agent of the company had renewed his efforts at Tientsin to secure the
                        final approval of his propositions by the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>It therefore seemed desirable to lay before the foreign office your views
                        upon this subject as contained in your instructions Nos. 122 and 125, both
                        in order that this government might know that Mr. Angell’s course in the
                        premises had been approved by the Department, and also with the hope that
                        your opinions might have weight in deciding the course of the Chinese
                        Government in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly I addressed a dispatch to Prince Kung, a copy of which is
                        inclosed. In it, after summarizing the contents of your instructions
                        referred to above, I asked His Imperial Highness to inform me <hi
                            rend="italic">officially</hi> whether His Imperial Majesty had approved
                        the agreement made between the agent of the Danish company and Viceroy
                        Li.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I inclose a translation of His Imperial Highnesses reply. It is <hi
                            rend="italic">official</hi>, bearing the seal of the foreign office, and
                        far more satisfactory than I had reason to expect. And it declares
                        positively that the monopoly scheme has not been approved by this
                        government.</p>
                    <p>But by far the most interesting and valuable part of His Imperial Highness’s
                        reply is found in the second paragraph which declares that whenever an
                        American company shall desire to lay a telegraph cable between Japan and
                        China an arrangement will be made “which shall not disappoint the hopes of
                        the American company in the least degree.” In view of the intense and
                        traditional conservatism of China upon this and all kindred questions, the
                        importance of this concession can hardly be overestimated.</p>
                    <p>Having received such satisfactory assurances from the foreign office, I
                        closed the correspondence by thanking Prince Kung for the prompt and
                        explicit answer which he had given.</p>
                    <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0188"/>
                    <p>As the German minister had acted in conjunction with this legation in this
                        business, I have furnished him with a copy of Prince Kung’s letter.</p>
                    <p>I beg your approval of my action in the premises.</p>

                            correspondence which has passed between the foreign office and Mr.
                            Angell, late United States minister, upon the agreement entered into
                            between His Excellency Li and the Great Northern Telegraph Company,
                            under the terms of which the Government of China agrees that, “within a
                            period of twenty years from date not to allow any other person to land
                            telegraph cables in the entire empire, including all foreign settlements
                            and Formosa,” it becomes my duty to inform Your Imperial Highness that
                            Mr. Angell forwarded copies of this correspondence to our government,
                            and that I am now in receipt of instructions in response. The Government
                            of the United States has approved the entire course of the late minister
                            in this business. It has further authorized me to say that such a
                            monopoly would be not only prejudicial to its interests, but also
                            contrary to its idea of the true interests of China, as the granting of
                            monopolies of any kind is not conducive to public good.</p>
                        <p>I shall be glad to be informed, officially, whether His Imperial Majesty
                            has or has not approved and confirmed the agreement referred to.</p>

                                <p>I have had the honor to receive your dispatch of the 8th instant
                                    referring to the establishment of telegraph lines in China;
                                    remarking that you were in receipt of the views of your
                                    government upon the subject, which you were authorized to give
                                    to me; and requesting to be officially informed whether His
                                    Imperial Majesty has or has not approved and confirmed the
                                    agreement entered into between His Excellency Li and the
                                    GreatNorthern Telegraph Company.</p>
                                <p>This office has discussed this business in all its bearings with
                                    Minister Angell, a discussion with which you are doubtless
                                    familiar.</p>
                                <p>If hereafter the United States desire to lay a telegraph cable
                                    from Japan to China, a satisfactory and suitable arrangement
                                    will be made, and one which shall not disappoint the hopes of
                                    the American company in the least degree.</p>
                                <p>As to the propositions heretofore made by the Great Northern
                                    Telegraph Company, they were submitted by the Company to His
                                    Excellency Li, and approved by him; but they have not been laid
                                    before His Imperial Majesty.</p>
                                <p>His Excellency Li, in dealing with this question certainly ought
                                    not rashly to enter into any arrangement which would not
                                    conserve the interest of the government and people of China.</p>

                        September 14, which gave the history of the negotiations between the
                        diplomatic body and the foreign office upon the subject of “transit passes
                        outward” for some months prior to June 20, I have now the honor to inclose
                        several papers which have passed between the Chinese and Mr. von Brandt, and
                        which serve to bring the discussion down to the present time.</p>
                    <p>These papers will serve to show you that no progress has been made in these
                        negotiations since Mr. Angell wrote. It is unnecessary, therefore, for me to
                        do more than to refer you to his dispatch, and to remark that my inclosures
                        form a continuation of the discussion upon two points: 1st, whether
                        foreigners have a right to engage in manufacturing enterprises at the ports;
                        and 2d, as to the dues and duties properly leviable upon native produce

                            native produce purchased by foreign merchants, the proper course would
                            be to follow the treaties already in force. The dispatch also contained
                            a categorical restatement of the points relating to the trade in native

                        <p>With regard to your excellency’s assertion that native produce purchased
                            by foreign merchants at the ports may be used for manufacturing
                            purposes, or that it may be resold at the port, in its original or
                            manufactured state, we have to reply that no explicit statement to this
                            effect is contained in any of the treaties or regulations for trade;
                            your excellency says, in respect to this that there is no reason why the
                            treaties and regulations need not be followed; but we do not know which
                            treaty or regulation it is that you say ought to be followed. The
                            purchase of native produce by foreign merchants, if not exported, but if
                            used for manufacturing purposes, or resold at the port, would be
                            equivalent to allowing foreigners to do the same trade as Chinese
                            merchants, and would be prejudicial to the business of the latter.
                            Moreover, if the goods are not exported, the duty to which they are
                            liable will be lost to the imperial exchequer. In view of this loss to
                            the revenue, and prejudice to the interests of Chinese merchants, it is
                            the duty of the local authorities, in observance of the treaties, and
                            according to circumstances, to decide upon methods of procedure that
                            will meet the necessities of the situation. And it is further desirable
                            that this office should consult with your excellency and the
                            representatives of the other treaty powers with a view to reaching some
                            satisfactory mode of procedure.</p>
                        <p>In the draft presented to us by your excellency, you presented two
                            propositions which you suggested should be put in operation as a trial;
                            but as it is not clearly stated in any of the treaties and regulations
                            that native produce purchased at a port may be used for manufacturing
                            purposes, or resold at the port, we proposed to discuss <pb n="118"
                                xml:id="pg_118" facs="0190"/>with you another method of procedure
                            which had suggested itself to us; but your excellency insisted that our
                            proposition was in contravention of the letter and spirit of the plain
                            language of the treaty, and widely divergent from the practice which had
                            been followed for the last twenty years. We are puzzled to know how this
                            can be.</p>
                        <p>If it were clearly stipulated in the treaties of the different powers
                            that native produce purchased by foreigners at a port may be used for
                            manufacturing purposes or resold at the port, one naturally thinks that
                            the practice must already have been in operation ever since commercial
                            relations have existed at the open ports. Where is the necessity for
                            stipulating clearly at this time that it be introduced as an experiment?
                            And why the necessity for stating clearly that if either of the parties
                            sees any objections to it (he will be at liberty to denounce it)?</p>
                        <p>In our many consultations with your excellency, on this subject of
                            regulations for the trade in native produce, we have not failed to be
                            actuated by sincere motives in our consideration of the subject, always
                            hoping that benefit might result to all parties. Hoping that your
                            excellency will consider this subject with an unimpassioned mind.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your imperial highness and
                            your excellency’s note of July 19, referring to transit-passes outwards
                            and trade in native produce in general, which questious have for some
                            time past formed the subject of my negotiations with the Tsung-li
                            Yamên.</p>
                        <p>I have placed this note, as well as the proposals handed to me by some of
                            the ministers at the conference held at the Yamên on July 10, before my
                            colleagues, the representatives of the other treaty powers, and I have
                            been authorized by them to make the following statement to your imperial
                            highness and your excellencies.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues and myself are of opinion that the text of the treaties
                            give to foreigners full liberty to transact every kind of commercial
                            business at the open ports, subject only to such conditions and
                            restrictions as contained in the treaties themselves, or in the rules
                            and regulations agreed upon conjointly since the conclusion of the
                            treaties.</p>
                        <p>Your imperial highness and your excellencies say in your note of July 10,
                            that such liberty of trade does not exist, because it is nowhere stated
                            in the treaties that goods bought at the port might be sold there or
                            used for manufacturing purposes. But besides that, where permission to
                            trade is granted, such permission must be considered as a general one
                            unless special restrictions are added to it. The rule that native
                            produce carried from the interior to a port may be exempted by payment
                            of the half duty from all inland charges <hi rend="italic">only if bona
                                fide intended for shipment to a foreign port</hi> (Chefoo convention
                            of 1876, section III, Art. IV) is in itself sufficient proof that no
                            such obligation to export to a foreign port exists for native produce
                            having paid all inland charges, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, having
                            been brought from the interior under payment of them, or having been
                            bought at the port.</p>
                        <p>The foreign merchant has further not only the right freely to dispose of
                            native produce to foreigners and Chinese alike at the port unless the
                            produce be brought there under transit pass; but he is also entitled to
                            forward it for sale coastwise (see Regulations of October 30, 1861, III,
                            [Mayers, p. 204]) or inland (same Regulations, I, 3), provided he pays
                            in the first instance export duty and coast-trade duty, and in the
                            second one all charges imposed on goods <hi rend="italic">in
                                transitu</hi> by the provincial governments.</p>
                        <p>With regard to native produce being used for manufacturing purposes the
                            French treaty of 1858, Art. VII, the German treaty of 1861, Art. VI, the
                            Belgian treaty of 1869, Art. XI, and the Austro-Hungarian treaty of
                            1869, Art. VIII, give to the subjects of these powers the right to
                            exercise at the open ports any industry they like, no restriction being
                            attached to this concession, neither with regard to the materials to be
                            used, nor to the disposal of the goods so manufactured.</p>
                        <p>These are the views held by my colleagues and myself with regard to the
                            trade in native produce, and which we must maintain to express the
                            principles laid down by the treaties and acted upon until lately, when
                            illegal attempts have been made by the Chinese authorities at some of
                            the open ports to put them aside. Under these circumstances my
                            colleagues and myself, while willing and anxious to unite with the
                            Tsung-li Yamên in the discussion and execution of any measures which may
                            be deemed necessary for the protection of the Chinese revenue, or the
                            better and more satisfactory execution of treaty stipulations, do not
                            feel at liberty to enter upon a discussion of those rules and
                            regulations laid down in the treaties which are rightly considered as
                            the basis of the relations between China and foreign powers, and which
                            they have <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0191"/>neither the will nor
                            the power to alter or to apply in any other way than explained in this
                            note.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, two points in your imperial highness and your
                            excellencies’ note of July 19, which my colleagues and myself do not
                            wish to pass under silence, as by doing so your imperial highness and
                            your excellencies might suppose that we agreed with the views expressed
                            in them by the Tsung-li Yamên. The one is the statement that if the
                            right freely to trade in native produce at the port or to subject it to
                            a manufacturing process was contained in the treaties, it would not be
                            necessary to introduce it now as an experiment, or to state expressly in
                            the arrangement under discussion that either of the contracting parties
                            should be at liberty to denounce it; the other, the opinion put forward
                            in the note in question, that it was the duty of the local authorities
                            in certain cases referring to the execution of the treaties to act
                            according to their own views and to the necessities of the case.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the first point it will be sufficient to draw your
                            imperial highness and your excellencies’ attention to the declaration
                            made by me in my note of November 26, 1880, as well as on other
                            occasions, that the rules contained in sections II and III, and
                            referring more especially to duty-free goods and goods manufactured from
                            native produce were nothing but a reassertion of treaty rights rendered
                            necessary by the persistent efforts of local authorities to ignore them.
                            The denunciation of the arrangement under discussion by one of the
                            contracting parties would therefore have rendered inefficient not those
                            treaty rights, but only such new stipulations as had been embodied in
                            the same arrangement.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the second point, the independent interpretation of the
                            treaties by the local authorities, your imperial highness and your
                            excellencies will remember that it has been at the express and urgent
                            demand of the Chinese Government that the discussion and settlement of
                            difficulties arising under the treaties has been transferred from the
                            local authorities to the central government and foreign representatives
                            at Peking. Under these circumstances my colleagues and myself have the
                            right to expect that it shall not further be left to the local Chinese
                            authorities to substitute their own individual views for those of the
                            central government, and thereby provoke discussions and conflicts not
                            unlikely seriously to endanger the good relations between China and the
                            treaty powers. My colleagues and myself must insist that in future in
                            all cases referring to the execution of the treaties the provincial
                            authorities shall not any more act upon their own views and
                            responsibility, but upon and under the instructions of the central
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Having thus laid before your imperial highness and your excellencies the
                            views of my colleagues and myself on the question of trade in native
                            produce, I have the honor to add that your imperial highness and your
                            excellencies, in your note of July 19, have expressed the desire to see
                            the negotiations continued. I shall be most happy to resume the <hi

                            provided they are carried on with the view of removing the Yamên’s
                            complaints as to the illegal use of transit passes outwards, and’ those
                            of my colleagues and myself with regard to the illegal attempts of local
                            authorities to ignore the stipulations of the treaties referring to the
                            treatment of duty-free foreign imports and native produce and the use or
                            exportation of goods bought or manufactured in the port.</p>

                        <p>On the 19th of September we had the honor to receive your excellency’s
                            dispatch of September 18, by which you informed us that you had
                            submitted our dispatch (of the 19th July) and our proposals (of the 10th
                            July) regarding the treatment of native produce, which for some time
                            past had formed the subject of deliberation between your excellency and

                            powers.</p>
                        <p>What your excellency says in this dispatch, viz, that according to all
                            the treaties foreign merchants have the right to engage in <hi
                                rend="italic">any</hi> kind of trade at the open ports, is, however,
                            only a one-sided hypothetical argument. The tenor and meaning of the
                            treaties and special regulations is quite clear and distinct, and it
                            does not therefore seem to be allowable that by problematical assertions
                            of this kind the danger of manifold misunderstandings should be
                            created.</p>
                        <p>You further state that the freedom of trade is subject to such conditions
                            and restrictions only as are explicitly contained in the treaties or in
                            some special regulations. If, then, <hi rend="italic">restrictions</hi>
                            of trade, in order to be binding, must be explicitly stipulated, how,
                            then, in the reversed case, could it be lawful to claim <hi
                                rend="italic">liberties</hi> of trade summarily and as a matter of
                            course even without their having been explicitly stipulated? The <pb
                                n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0192"/>matter lies rather thus: That
                            neither liberties nor restrictions of trade, inasmuch as they have not
                            been explicitly stated in the treaties, can be simply and positively
                            claimed by way of inference, by the one or the other party, on the
                            ground of one-sided opinions. Far from this. It is rather necessary that
                            an agreement should be arrived at on the ground of mutual deliberations
                            before it is permitted to act accordingly.</p>
                        <p>If, as your excellency holds, the simple <hi rend="italic"
                                >non-existence</hi> of a stipulation in the treaties and special
                            regulations, by which some branch of trade is forbidden, were sufficient
                            in order to infer therefrom that merchants are at liberty to engage in
                            it—in this case anything not mentioned in the treaties and special
                            regulations (and there are a great many such things) would just on this
                            account be permitted; yet what would the foreign powers say were China
                            to take up such a position in her relations with them?</p>
                        <p>If in Section III, Article IV, of the Chefoo convention it is said that
                            if foreign merchants pay the half duty and take out a transit
                            certificate for this purpose they may then transport the goods to the
                            port, but that this privilege <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be claimed
                            if the native produce in question is not the property of a British
                            merchant, or if it is not really intended for conveyance to a port, this
                            means only that none but native produce purchased by foreign merchants
                            for exportation to foreign countries enjoys the privilege of the transit
                            certificate and of the payment of the half duty; whereas when this is
                            not the case such produce is subject to the regulations existing for the
                            interior of China; but it follows by no means therefrom that native
                            produce purchased at the port for which no transit certificate has been
                            taken out need not be exported.</p>
                        <p>The third section and the third paragraph of the first section of the (in
                            Chinese so-called) “General Regulations” (of October 30,1861) further
                            relate to the treatment at the custom-house of merchandise which has
                            arrived from another port, of a manufacturing process, and of a sale of
                            goods which have not been exported at the port of purchase the “General
                            Regulations” do not say anything expressly at all, and it is therefore
                            not admissible to ascribe such a meaning to them.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency further appeals to Art. VII of the French, Art. VI of the
                            German, Art. XI of the Belgian, and Art. VIII of the Austrian and
                            Hungarian treaties in order to prove that subjects of the above-named
                            countries are “at liberty to engage in industrial enterprises at the
                            open ports;” but this expression relates merely to the execution of
                            sundry labors in general, and means that Chinese and foreigners are
                            permitted to engage themselves as laborers and workmen, and work; but
                            with the manufacturing of goods it has nothing to do, nor does it
                            signify that goods so manufactured may be sold as a matter of course.
                            Each treaty stipulation, in fact, has its own individual meaning, and
                            the different meanings must not be intermixed with each other.</p>
                        <p>The treaty stipulations convened with different countries must, of
                            course, on both sides, be conscientiously adhered to, and if, in the
                            proposals under consideration, it is said with regard to native produce
                            bought at the port that they shall be put into force <hi rend="italic"
                                >provisionally</hi> the reason thereof simply is because the
                            treaties say nothing with regard to this point; that, on the other hand,
                            the local authorities have the right in certain cases to adopt measures
                            according to their own judgment. This is expressly stipulated in the
                            treaties concluded with different countries, and is a point which ought
                            always to be adhered to. So, for instance, with regard to the
                            regulations now in course of deliberation in reference to duty-free
                            goods and to the manufacturing of native produce, it must, of necessity,
                            be stipulated that, if the one party should wish it so, the new
                            agreement shall again be cancelled; for the authority of convening
                            treaty regulations rests in the hands of our Yamên and of the
                            representatives of the treaty powers; but whether something is
                            advantageous or injurious can only be determined after the local
                            authorities have put it during some time into practice.</p>
                        <p>As regards the treatment of native produce, we do desire as soon as
                            possible to come to an understanding with your excellency and to put the
                            new rules into force, but only under the condition that both parties
                            should profit thereby, in order that what once has been stipulated
                            should also remain in force for a long time.</p>

                        <p>At the end of last month we were able to give our readers the
                            intelligence that at length the Woosung Bar is to be eradicated. A
                            contract was signed on 27th December by the Taotai Liu on behalf of the
                            Chinese Government on the one side, and Mr. W. Watson, of Messrs.
                            Maclean &amp; Co., on the other, for the importation of a dredging
                            machine to be used specially for the removal of the “heaven sent
                            barrier.” Thus, after ten years’ continuous exertion on the part of the
                            weightiest and wealthiest circle of the community, backed by the Chamber
                            of Commerce, and aided by the influence of China merchants in England,
                            that which these combined agencies have failed to achieve has been
                            accomplished by an individual firm. It is a significant fact that the
                            China of to-day is a country which at last has awakened from its long
                            repose in Sleepy Hollow, and is fully aroused to the necessity of
                            keeping pace with the giant strides of the West. In olden days the
                            Woosung bar was regarded by Prince Kung and the official celestials
                            generally as an omnipotent barrier to the Western barbarian. By them it
                            was looked upon as a fragment of the great wall of China sunk in the
                            mouth of the Whangpo. As the great wall was thought to be a most perfect
                            means of excluding the outer barbarians from entering on the domains of
                            the Son of Heaven, so this bar was looked upon as a most effective
                            protection against foreign war-ships attempting to come up to Shanghai.
                            It was this feeling that caused the Chinese officials to offer that
                            impalpable but persistent opposition to any preliminary measures
                            proposed to abolish this obstacle that has, until lately, characterized
                            the celestial nation in dealing with the foreigner. As we have stated,
                            the determined outcry of the foreigners, and their customary energy in
                            endeavoring to remove this bar, dates from some ten years back. In olden
                            days when the vessels visiting this port were nearly all sailing ships,
                            those of deep draught were content to wait for days at the bar for
                            water. Those were the “good old times” when there was only a monthly
                            mail delivered by the P. and O. in steamers no bigger than the present
                            Tientsin packets, when Shanghai made pleasure a business and business a
                            pleasure, when there was none of the hurry-scurry worry, and fight for
                            existence which characterises the settlement of to-day. But now,
                            immediately ships arrive at Woosung, it is imperative that they should
                            force a way over the bar, and come into port with all possible speed. To
                            assist them in doing this a swarm of cargo-boats have cropped up on the
                            river, and they are always in readiness to hurry to the bar, and lighter
                            ships of deep draught sufficiently to enable them more easily to force
                            their keels through the mud of the bar.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of this, the leading merchants, and notably the Chamber of
                            Commerce, brought their weight and energy to bear on the Chinese with a
                            view to the removal of the obstruction. Thus at great expense, and with
                            considerable perseverance in this direction, Messrs. Escher and De Ryke
                            were instructed to survey the river and report upon the cheapest and
                            most efficient method by which a clear channel could be maintained. The
                            exhaustive and elaborate reports of these gentlemen will be sufficiently
                            fresh in the recollection of our readers to dispense with
                            recapitulation. But able and practical as were the suggestions of these
                            experts, and backed as they were by the influence of the Chamber of
                            Commerce, they were never practically recognized by the Chinese
                            authorities. Nor did Major Bridgford’s report achieve any greater
                            success, although the method which he advocated for clearing the river
                            was estimated to cost no more than Tls.150,000. We may here remark that,
                            at the period when the name of the Heaven-sent barrier was given to this
                            bar, if the foreign merchants had agreed to remove the obstruction at
                            their own expense, it is more than questionable if the Chinese
                            authorities would have permitted such an action, judging from the spirit
                            in which they regarded this impediment to the navigation of <pb n="122"
                                xml:id="pg_122" facs="0194"/>the Whangpoo. Comparing the opinions
                            held by the Chinese on this matter some ten years since with those which
                            have been just recently expressed by them in their latest action, we are
                            struck with the advance the “black-headed people” have made in regard to
                            emerging from a strict and bigoted conservatism into a liberal and
                            progressive mode of thinking and acting.</p>
                        <p>The contract just signed is a significant fact of China’s
                            progressiveness, and forms a conclusive answer to those who are ringing
                            eternal changes on the antiquated opinions formed of the conservatism of
                            the nation. In respect to the method to be employed in removing the bar
                            under the contract recently signed, we know but little, except that a
                            dredger vessel is being built by Messrs. William Simon’s &amp; Co., of
                            London Works, Renfrew, Scotland. It will be schooner-rigged, with twin
                            screws, and of 80-horse power, nominal. It will be what is designated
                            the “patent hopper dredger,” and will carry 600 tons of mud at an
                            average speed of seven miles per hour, lifted from the bottom to a
                            maximum of 30 feet, at the rate of 300 tons per hour.</p>
                        <p>As to whether this dredger is to be employed directly upon the bar, or
                            what is known as the false channel of the Whangpoo, we are not in a
                            position to say. But from the several reports upon the best methods of
                            clearing the river which we have seen, most of the experts concur in
                            advocating the “development” of the north or junk channel. The advantage
                            of this method of procedure has been ably explained and advocated in
                            Major Bridgford’s report. In this he states: “When man attempts to
                            meddle with nature he can only succeed in permanently modifying its
                            aspects by studying the constant laws of its phenomena and by making his
                            works conformable to these.” And in following out this axiom Major
                            Bridgford points out that if by any reasonable means the whole volume of
                            the river could be diverted into one channel instead of as at present
                            being divided by Gough’s Island into two, the false bars would cease to
                            exist. Thus the junk channel would be made the true and deep course of
                            the river, and the ship channel would silt up entirely. To accomplish
                            this the major points out that the first object to be attained is the
                            enlargement of the sectional area of the most shoal portion of the junk
                            channel, as by having an enlarged area a much greater volume of
                            flood-tide water will be projected past Gough’s Island, and sp stored
                            for supplying the ebb with increased volume. As this enlargement
                            progresses the strength of the ebb will at first increase in the ship’s
                            channel owing to the increased volume of water received through the junk
                            channel; and will also from the same cause (plus the enlargement of the
                            channel) increase the ebb in the junk channel.</p>
                        <p>By this method it is shown that gradually the volume discharged by the
                            junk channel would exceed that discharged by the ship channel to such an
                            extent that the false bar or lip at its lower end would commence to silt
                            up, thus increasing the choke to the ebb in that channel. The principal
                            advantages claimed by Major Bridgford for this method of attack are
                            summarized as follows: First, that the navigation will not be impeded
                            during the progress of the works; second, it will give more rise of tide
                            up the river; third, the restoring of that section of the river to one
                            channel, navigable at all times of tide, instead of at present having
                            two channels that are only navigable at certain times of tide.</p>
                        <p>As we have already stated, we are in ignorance as to whether the dredger
                            which is to arrive in Shanghai within nine months from the present time
                            will work upon the system advocated by the above report. But experts in
                            this matter are of opinion that instead of using steam hoppers and
                            carrying mud out to sea, it might be cheaper to discharge it on the
                            banks where it could be utilized. This could easily be accomplished by
                            what is known as an “overhead traveller,” or if it were discovered that
                            sand had accumulated in the bed of the channel, it could speedily be
                            conveyed ashore by a “flume,” similar to those used with such signal
                            success in the Suez Canal. But by whatever means the new dredger is to
                            work, we have all to be thankful that at length the barrier is to be
                            abolished, and that at the end of the present year we can exclaim, “Away
                            with it.”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 54, in regard to
                        the dredging of the Woosung bar, I have the honor to inform you that I
                        mentioned the matter to the ministers of the foreign office to-day. They
                        requested <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0195"/>me, informally,.to say to
                        the Department that the scheme as given in the newspaper extract is correct;
                        that work is to be begun within the current year; that the water on the bar
                        is to be deepened by about ten feet (which will give, I believe, an average
                        depth of about 26 feet at high water), and that the entire expense is to be
                        borne by the Chinese Government, no tax for it being laid upon the commerce
                        of Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>I thanked the ministers for this information, and congratulated them on
                        behalf of the Government of the United States upon their decision to
                        undertake this much needed improvement.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward herewith for the
                        information of the Department a copy of an order in counsel issued by the
                        Govenrment of Great Britain, dated October 25, 1881, as published in China
                        under the authority of Sir Thomas Wade, the British minister.</p>
                    <p>While there is much in this order in council which cannot fail to be of
                        interest to the Department, I beg leave, at the moment, to call your
                        attention to that portion of it, numbers 6 to 20, inclusive, which
                        authorizes Her Majesty’s minister in China to make regulations “for the
                        peace, order, and good government of British subjects resident in or
                        resorting to China.”</p>
                    <p>The Department is well aware that at all of the open ports in China
                        settlements of foreigners have grown up who are exclusively subject to the
                        jurisdiction of their own authorities, and who directly or representatively
                        control the immense and growing commerce between China and foreign
                        countries. These settlements are invariably cosmopolitan in their character,
                        containing representatives of nearly every known nationality and subjects of
                        every type of human government. It has been manifestly necessary to devise
                        some system under which the heterogeneous population could be governed, and
                        due protection assured to the lives and property concerned.</p>
                    <p>This has been done by the establishment of <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi>
                        municipal organizations at the various ports to which have been delegated
                        the powers ordinarily given to similar organizations at home, subject to the
                        approval and general control of the consular and diplomatic representatives
                        interested.</p>
                    <p>The authority thus given, and under which taxes have been levied, suitable
                        police regulations maintained, roads and streets been built and kept in
                        order, and the health, convenience, and good order of the settlements
                        generally conserved, has almost invariably been exercised with great
                        discretion and good judgment, and has rarely been called in question.</p>
                    <p>Cases have, however, arisen in which the legality of this entire system has
                        been disputed. Notably at Shanghai in the spring of 1881, Mr. Frank Reid, an
                        American citizen, refused to pay a tax levied by the municipal council, upon
                        the ground that Congress alone could impose such <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124"
                            facs="0196"/>an obligation upon him, and that the United States minister
                        had no power to make him in any way liable to the demands of such a body as
                        the municipal council of Shanghai. The tax was recovered from Mr. Ried
                        through a suit brought before our consul-general, and by an execution levied
                        on Mr. Reid’s property. I inclose a copy of Mr. Denny’s decision.</p>
                    <p>Although the case ended in the manner described above, there is grave reason
                        to fear that, could the defendant have taken an appeal to a circuit court of
                        the United States, the decision of such higher court must have been rendered
                        in his favor. And this in turn would have been followed by the downfall of
                        the municipal governments at every port in China, through the refusal of the
                        residents to pay the taxes by means of which such governments can be
                        supported.</p>
                    <p>There is in my opinion little room to doubt that, owing to the lack of
                        appropriate legislation, many things have in the past been done by the
                        officers of our government here which have been really <hi rend="italic"
                            >extra legal</hi>, so to speak, that is to say not founded on any plain
                        well-defined statute. It is in the highest degree important that acts of
                        this sort should cease. And it is, on the other hand, vitally important, in
                        view of the large and rapidly increasing population and property interests
                        in these foreign settlements in China, that ample power, clearly defined and
                        carefully guarded, should be vested in the proper department of our
                        government to make and enforce suitable regulations, either singly or in
                        concert with other powers, for the control and government of American
                        citizens resident in China.</p>
                    <p>I beg, therefore, to call your earnest attention to this subject, and to
                        suggest, in default of a better plan, whether such Congressional action may
                        not be secured as will give to the representative of the United States in
                        China, subject to the approval of the President, power similar to that
                        conferred upon the British minister in China by the order in council
                        inclosed.</p>
                    <p>There is the more immediate occasion for the consideration of this subject,
                        as the diplomatic body here has now under discussion a new series of
                        municipal regulations for Shanghai which have been submitted to us by our
                        consuls, and which it will be my duty to lay before the Department at an
                        early moment.</p>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>33. Registered bills of sale affecting the same chattels have, as among
                            themselves, priority in order of registration.</p>
                        <p>34. Chattels comprised in a registered bill of sale are not in the
                            possession, order, or disposition of the grantor with the law of
                            bankruptcy.</p>
                        <p>35. If in any case there is an unregistered bill of sale, and within or

                            thereof, a subsequent bill of sale is granted, affecting the same or
                            some of the same chattels, for the same or part of the same debt, then
                            the subsequent bill is, to the extent to which it comprises the same
                            chattels and is for the same debt, absolutely void, unless the supreme
                            court for China and Japan, or the court for Japan, as the case may
                            require, is satisfied that the subsequent bill is granted in good faith
                            for the purpose of correcting some material error in the prior bill, and
                            not for the purpose of unlawfully evading the operation of this
                            order.</p>
                        <p>36. The registration of a bill of sale must be renewed once at least
                            every five years.</p>
                        <p>37. Renewal of registration is made as follows: An affidavit stating the
                            date of and parties to the bill of sale, and the date of the original
                            registration, and of the last renewal, and that the bill is still a
                            subsisting security, is brought into the proper office of the court or
                            consulate of the original registration, and is left there.</p>
                        <p>38. If the registration of a bill of sale is not so renewed in any period
                            of five years, then on and from the expiration of that period the bill
                            is deemed to be unregistered.</p>
                        <p>39. The provisions of this order relating to renewal apply to bills of
                            sale registered under the regulations repealed by this order.</p>
                        <p>40. A transfer or assignment of a registered bill of sale need not be
                            registered; and renewal of registration is not necessary by reason only
                            of such a transfer or assignment.</p>
                        <p>41. Where the time for registration or renewal of registration of a bill
                            of sale expires on a Sunday, or other day on which the office for
                            registration is closed, the registration or renewal is valid if made on
                            the first subsequent day on which the office is open.</p>
                        <p>42. If in any case the supreme court for China and Japan, or the court
                            for Japan, as the case may require, is satisfied that failure to
                            register or to renew the registration of a bill of sale in due time, or
                            any omission or misstatement connected with registration or renewal, was
                            accidental or inadvertent, the court may, if it thinks fit, order the
                            failure, omission, or misstatement to be rectified in such manner and on
                            such terms, if any, respecting security, notice by advertisement or
                            otherwise, or any other matter, as the court thinks fit.</p>
                        <p>43.—(<hi rend="italic">a.</hi>) The provisions of this order, except as
                            regards renewal of registration, do not apply to a bill of sale executed
                            before the commencement of this order.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b.</hi>) As regards a bill of sale executed before the
                            commencement of this order, the regulations repealed by this order
                            shall, notwithstanding that repeal, be in force, and shall be deemed to
                            have always been of the like validity and effect as if they had
                            originally been made by order in council.</p>
                        <p>44. The power conferred on the chief justice of the supreme court for
                            China and Japan by article 127 of the China and Japan order in council,
                            1865, of framing rules from time to time, is hereby extended to the
                            framing of rules for prescribing and regulating the making and keeping
                            of indexes, and of a general index, to the registers of bills of sale,
                            and searches in those indexes, and other particulars connected with the
                            making, keeping, and using of those registers and indexes, and for
                            authorizing and regulating the unregistering of any bill of sale, or the

                            subjects, jointly, and in another suit one of them is plaintiff, and the

                            costs, unless the court so directs; but the co-plaintiff British subject
                            is responsible for all fees and costs.</p>

                            any other liability, guilty of an offense against this order, and for
                            every such offense, on conviction thereof, by summary trial, is liable

                            morning as follows:</p>
                        <p>The municipal council for the foreign community of Shanghai north of the
                            Yang-king-pang, by their secretary bring suit against Frank Reid, a
                            citizen of the United States to recover 10 taels and 72 cents as taxes
                            alleged to be due from the defendant <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131"

                            second quarter of this year. While the defendant denies the material
                            allegations of the complaint, yet from the evidence adduced upon the
                            trial it appears that these taxes were charged against him in the usual
                            way, and in accordance with the land regulations which have hitherto
                            governed in such cases, and that payment has been requested by
                            plaintiffs and refused. The defendant denies that the plaintiffs are a
                            legally constituted body and that for this reason he should not be taxed
                            in any way upon their order for municipal purposes or otherwise; that he
                            is a citizen of the United States, and as such only the Congress of his
                            government can constitutionally impose such obligations upon him.</p>
                        <p>Answering the first objection raised, the plaintiffs, by their counsel,
                            rely for the legality of their action upon the land regulations of the
                            settlement, submitted to the foreign ministers at Peking, and by them
                            approved September 24, 1869, and which went into effect the beginning of
                            the following year. The ministers of the treaty powers, approving the
                            regulations referred to, were those of the United States of America,
                            Great Britain, France, Russsia, and the North German Confederation. But
                            the defendant disputes the authority of the United States minister by
                            that act to make him in any way liable to the demands of such a body as
                            the municipal council of Shanghai.</p>
                        <p>The United States minister to China is the superior officer of this
                            consulate-general judicially as well as diplomatically, and whatever the
                            result might be, if the law, bearing upon a suit of this nature Was
                            strictly construed, it is a fact of which the court must take judicial
                            notice that the regulations alluded to were approved by the minister for
                            the United States, acting, as he believed, within the scope of his
                            ministerial authority, and which action has been approved by the
                            executive department of his government. Not only this, but for eleven
                            years the validity of these regulations has been maintained and enforced
                            by this court. This, if there were no other reasons, would cause me to
                            at least hesitate before reversing its decisions in this behalf in any
                            ordinary case now. In the next place the defendant claims too much for
                            his citizenship when he says that only the State of New York, of which
                            he is a resident, and the United States Congress have a right to levy
                            taxes on him; for an interpretation so broad would exempt him from all
                            taxation wherever he may choose to go outside of the United States.
                            Neither does the defendant make that distinction which must be made when
                            considering the rights and duties of a citizen at home, and those rights
                            and duties as a permanent or temporary resident of China. Within the
                            United States he is governed by the laws of the State wherein he
                            resides, and by the general laws of Congress. This is not the case,
                            however, in China, for the laws of a State can have no bearing in
                            protecting his rights here, or redressing his wrongs; while those of
                            Congress are only special in their application. The right to live in,
                            and pursue the various business callings in this empire is secured to
                            citizens of the United States by treaty stipulations, and for the
                            purpose of giving force and effect to those stipulations, Congress, by
                            special act, has established ministerial and consular courts, with both
                            diplomatic and judicial powers, the latter being in some respects
                            extraordinary. Within the United States, a citizen cannot be tried for
                            the commission of a felony unless he has first been indicted by a grand
                            jury regularly drawn. And then he can only be tried upon such indictment
                            by a jury of his peers, while in China he is denied both. So, in cases
                            at law, in the United States, he is entitled to have his civil rights
                            passed upon by a jury. This privilege he is denied here. There, he has
                            the right of appeal. Here this right can only be claimed in certain
                            cases. This distinction is not referred to with the view to questioning
                            the wisdom of it, but simply to show that it does exist. Again, United
                            States vessels visiting the different ports of China are entitled to
                            have the services of pilots to take them safely in and out of port, but
                            there is nothing said in the treaty as to the manner of choosing them or
                            of what nationality they shall be. This, however, has been provided for
                            by the Chinese authorities acting in conjunction with the
                            representatives of the treaty powers; neither is there anything said in
                            the treaty of the United States about a tax as a license fee for being
                            protected in this privilege, yet such a tax is demanded by the Chinese
                            authorities and properly collected from American citizens who are
                            engaged in that business here. It is but a legitimate outgrowth of
                            treaty stipulations with this government. The same may be claimed with
                            greater force for the establishment and maintenance of the municipal
                            government for the foreign settlement of Shanghai. The object sought by
                            foreign governments in concluding treaties with China was to obtain
                            commercial advantages and the importance and value of the advantages
                            resulting there from which have for their center the port of Shanghai,
                            already attest the wisdom of such agreements. So important have these
                            interests become, that at least 2,500 foreigners of different
                            nationalities have been drawn here to stimulate and protect them. The
                            magnitude and nature of these interests and the number of foreigners
                            residing here would render it almost impossible for the residents to
                            enjoy privileges conceded to them by the treaty without the aid of a
                            recognized municipality. For on account of the defects in the natural
                            advantages of the port, residents <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132"
                                facs="0204"/>occupying houses anywhere within the business portion
                            of the settlement would continually suffer loss and great inconvenience,
                            if these defects were not cured by local legislation; and so long as
                            persons choose to reside within these improved boundaries and continue
                            to enjoy the advantages resulting from a local government which seems to
                            be so well administered as this, it is but just that they should pay an
                            equitable proportion of the taxes for such purposes.</p>
                        <p>Judgment for plaintiffs as prayed for with costs.</p>

                        information of the department, a printed translation of a proclamation

                        and valuable, since it not only shows a favorable disposition on the part of
                        the Chinese authorities towards our people, but admits a right which has not
                        been claimed by us under the treaties, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, the
                        right of missionaries to purchase and hold for the use of their work real

                        <p>I inclose herewith translation of a proclamation issued by the magistrate
                            of the Yuen Ho District, Soochow, 31st December, 1881, establishing the
                            right of missionaries under treaty to purchase land and erect buildings
                            in this city for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion. This
                            is the first recognition of our treaty rights that the officials of
                            Soochow have ever given us. You will at once recognize (1) that this
                            indicates a very decided change in public sentiment from what existed in
                            that city only a few years since; and (2) that under the administration
                            of well-disposed magistrates the probabilities of conflict between the
                            people and the missionaries are reduced to a minimum.</p>
                        <p>The Southern Methodist Mission, U. S. A., now have in Soochow property
                            worth some $15,000, comprising— <list>

                                <item>A large lot for hospital, and residence of female medical
                                    missionaries, and girls’ boarding-school, and residence for lady
                                    teachers.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>All of this is situated on the Tien-sz-Chuang in compounds contiguous to
                            one another and constituting a most imposing headquarters to the work of
                            the Southern Methodist Miss on in this city. Besides the above the
                            mission also owns a valuable property elsewhere in the city, which is to
                            be occupied by a chapel, native parsonage, and a day-school. It is to
                            this property the proclamation refers, and it is hoped now that the
                            missionary occupation of this great city has been recognized and that
                            there will not soon occur any event to mar the prospect of future good
                            will and prosperity of the missionary work. To the respective
                            missionaries engaged in the transaction involved in the purchase of the
                            above land and the erection of houses thereon great credit is due for
                            their patience and tact in accomplishing results so satisfactory.</p>

                        <p>This proclamation is issued at the request of C. F. Reid, an American
                            missionary, who states that he has purchased of Messrs. Tsiang and Chang
                            two plots of land situated on Heaven bestowed Market street and on the
                            boundary of the Dzun San and the De San blocks. He also states that the
                            said plots of lauds were purchased with funds contributed by the church
                            and for the purpose of erecting a church and free school-buildings. He
                            also states that the roofs, walls, and doors of said buildings will
                            correspond with those of native houses, and that the buildings will be
                            so located as in nowise to interfere with the homes of the people.</p>
                        <p>But lest rowdies and unprincipled persons should interfere and hinder the
                            work he asks that a record be made of this affair, that the higher
                            officials be notified and that a suitable proclamation be issued in
                            reference to it.</p>
                        <p>This office having been duly notified of the above, and whereas Tsa
                            Voong-tsung, a native, states that the said land was purchased for the
                            erection of said buildings for the common use and to be held as the
                            common property of the Christian church;</p>
                        <p>And whereas Tsiang King-têh and Chang Chên-san, with their middlemen,
                            certify that they have sold the said two plots of land of which they
                            were in possession by inheritance, said land being in fee-simple, to the
                            said Tsa Voong-tsung to be given to the Christian church;</p>
                        <p>And whereas said land is in a retired locality, has been unoccupied since
                            the rebellion, and in no way interferes with the residence of the
                            people;</p>
                        <p>And whereas the minister superintendent of trade and the higher

                            to bear in mind that the renting or purchasing of land by foreign

                            of Christianity, is in accordance with treaty stipulations; and
                            henceforth should any rowdies or unprincipled persons take advantage of
                            any cause to create disturbances in that vicinity, the constable is

                    <p>Article 2 of the treaty with China, proclaimed October 5, 1881, provides as
                        follows, viz:</p>
                    <p>“The Governments of China and of the United States mutually agree and
                        undertake <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0206"/>that Chinese subjects
                        shall not be permitted to import opium into any of the ports of the United
                        States, and citizens of the United States shall not be permitted to import
                        opium into any of the open ports of China, to transport it from one open
                        port to any other open port, or to buy and sell opium in any of the open
                        ports of China. This absolute prohibition, which extends to vessels owned by
                        the citizens or subjects of either power, to foreign vessels employed by
                        them, or to vessels owned by the citizens or subjects of either power and
                        employed by other persons for the transportation of opium, shall be enforced
                        by appropriate legislation on the part of China and the United States; and
                        the benefits of the favored-nation clause in existing treaties shall not be
                        claimed by the citizens or subjects of either power as against the
                        provisions of this article.”</p>
                    <p>The attention of collectors of customs is invited to the article, and they
                        are hereby directed to enforce its provisions.</p>
                    <p>Opium imported into any of the ports of the United States by Chinese subjects
                        will be seized and held for forfeiture. All parties concerned should take
                        notice of the provisions of section 3082, Revised Statutes, to the effect
                        that if any person shall fraudulently or knowingly import or bring into the
                        United States, or assist in so doing, any merchandise contrary to law, or
                        shall receive, conceal, buy, sell, or in any manner facilitate the
                        transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise after importation,
                        knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law, such merchandise
                        shall be forfeited, and the offender shall be fined in any sum not exceeding
                        $5,000 nor less than $50, or be imprisoned for any time not exceeding two
                        years, or both.</p>
                    <p>In the case of such importations of opium already shipped, the Department, on
                        special application, will decide what measures should be taken for the
                        remission of the forfeiture incurred.</p>
                    <p>Officers of the customs will take pains to bring the provisions of this
                        circular to the attention of Chinese subjects who have heretofore been in
                        the habit of importing the article into the United States.</p>

                        27th ultimo, I have now the honor to furnish the Department with copies of
                        further correspondence which has passed between Mr. von Brandt, as the
                        representative of the diplomatic body, and the foreign office, upon the
                        general subject of native produce bought and manufactured at the ports.</p>

                            <item>That foreigners have no right to engage in manufacturing

                            <item>That if they do, goods so manufactured must invariably be

                        </list></p>
                    <p>In the opinion of the entire diplomatic body, there is no treaty stipulation

                                Office, March</hi>, 1882.</head>
                        <p>In the interview which the undersigned, by order of the minister of the
                            German Empire, had with the members of the Yamên, on the 22d of October,
                            1881 (their excellencies Wang-wên-shao, Mao Sin shu, Chung Si, and Sia
                            chia hao being present), the Chinese ministers repeated, with as much
                            emphasis as ever their argument that <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135"
                                facs="0207"/>“foreign merchants are obliged to export all native
                            produce they may have purchased, and that they are not at liberty to
                            dispose of it at the open ports.” Wang-wên-shao expressed this several
                            times in these words, that “there are no native goods but must be
                            exported,” adding that the trade with native produce at the Chinese
                            ports is a branch of commerce reserved to Chinese merchants.</p>
                        <p>In the further course of the conversation Wang-wên-shao granted that at
                            the present moment the question was one of little moment for the Chinese
                            Government. But if for instance, in future, cotton goods were
                            manufactured at the ports from Chinese cotton, and if foreign merchants
                            were permitted to sell such goods at the ports, then, the Chinese
                            Government would lose, either the export duty on the cotton or the
                            import duty on the goods manufactured from it. And if these
                            manufactories were in Chinese hands, also the foreign merchants would be
                            losers, for the foreign article would of course not be able to compete
                            with the article manufactured in China, as the latter one had paid no
                            import duty.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government desiring as little to give to the Chinese
                            merchants an undue advantage over the foreigner as <hi rend="italic"
                                >vice versa</hi>, had therefore already given orders that if the
                            Chinese cotton goods manufactory in Shanghai came into existence, the
                            articles manufactured in it should have to pay an impost, equal to the
                            tariff import duty on foreign cotton goods.</p>
                        <p>Wang-wên-shao therefore proposed that in section III, 2 of the
                            provisional rules no distinction should be made with reference to the
                            period within which native produce is to be exported, between produce
                            procured under transit pass from the interior and produce bought at the
                            port.</p>
                        <p>Failing this, he pretended that all the concession contained in section I
                            of the provisional rules were without value to the Yamên.</p>
                        <p>At a second interview on the 27th of December, 1881, Wang-wên-shao, in
                            the presence, and with the consent of very nearly the same ministers who
                            had been there on the 22d of October, said very briefly that the
                            stand-point of the Yamên with reference to this question was still the
                            same as heretofore. He did not even on this occasion try to veil the
                            absolute denial implied by his words, with the usual phrases of the
                            readiness of the Yamên to come to an understanding, and of its hope that
                            an arrangement might easily be arrived at.</p>

                        <p>With reference to native produce the British minister stated to me some
                            time ago, that when lately at the Yamên, the minister informed him, that
                            after long discussion, the most perfect understanding had been arrived
                            at between them and Mr. von Brandt on every point save one: namely, as
                            to the manner of dealing with produce which having been brought down to
                            the port uncertificated (<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, not protected by
                            transit duty certificate) or which having been purchased in a port and
                            having there been manufactured it was not proposed to export.</p>
                        <p>As there appeared to me some disaccord between this statement and the
                            letters addressed to me by the Yamên, as well as the notes taken by the
                            interpreter of the Legation of conversations at the Yamên, I sent on the
                            9th day of the 12th moon (January 28) Mr. Arendt to the Yamên to
                            ascertain what it was that had been said to the British minister.</p>
                        <p>The ministers present, unfortunately, were unable to give Mr. Arendt a
                            definite answer or to say more than that some days hence it would be in
                            their power to let him know everything for the information of his
                            minister. Not having heard since from the ministers, I feel obliged to
                            request the Yamên to refer to three sets of rules forwarded from the
                            German legation on the 12th day of the 6th moon (July 7, 1881) and to
                            the additional proposals presented by me in person on the 15th day of
                            the 6th moon (July 10) and to state explicitly whether it (the Yamên) is
                            prepared to give effect to all clauses (in the project referred at) with
                            the sole exception of the clause providing for the treatment of produce
                            brought down from the interior uncertificated or purchased in the port
                            and manufactured, but which it is not proposed to export; so that this
                            would be the only one clause with reference to which the Yamên still
                            desires a modification.</p>

                        <p>We have had the honor to receive your excellency’s letter by which you
                            desired us to let you know whether, with regard to native produce, the
                            question of the treatment <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0208"/>of
                            articles manufactured from produce brought down uncertificated to the
                            port, or bought at the port, but not intended for exportation, was the
                            only one point in which we still wished for some modification, whilst
                            all the other points had our complete approval, or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>In reply to this question we beg before all to state that, during the
                            frequent discussions which have taken place betwen your Excellency and
                            ourselves regarding the regulation of the commerce with native produce,
                            we are conscious of having always been actuated in all the transactions
                            by a sincere desire of arriving at a friendly understanding. The
                            proposals in three sections, transmitted to us by your Excellency on the
                            7th of July, appeared in fact to require a separate rearrangement only
                            with regard to those two articles which had reference to articles bought
                            or manufactured at the port, and their exportation; all the other
                            articles, though some slight modification might be desirable in their
                            wording, appeared, upon the whole, quite appropriate for leading to a
                            definite settlement of the whole matter. All at once, however, on the
                            10th of July, your Excellency handed again to us personally a series of
                            additional proposals. In the first of these it was proposed that the
                            last clause of article 3, commencing with the words: in all cases in
                            which goods are to be confiscated, should be removed from this place,
                            and inserted as a separate article behind section 8, whereby the number
                            of the articles would have been augmented to ten altogether. This
                            proposal seemed quite acceptable. But with reference to uncertificated
                            produce, no matter whether brought down to the port from the interior or
                            bought at the port, it had already to be considered as a concession on
                            our part that we had agreed to allow such produce to be subjected to a
                            manufacturing process on previous notice being given to the customs
                            authorities, and furthermore to abstain from demanding the production of
                            the Likin and Inland Duty certificates; but with reference to such
                            uncertificated produce, all the rules regarding limits of time, further
                            conveyance, repacking and export, must be adhered to in exactly the same
                            manner as with reference to produce accompanied by a transit
                            certificate; for this is the only way by which the vital interest of
                            Chinese merchants can be protected. Even therefore a proposal, should
                            such a one be made, to free such produce from the compulsion of being
                            exported against the payment of an additional duty would not do away
                            with the objections which prevent us from agreeing to such a
                            concession.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency having honored us with a question, we have deemed it our
                            duty to reply to it clearly, distinctly, and point by point.</p>

                        <p>I. What do the characters tsze hsiang “this class” of uncertificated

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wang</hi>. The words “this class” have no special
                            meaning; they might as well be omitted; uncertificated produce,
                            generally speaking, is meant.</p>
                        <p>I. But as you write “this class,” this might seem to imply that there is
                            also “that class.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wang</hi>. * * * We Chinese do not make such nice
                            distinctions. You might, I repeat it, as well omit the words “this
                            class,” without modifying the meaning.</p>
                        <p>I. Then all uncertificated produce is meant?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wang</hi>. (Looking at the letter after a short
                            interval.) Yes; the uncertificated produce spoken of in the preceding
                            sentences.</p>
                        <p>I. (Looking at the letter and reading from it.) Ah! I see; the
                            uncertificated produce which has been subjected to a manufacturing
                            process.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Wang</hi>. That does not necessarily follow; the
                            uncertificated produce remaining in its original state is meant as well
                            as that which is subjected to a manufacturing process. You must not make
                            such nice distinctions.</p>
                        <p>I. Very well; I understand now, and believe I have caught your
                            meaning.</p>

                            nationals of all the treaty powers, are entitled, by the express words
                            of the Belgian treaty of 1865, Article XI, the French treaty of 1858,
                            Article VII, and the German treaty of 1861, Article VI, to trade as
                            merchants, and to trade as manufacturers “se livrer au commerce ou à
                            l’industrie.” This is the indisputable meaning of the French text of the
                            three treaties represented by the Chinese words, mau yi kung tso.</p>
                        <p>The construction which the Yamên seek to put upon the words kung tso
                            would limit the exercise of the treaty privilege that they are intended
                            to secure to acts which it would not have required any special treaty

                            Chinese Government officials have ever granted any general permission
                            for missionaries to reside permanently in the interior outside of the
                            treaty limits, as there are several missionaries of the various
                            denominations now residing in various parts of the interior of the
                            Empire. I should be much obliged if you could let me know on what
                            conditions they are permitted to remain there; some difficulty having
                            lately taken place with one of the American missionaries, the Rev. W. K.
                            McKibben, at the town of Fai Poo in the interior, on account of his
                            having rented a house at that place for six months, while traveling
                            under the protection of a passport.</p>
                        <p>If there is any concession made to the missionaries in the northern part
                            of China by which they are allowed to reside in the interior, I should
                            like to secure the same privileges for the missionaries here, as it
                            would doubtless save a great deal of trouble and correspondence with the
                            local officials.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Our consul, Mr. Williams, is writing to
                            you to ascertain on my behalf what is the <hi rend="italic">status</hi>
                            under the treaty of American missionaries in the interior of China.</p>
                        <p>The various treaties clearly recognize and provide for the right of
                            missionaries to trade freely in pursuit of their calling. Nothing is
                            said, so far as I have seen, as to where they may stop, whether in boats
                            or at inns, or in other houses; nor for how long a time they may stay at
                            a place. I suppose, however, the general permission to travel and preach
                            is intended to include such requisites of the missionary’s calling as
                            the privilege of renting houses for chapels and for temporary residence
                            as may be necessary.</p>
                        <p>It is of importance to me to ascertain somewhat more definitely what
                            privileges are recognized as being within, the general scope of treaty
                            provisions. I have frequently seen in the periodicals notices of
                            missionaries having purchased or rented ground and houses at interior
                            places, as at Soochow, Nanking, Kalgan, Tsi Nanfoo, Teun Haw Chan. I
                            have seen the statement made that missionaries may <hi rend="italic"
                                >rent</hi> “t’ung” or chapels, but not purchase them, at interior
                            places. In connection with the case at Teun Haw Chau, between Peking and
                            Tientsin, the statement is made that “the right (missionary) of
                            residence in the interior is officially conceded in the very highest
                            (Chinese) quarters.” (See “Chinese Recorder” for November, December,
                            1880, p. 476.)</p>
                        <p>Whether or not there are restrictions or limitations upon missionaries
                            who wish to avail themselves of this recognized treaty privilege—for
                            instance, as to the length of time he may stay at a place, or as to
                            special passport regulations—I have never heard authoritatively; and I
                            trust that your reply to Consul Williams’s letter may inform me in
                            regard to any usages or regulations to which I will need to conform.</p>

                        <p>I should have mentioned in my account of the difficulty at Fai Poo Hien
                            that the district magistrate to whom I appealed in vain for protection,
                            told me that I had no rights in the city except it were for a few days’
                            residence; and that my having taken lodgings at the inn for a period of
                            six months was more than I had any right to do.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say that I am not seeking for privileges <hi rend="italic"
                                >outside</hi> the treaties, as perhaps some of the consular

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Remembering the kind interest you
                            expressed two years ago in my unsuccessful attempt to obtain a building
                            site at Chow Chow Fu, I recently addressed you a note, through Mr.
                            Williams, asking for information in regard to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >status</hi> of American missionaries in the interior of China. This
                            note made inquiry to the following effect, viz: The various treaties
                            provide that missionaries may travel freely in pursuit of their calling;
                            but they say nothing about where or for how long a time they may stop;
                            what, if any, are the usages or. restrictions to which the missionary
                            should conform?</p>
                        <p>The special occasion for my raising the inquiry is that in November of
                            last year I was mobbed at my inn and driven out of the city of Fai Poo
                            Hien by a mob, led by runners from the Yamên, and apparently with the
                            connivance of the district magistrate. The town of which I speak is
                            about 120 li from Swatow. I reached the place October 26, and put up at
                            the house of a church member. Shortly after I rented some upper rooms of
                            an inn that adjoined. I called a man to patch the floor, and did a
                            little whitewashing, all in the inside, and made no further changes.
                            About November 9 I heard that some of the people were threatening that I
                            should not be allowed to stay. Both in writing and in person I requested
                            the magistrate to take some measures to prevent a disturbance. He
                            promised, but did nothing, and on the 13th he left the city. The next
                            morning a crowd of several hundred men came, who broke up the church
                            member’s shop, destroyed a part of the inn building, and destroyed or
                            carried off a quantity of property. While this was going on I escaped by
                            a back door and made my way to the river, pursued by a part of the mob,
                            who pelted me with stones, sticks of wood &amp;c. A heavy umbrella
                            protected me from injury, and I obtained refuge on a revenue boat.</p>
                        <p>Arriving at Swatow I laid the case before Consul Williams, who has spared
                            no pains to get some of the ringleaders brought to punishment and to
                            secure compensation for damages sustained by the property. The usual
                            Chinese shifts and evasions have been resorted to by the officials, and
                            no very tangible satisfaction has yet been secured. Mr. Williams is
                            exerting himself to the utmost to secure such a measure of satisfaction
                            as will make it safer for missionaries to visit that region hereafter,
                            and which will practically serve the purpose of giving some measure of
                            security to the native Christians of that region. He may find it
                            necessary to refer the case to the higher authorities before it is
                            settled.</p>
                        <p>But a question arises with regard to privileges of missionaries traveling
                            or sojourning in the interior. And it was to ascertain with some degree
                            of definiteness what is recognized as coming within the scope of the
                            treaties that I wrote you through the consular agent.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago I sustained a serious defeat in having my plans thwarted at
                            Chow Chow Fu. It is of great importance to me at this time to be able to
                            avail myself of whatever measure of support a fair interpretation of the
                            treaty may afford. Whatever information or suggestions you may be able
                            to give will be gratefully appreciated.</p>

                            has been made by the Government of China, nor, so far as I understand
                            the policy of the United States, is it prepared to assert any peculiar
                            rights for missionaries which may not, under an honest interpretation of
                            our rights as laid down in the treaties, be demanded for merchants or
                            any other class of citizens.</p>

                        <p>The right to travel under passport in the interior carries with it, by
                            fair and indeed necessary inference, the privilege of <hi rend="italic"
                                >temporary</hi> residence there, but would not justify any assertion
                            of the right to rent or purchase premises for permanent occupation.</p>
                        <p>The “toleration article” may be justly construed as promising the
                            protection of the Chinese Government to chapels and similar places of
                            public worship owned or used by native Christians in all parts of the
                            Empire.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing statement covers, in my opinion, all the rights conceded by
                            treaty to missionaries in China, and as already indicated no other
                            concessions to them have been formally made by the Imperial
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>It is true, on the other hand, as Mr. Williams remarks, that “there are
                            several missionaries of the different denominations now residing in
                            various parts of the interior,” and he very naturally asks, “on what
                            conditions they are permitted to remain there?”</p>
                        <p>Protestant and Romish missionaries are to be found to-day quietly
                            established as permanent residents in very considerable numbers in every
                            province of China. There are fifty-two Protestant missionaries in this
                            province alone, outside of the treaty port of Tientsin, forty-three of
                            whom are Americans. And proclamations have in many instances been issued
                            by the local Chinese authorities declaring the full right of the
                            missionary thus to establish himself and to acquire property in the
                            interior, and warning the populace not to oppose or disturb him in any
                            way. This very marked and valuable advance beyond the strict line of
                            privileges granted by treaty has been gained, not by any formal
                            concession on the part of the Chinese Government, but by the discreet
                            and patient effort of individual missionaries on the one hand and by the
                            liberal and tolerant disposition of the local authorities, influenced
                            more or less by the good will of the people, on the other.</p>
                        <p>Only in very rare cases has there arisen any trouble in connection with
                            these establishments, and in no instance within my knowledge has it been
                            maintained by the local authorities that the missionaries concerned were
                            seeking that which the treaties did not warrant.</p>
                        <p>The policy of the central Government of China in regard to missionary
                            residence in the interior, though never formally enunciated, seems to
                            be, so far as it can be gathered as the result of the discussion of
                            cases which have arisen from time to time, to make no opposition to such
                            residence, to tacitly concede it provided no objection is urged by the
                            authorities of the locality concerned, no disturbance arises, and our
                            people are able to establish themselves and their work quietly. Should
                            the issue be squarely raised by the local authorities of any city or
                            district, that certain missionaries, in seeking to gain a residence
                            among them, were going beyond their rights as4aid down in the treaties,
                            it is in my mind more than doubtful whether the foreign office here
                            would consent to make that issue with the foreign government concerned.
                            They would, however, if I am to judge of the future by the past,
                            doubtless raise imaginary difficulties in the given case, and while
                            carefully avoiding the question of the right of residence in the
                            interior, would give practical support to the opposition raised by their
                            local officers.</p>
                        <p>The policy of our own government in the question under discussion is
                            plain and well defined. While it does not claim for any class of its
                            people the right to reside permanently beyond the limits of the open
                            ports, it appreciates the self-denial and philanthropic motives of the
                            missionary, and is disposed rather to congratulate than to censure him
                            if, by wise and patient effort to conciliate the good will of the
                            natives, he is able quietly to extend his operations beyond treaty
                            limits, and to develop his benevolent work in the heart of this vast
                            Empire. It certainly does not enter into the wish or purpose of the
                            Government or of this Legation to repress or hamper the wider action
                            upon which American missionaries have entered, to advise any retreat
                            from the advanced ground which has been taken with the tacit consent of
                            the Imperial Government, or to fail in taking rightful measures for
                            their protection whenever it may become necessary. On the contrary the
                            Government of the United States will be found ready to give such moral
                            support and encouragement and practical protection to its <pb n="141"
                                xml:id="pg_141" facs="0213"/>missionary citizens, either at the
                            ports or in the interior, as their valuable work may justly deserve, and
                            a sound policy and their manifest rights under the treaties may
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>It may be a legitimate question for discussion, whether the Chinese
                            Government by this tacit acquiescence in the process which has been
                            going on for more that twenty years, and which has resulted in the
                            permanent establishment of missionaries in considerable numbers in every
                            province, may or may not be held to have positively conceded the right
                            of such residence. Prescription and precedent reckon for more in China
                            than in western nations, and may establish “quasi” rights, which, while
                            not conferred by the letter of treaty, are nevertheless entitled to
                            official recognition.</p>
                        <p>Be this as it may, our treaties with this Empire specifically guarantee
                            to all citizens of the United States in every part of China entire
                            immunity from every species of insult or injury whether to persons or
                            property. Nothing can be more explicit than the language of Article XI
                            of the treaty of Tientsin upon this point. Our people are entitled to,
                            and must receive the full benefit of this stipulation wherever they may
                            be in China. For any supposed or actual breach or excess of treaty
                            rights they may be proceeded against by clearly defined, methods before
                            the duly authorized officers of our government. But under no
                            circumstances will the Government of the United States allow its
                            citizens, whether residing within or without the so-called treaty
                            limits, to be subjected to mob violence, to be violently expelled from
                            this or that district by illegal means, or to have their lives or
                            property jeopardized in any manner except by due process of law.</p>

                        <head><hi rend="smallcaps">the french in tonquin.</hi></head>
                        <p>After many and prolonged delays, the French Government have at length
                            dispatched an expedition to Tonquin. What that force is intended to
                            accomplish, or what the ultimate aim of the French authorities may be,
                            has not been officially disclosed. What is actually known is that there
                            are now about a thousand French troops in Haiphong and Hanoi, and that
                            they await further orders. The Saigon paper L’Indo-Chine Francaise does
                            not hesitate to say that the annexation of Tonquin is the ultimate
                            object of the French Government. This is what we have always believed
                            and what we have consistently advocated. Tonquin is now subject to
                            Annamese misrule and oppression, and the people would gladly change
                            masters; the revolution could be accomplished by merely driving out the
                            Annamese officials, who have no considerable force to back up their
                            pretensions and are utterly incapable of opposing any effective
                            resistance to French usurpation. So far, though the French have landed
                            several hundred troops in the capital of Tonquin, not a blow has been
                            struck. The Annamese apparently hardly know what to expect. They must be
                            aware, however, that the French have come to insist upon the provisions
                            of the treaty of 1874 being faithfully carried out, and that their
                            visitors are prepared to back up their demand with force if necessary.
                            The French have obviously decided that the trade route to Yunnan by the
                            Song-Hoi, or Red River, shall be opened up. This is an important
                            stipulation of the treaty of 1874 which has been coolly and uniformly
                            ignored by the Annamese mandarins, who doubtless see in it a blow to the
                            exercise of their nefarious <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0214"
                            />system of squeezing the poor natives on whom they fatten and thrive.
                            The obstacles to the free navigation of the Song-Hoi will first be
                            removed, and, meanwhile, the French troops will probably occupy the
                            chief towns of Tonquin, quietly displacing the Annamese garrisons and
                            substituting French authority and rule for that of the Annamese
                            mandarins. It is not unlikely that this will be accomplished without any
                            effusion of blood, for the Annamese are not a fighting race and have
                            already had experience of French prowess. Should they, however, offer
                            resistance, the task of the French may be somewhat protracted but cannot
                            be defeated, while the conflict might eventuate in the tricolor being
                            hoisted at Hué and the Emperor Tu Duc losing his throne. Our Saigon
                            contemporary makes no secret of its aspiration for the extension of
                            French supremacy over the whole of Cochin China and Cambodia, and though
                            it is very doubtful whether the present French Government have such
                            ambitious designs, they might, if involved in a troublesome struggle
                            with Annam, be tempted to give it a final issue by subjugating the
                            entire country. We are, however, of opinion that no such scheme is now
                            entertained, and that the French Government are chiefly concerned to
                            give due effect to the stipulations of the treaty of 1874; these once
                            definitely secured, the annexation of Tonquin may be deferred to a more
                            convenient season, and the fall of the Annamese monarchy be postponed
                            indefinitely.—(China Overland Trade Report.)</p>

                        last, in relation to the residence of American missionaries in the interior
                        of China, has been received. His exposition of the rights of citizens of the

                        date, is regarded as a very clear and discreet statement of what may
                        properly be claimed under the stipulations of existing treaties for our
                        citizens, residents in China, whether engaged in the calling of missionaries
                        or in any other pursuit, and meets with the unqualified approval of the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In making the voyage from the United States to
                        Colombia we must embark at New York, either for Aspinwall or Sabanilla; for
                        between our southern ports and those of Colombia there is no direct line of
                        communication, nor is there any direct line between the ports of Cuba and
                        those of Colombia. Between New York and Sabanilla there is now, however, a
                        direct line of ocean steamers, owned by an American company; but, under our
                        present navigation laws, these steamers can neither obtain an American
                        register nor sail under the American flag.</p>
                    <p>By embarking on a steamer of this new line—the North and South <pb n="143"
                            xml:id="pg_143" facs="0215"/>American Steam Navigation Company—we should
                        reach Cartajena or Sabanilla within eight days, making one call at the
                        Bahamas.</p>
                    <p>Cartajena, as you are aware, is one of the oldest of the Spanish American
                        seaports. In the time of Philip the Second it was one of the strongest naval
                        stations in the world. Its fortifications, still in fair condition, seem to
                        have been constructed without regard to expense, and for all time. The
                        massive walls of the city are still, to all appearances, impregnable, and
                        the ancient subterranean passes leading outward to the foot-hills of the
                        adjacent mountains are still visible. The entrance to the magnificent harbor
                        is studded with ancient fortifications, which, though now unused for more
                        than half a century, seem almost as good as new. Formally, the city was
                        connected by ship channel with the river Magdalena, at a point many leagues
                        above the delta, and was, therefore, in easy communication with the fertile
                        valleys and plateaux of the interior; the gate of commerce in time of peace,
                        and secure alike from protracted siege or successful assault in time of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The decline of Cartajena seems to have commenced with the present century,
                        and to have steadily continued to within the past fifteen years, when the
                        commerce of the country began to revive. In the mean time the ship canal,
                        connecting the port with the great fluvial highway of the interior, having
                        fallen into disuse, became filled up and overgrown with tropical jungle; so
                        that the few foreign trading vessels visiting the coast sought harborage
                        farther up, within easy distance of the river, near the present site of
                        Sabanilla. Meantime, the short railway of 14 miles, which connects this new
                        harbor of Sabanilla with the river at Barranquilla, had been projected and
                        built by a German company; and thus, through the apparent apathy of its
                        property owners, Cartajena found itself supplanted by Barranquilla—a new
                        city of some 25,000 inhabitants, the outgrowth of steam navigation on the
                        Magdalena. But the harbor of Sabanilla, though now the principal one of the
                        republic, is neither convenient nor safe. It is shallow, full of shifting
                        sand-bars, and exposed to furious wind-storms; while the new port of
                        Barranquilla is quite inaccessible from the delta, by reason of its
                        treacherous sandbars. So that, with the opening of the ancient dique or ship
                        channel between Cartajena and Calamar, or the construction of a railway
                        between the first named point and Barranquilla (both of which enterprises
                        are being agitated), Cartajena will regain her ancient prestige and become
                        the chief port of the republic.</p>
                    <p>The great valley of the Magdalena, extending from the Caribbean coast to the
                        equatorial line, is one of inexhaustible natural resources. Its width varies
                        from 100 to 150 miles before gradually sloping to a point on the northern
                        borders of Equador. At the mouth of the river Cauca this valley branches off
                        into another of less general width but of greater elevation, and
                        consequently possessing a more equable and temperate climate. The river
                        Cauca is itself navigable by light-draught steamers as far up as Cali, a
                        point less than 80 miles from the port of Buenaventura, on the Pacific
                        coast.</p>
                    <p>The lower valley of the Magdalena is one vast alluvial plain, a large portion
                        of which is subject to periodical overflow. In fact, during the rainy
                        season, the greater portion of it is usually under water. This, however,
                        might be prevented, and the fertile lands reclaimed, by a system of dikes
                        far less expensive than those on the lower Mississippi. But in a country
                        like this, where population is sparse, and nature lavish in her bounties,
                        such enterprises are not readily undertaken.</p>
                    <p>As we ascend the river to a point some 250 miles above Barranquilla, the
                        banks become higher and better defined. Here inundations are <pb n="144"
                            xml:id="pg_144" facs="0216"/>infrequent, and the soil incredibly
                        fertile. In the days of the Spanish viceroyalty this was the garden of New
                        Granada, and traces of the magnificent estates of the old hidalgos are still
                        visible. But these rich plantations seem to have been abandoned when
                        emancipation of negro slavery was proclaimed in 1824; and few of them have
                        since been reclaimed. They are now mere grazing grounds for immense herds of
                        ungroomed and almost unattended cattle, and many of them are completely
                        overgrown by thick, impenetrable jungle and forest. The negro and his
                        descendants, who now inhabit this once prosperous region, lives an idle,
                        shiftless sort of life, subsisting upon the indigenous fruits and fish.
                        Agriculture receives very little attention, and cattle-breeding is the chief
                        industry, even among the more ambitious and enterprising of the inhabitants.
                        Within the past few years, however, there has been a very marked
                        improvement. A number of small villages and trading stations have sprung up
                        all along the margins of the river, where small merchants have established a
                        kind of barter trade, and ship fruits, cattle, hides, eggs, poultry and palm
                        nuts to the coast, receiving in return small supplies of foreign goods, such
                        as cotton cloth, cheap jewelry and other small articles of American, English
                        or German manufacture. But the chief commerce of the river is the carrying
                        trade between Barran-quilla and Honda; the last named place being the great
                        inter-depot for the shipment of coffee, indigo, tobacco, quina bark, hides,
                        minerals, and other exports of the interior table lands of the Andes. This
                        trade now employs over twenty river steamers, besides a number of <hi
                            rend="italic">bungoes</hi> which constantly ply between the two points
                        named.</p>
                    <p>The river itself is one of the physical curiosities of this region. With its
                        source a little southward of the equatorial line, it flows in general
                        direction due northward with a current of greater average rapidity than the
                        Mississippi, and carries an average volume of water nearly as great. Its
                        waters, always muddy, are often so charged with sand and sediment that a
                        tinkling metallic sound is distinctly audible from the upper deck of the
                        steamer. In many places it is full of counter-currents and whirlpools, not
                        unlike those seen in the great Yangtze in eastern Asia, uprooting trees and
                        cutting away the loaming banks, filling in new islands and carrying away old
                        ones, and thus constantly changing its main channel. In some places its
                        waters are expanded over an immense plain to the width of from two to five
                        miles; in others they are forced into a narrow channel between the extending
                        foot-hills of the adjacent mountains where the rapidity of the current
                        renders its ascent by steamers difficult and dangerous. Thus, from Nare to
                        Honda, a distance of some two hundred miles, it is little else than a mere
                        succession of whirlpools and cataracts; and the motive power of the steamers
                        being necessarily out of all proportion to their tonnage, accidents and
                        wrecks are not unusual. No wonder that, on a river like this, freights are
                        incredibly high and the rates of insurance beyond precedent.</p>
                    <p>The entire distance from Barranquilla to Honda, following the tortuous course
                        of the river, is 780 miles, and the voyage usually requires from ten to
                        twenty days, according to the state of the water. In making it we pass
                        through three distinct grades or belts of country, distinct alike as to
                        soil, topography, climate, scenery, and the general appearance and character
                        of the inhabitants. The first 200 miles is, as I have said, little else than
                        an expanse of swamp, overgrown by reeds and rushes alternated by occasional
                        spots of dry laud, inhabited only by negroes and mulattoes. The next 300
                        miles is likewise a vast plain on either side, but seldom subject to
                        overflow; the site of abandoned plantations alternated by dense forest and
                        occasional patches of maize and banana.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0217"/>
                    <p>The mango and the plantain are indigenous, and the bread-fruit and calabash
                        tree are often seen. The remainder of the journey is through the volcanic
                        region, where the fertility of the soil, salubrity of the climate, and
                        majesty and grandeur of the scenery combine to make a most desirable
                        country, but which has been heretofore carefully avoided by the industrious
                        emigrant for the sole reason, perhaps, that its government has been too
                        unsettled or unstable to insure protection to the rights of person and
                        property.</p>
                    <p>The inhabitants of this volcanic region differ as widely from those of the
                        coast and lower valley as the two regions of country differ in general
                        aspect; and this difference is equally well defined whether we regard their
                        peculiarities of dialect, their personal appearance, or their daily habits
                        of thought and life. The Indian and his descendants, who constitute the
                        basis of population in the upper valley, are deferential and often courteous
                        in manner and language; while the negro and his descendants, who constitute
                        the basis of the population in the lower valley, are usually irreverent,
                        aggressive, quarrelsome, and shamelessly immoral. The uplander speaks the
                        Castilian with tolerable accuracy and purity, while the lowlander employs a
                        kind of jargon which is often unintelligible even to his own countrymen of
                        the table lands. The Indian seldom drinks anything stronger than a decoction
                        of molasses and maize, called <hi rend="italic">chiche</hi>, which, although
                        very stupefying, is never intoxicating, while the mulatto drinks a vile
                        species of native brandy, called <hi rend="italic">aguardiente</hi>, which
                        is very fiery and intoxicating. Both peoples are very superstitious, but in
                        opposite directions. The highlander believes in modern miracles, spiritual
                        epiphanies, and angelic guidance and visitations, and is governed almost
                        entirely by a deep religious sentiment, directed by the Roman Church. The
                        lowerlander believes in charms, incantations, and witchcraft, but pays
                        little or no attention to the church or its requirements. The first seems to
                        delight in rendering a kind and hospitable service without expecting
                        anything in return; the second never thinks of doing a kind or benevolent
                        act or of rendering a polite service, without pay. The one is reticent and
                        dignified, often evasive and untruthful, but never uncivil or inhospitable;
                        the other is garrulous, profane, and often uncivil, ready to assert his
                        fancied “equality” upon all possible occasions, quick to quarrel, and
                        difficult to appease when excited or angry. The Indian is naturally docile,
                        obedient to authority, and conservative in his habits of thought and life.
                        The mulatto, on the other hand, is a constitutional pessimist, and is ready
                        for a “revolution” upon short notice and upon the slightest pretext.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: From Honda, the head of steam navigation on
                        the Magdalena, to Bogota, the capital of the Colombian Republic, the journey
                        must be made on mule-back. The distance is less than 70 miles, although it
                        usually requires from three to four days to complete it. However, within the
                        last few years a line of coaches has been established between the federal
                            <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0218"/>capital and Agrialarge, a
                        stopping place some 30 miles distant from Bogotà; so that the journey by
                        mule-back has been reduced to about 40 miles.</p>
                    <p>After perfecting all necessary arrangements the day previous, the traveler
                        rises at six, takes a light breakfast of chocolate and bread, and. hopes to
                        be on the way by seven. But people here take life easily. Servants and
                        guides and muleteers make no note of time, and it is quite useless to try to
                        hurry them, so that if he gets fairly under way by ten o’clock he is
                        fortunate. Ashe ascends a spur of the eastern Cordillera there is revealed
                        to him a most enchanting view of the surrounding country; the atmosphere is
                        singularly clear, pure, and exhilarating, and he breathes more deeply and
                        easily; the senses are no longer oppressed by the sultry heats and
                        intoxicating perfumes of the valley; the limbs recover their wonted
                        elasticity, and the mind seems more clear and active.</p>
                    <p>Just beyond the deep, broad valley of the Magdalena, are the snowcapped
                        mountains of Tolima. They seem marvelously near, and yet they are more than
                        100 miles distant; so very clear and transparent is the pure ethereal
                        atmosphere of this elevated region. In the opposite direction is the
                        dish-shaped valley of Guaduas, fringed with luxuriant foliage of the coffee
                        plantations and the virgin forests of emerald green. In the center of this
                        valley reposes the parochial village, with its church steeples reaching
                        upward as if in feeble imitation of the adjacent mountain peaks. This valley
                        of Guaduas is over 3,000 feet above the sea level, and has, therefore, an
                        equable and temperate climate. But the atmosphere is quite damp, and
                        rheumatism, diptheria, and goitre are among the prevalent maladies of the
                        place. The population of the village is about 20,000, the basis of which is
                        the Chibcha Indian, the race which inhabited this country at the time of the
                        conquest by Quesada, in 1537. But here, as elsewhere in the Andes, the
                        Indian has lost his race identity by amalgamation with the Castilian, and a
                        Chibcha of pure blood is seldom seen except in the more remote rural
                        districts. The negro and his descendants are seldom seen here. They seem to
                        thrive best in the hot, malarious region of the coast and on the margins of
                        the great rivers.</p>
                    <p>The next village of importance is Villete. It has a population of about
                        2,000, mostly Indians and mixed-breeds. Its elevation is only about 600 feet
                        above the sea level, and has an average temperature of about 85°. Though
                        quite hot, the atmosphere is singularly dry and sanitary, and the place is
                        often resorted to by invalids from Bogota and the more elevated regions.</p>
                    <p>The valley is watered by the Rio Negro; justly so named, for its waters are
                        as black as ink, so rendered by their passage through the coal and mineral
                        deposits along the foot-hills of the Sierra. Near by are a noted sulphur
                        spring and the extinct volcano which Humboldt describes as likely, one day,
                        to break out afresh and destroy this beautiful valley.</p>
                    <p>Up to this point our journey has been alternating between deep valleys and
                        dizzy mountain peaks. We cross one only to encounter another. Such is the
                            <hi rend="italic">Camino Real</hi> or “Royal Highway,” the only
                        available route between the Colombian capital and the outside world. Within
                        the past few years it has been much improved, it is true, and at great
                        expense to the government; but it is still little else than a mere mule
                        trail, not wide enough in many places for two mules to walk abreast, and so
                        tortuous and precipitous as to be impassable except on the backs of animals
                        trained to the road. When we reflect that this is the overland highway of an
                        immense commerce, and that it has been in constant use since <pb n="147"
                            xml:id="pg_147" facs="0219"/>the Spanish conquest, we naturally marvel
                        that it is no better. It seems to have been constructed without any previous
                        survey whatever, and without the least regard for comfort or convenience,
                        making short curves where curves are quite unnecessary, or going straight
                        over some mountain spur or peak when the ascent might have been rendered
                        less difficult by easy curves. But, to the observant traveler, the
                        inconveniences and hardships of the journey are, in some measure,
                        compensated by the varied and captivating scenery. He passes through a
                        variety of climates within a few hours’ ride. At one time he is ascending a
                        dizzy steep by a sort of rustic stairway hewn into the rock-ribbed mountain,
                        where the air reminds him of a chilly November morning; a few hours later he
                        is descending to the region of the plantain and the banana, where the summer
                        never ends, and the rank crops of fruits and flowers chase each other in
                        unbroken circle from January to December. On the bleak crests of the <hi
                            rend="italic">paramos</hi> he encounters neither tree nor shrub; where a
                        few blades of sedge and the flitting of a few sparrows give the only
                        evidences of vegetable or animal life; while in the deep valley just below,
                        the dense groves of palm and cottonwood are alive with birds of rich and
                        varied plumage, and the air seems loaded with floral perfumes until the
                        senses fairly ache with their sweetness.</p>
                    <p>Agrialarge is, as I have said, the last stopping place before exchanging the
                        saddle mule for the coach. It is a little settlement of a few hundred
                        inhabitants, situated on the eastern crest of the Cordillera which surrounds
                        the vast altiplane of Bogotá. We here dismiss our faithful mule, and take
                        coach or omnibus for the cities of the plain. The transition from the
                        intense midsummer heats of Villete, to the bleak Novemberblasts of
                        Agrialarge, has been a journey of but a few hours. Our ears and finger-tips
                        ache with cold, and a strange numbness is felt in every limb. But the
                        descent to the edge of the plain is rapid, and within thirty minutes we are
                        greeted by the clear, bright rays of perpetual spring. The ripening wheat
                        fields, fringed by primroses and perennial flowers, alternated by green
                        pastures filled with sleek herds of sheep and cattle, afford a landscape
                        worthy of the artist’s pencil or the poet’s enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>This plain is the traditional elysium of the ancient Chibchas, and their
                        imperial capital was near the site of the present capital of Colombia; and
                        perhaps around no one spot on the American continent cluster so many legends
                        of the aborigines, or quite so many improbable stories illustrative of the
                        ancient civilization. Here one can almost imagine himself in the north
                        temperate zone, and in a country inhabited by a race wholly different from
                        the people heretofore seen in the republic. Agriculture and the useful arts
                        seem at least a century ahead of those on the coast and in the torrid
                        valleys of the great rivers. The ox-cart and plantation wagon have
                        supplanted the traditional pack-mule and ground sled. The neat iron spade
                        and patent plow, have taken the place of wooden shovels and clumsy forked
                        sticks. The inclosures are of substantial stone or adobe; and the spacious
                        farm-house or <hi rend="italic">quinta</hi> has an air of palatial elegance
                        compared with the mud and bamboo hut of the Magdalena. The people have a
                        clear, ruddy complexion, at least compared with those heretofore seen in the
                        country; and their dialect is a near approach to the rich and sonorous
                        Castilian, once so liquid and harmonious in poetry and song, so majestic and
                        persuasive on the forum. None of these agricultural implements and none of
                        these commodious coaches and omnibuses were manufactured here, nor elsewhere
                        in Colombia. They have all been imported from the United States or England.
                        They were brought to Honda, packed in small sections, by the liver steamers,
                        and thence lugged over the mountains, piece by piece.</p>
                    <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0220"/>
                    <p>One peon will carry a wheel, another an axle, a third a coupling pole or
                        single-tree, and the screws and bolts are packed in small boxes on cargo
                        mules. The upper part or “body” of the vehicle is likewise taken to pieces
                        and packed in sections. One man will sometimes be a month in carrying a
                        wagon wheel from Honda to the plain. His method is to carry it some 50 or
                        100 paces and then rest, making sometimes less than 2 miles a day. When the
                        vehicle finally reaches the plain, the pieces are collected and put together
                        by some smithy, who may have learned the art from an American or English
                        mechanic. One scarcely knows which ought to be the greater marvel, the
                        failure to manufacture all these things in a country where woods and coal
                        and iron are so abundant, or the obstacles that are overcome in their
                        successful and profitable importation from foreign countries.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy
                        and translation of a bill, in relation to American salted meats, which was
                        introduced in the Chamber on the 14th instant by Mr. Faure, deputy and under
                        secretary of commerce.</p>
                    <p>This bill repeals the decree prohibiting the importation of American pork,
                        and provides for its introduction into France upon certain restrictions,
                        which will, I believe, practically result in its free admission.</p>
                    <p>The minister in presenting this bill explained the reasons which dictated its
                        action.</p>
                    <p>At the time the decree was issued, anxiety and alarm existed; microscopic
                        examination could not be resorted to, and prohibition under the
                        circumstances was necessary. But since that time nearly all the chambers of
                        commerce of France have protested against the measure, and the government
                        has been led to question seriously the propriety of maintaining it.</p>
                    <p>A careful examination elicited the fact that from 1878 to 1880, 95,000,000
                        kilograms of American pork were consumed in France without danger, and that
                        Belgium, where the consumption is about six times as large as in France, and
                        England, where it is eight times as large, did not suffer at all from
                        trichinosis.</p>
                    <p>It was found besides that the cooking of the meat afforded an additional
                        protection against trichinosis to the one already secured by its process of
                        curing.</p>
                    <p>Upon the evidence of these facts the committee of public hygiene rescinded
                        its former advice, and declared that in its opinion prohibition was
                        unnecessary, provided the meat introduced into France was well cured. The
                        government therefore proposes the free admission of American pork upon the
                        conditions stated in the bill.</p>
                    <p>It has taken nearly two years to establish the fact that the remonstrances
                            <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0221"/>which our government made from
                        the beginning to this unjustifiable measure, and which have been constantly
                        pressed upon the French authorities by my predecessor and myself, were just
                        and well founded in every respect.</p>
                    <p>I regret that the bill proposed still maintains the prohibition of sausages
                        and hashed meat, the reasons for which I do not understand.</p>
                    <p>But as the bill is, if its provisions are applied in a liberal spirit, as I
                        believe they will be, our packers will have no reason to complain.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        your dispatch No. 96, of date February 10, conveying the gratification of
                        the Department for the information that the decree of the French Government
                        prohibiting the importation of American pork would probably soon be
                        repealed.</p>
                    <p>With the defeat of the Gambetta cabinet, which was pledged to the withdrawal
                        of the decree, * * I regret to say that the prospects of an equitable and
                        liberal settlement of this long-pending question are not now as favorable as
                        heretofore.</p>
                    <p>The bill, which was drawn up by the late minister of commerce, of which I
                        gave you the substance in my No. 107, is still before the Chamber, and will
                        not, I think, be withdrawn. But it is somewhat doubtful whether the
                        committee to which it was referred will now report it favorably.</p>
                    <p>I must state that the renewal of the objection made to the importation of
                        American pork is not to be attributed solely to the hostile influence of * *
                        those who have adverse private interests in the matter, but mainly to the
                        publication in some American papers of supposed fatal cases of trichinosis.
                        These reports, which have been circulated, unfortunately, by the American
                        Correspondence, a New York Franco-American weekly sheet, printed partly in
                        French, are copied by the French papers, and its paragraphs upon American
                        trichinosis have received a rather wide circulation. I inclose herewith, for
                        your information, two of these paragraphs, which appeared in the
                        correspondence of January 28 and February 11.</p>
                    <p>Many people have called at the legation to ascertain if there was any
                        foundation for these reports. I have not hesitated to declare that, in my
                        opinion, they were spurious, and that there was nothing like an epidemic of
                        trichinosis existing in the United States. It might, however, be useful if I
                        could speak with official authority from the State Department in the
                        matter.</p>

                        <p>Like all Americans, we regret that the Chamber of Deputies did not
                            instruct the government to allow salt provisions from the United States
                            to he admitted without restrictions, as we were in hopes that they
                            would, and so expressed ourselves in our last number.</p>
                        <p>We are confident, at any rate, that the French legislators will continue
                            to overlook the publication, in papers opposed to free importation, of
                            numerous cases of trichinosis, more in fact than have really occurred.
                            Reliance can he placed upon our statement that there were only six cases
                            last week, of which four were fatal, and but two this, week, which shows
                            conclusively that trichinosis is a scarecrow, which has been made too
                            much of.</p>
                        <p>We also expressed the apprehension that the Chamber of Deputies at Paris
                            would take offense at being placed by the government on the same level
                            with American corporations, <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0223"/>or
                            even with the petty legislatures of separate States, with which it is
                            proposed to treat (and not with the American Congress) for licensing as
                            experts those persons in America whose duty it will be to issue
                            certificates of the wholesomeness of such provisions as they may agree
                            to admit into France.</p>
                        <p>But it would appear, unfortunately, that such appointments as experts are
                            contrary to the laws of the United States, as we are informed by a
                            friend and correspondent, who is a well-known jurist and was, at one
                            time, a United States judge:</p>
                        <p>“I call your attention to the text of the law as proposed, which will
                            require the exporter to produce an inspection certificate from this side
                            to identify the soundness of the provisions. It will be exceedingly
                            difficult, if not impossible, to comply with such a requirement, for the
                            simple reason that in this State and in Pennsylvania, if not in all the
                            other States of the Union, there are no authorized legal inspectors.</p>
                        <p>“It is a matter of history that the inspection laws, formerly existing in
                            this country, requiring the inspection of exports and brands of the
                            board, on casks, barrels, or. packages, hurt the sale of the article in
                            the foreign market.</p>
                        <p>“It is unnecessary to detail the reason, but the abuse was so flagrant
                            that in New York the constitution of the State forbids forever the
                            appointment of inspectors or boards of inspection; and so it is in
                            Pennsylvania.</p>
                        <p>“Whence is the exporter to obtain the inspection certificates demanded by
                            the French law? In this country the purchaser must look out for himself.
                            He has no other protection than the punishment of the person who
                            knowingly sells putrid or-unwholesome food.</p>
                        <p>“It is otherwise in France and other foreign countries, whose governments
                            deem it their duty to add to the common law requirements and <hi
                                rend="italic">a priori</hi> evidence that the article offered is
                            sound.</p>
                        <p>“It is supposed that perhaps an inspection in the interior, or the place
                            of manufacture, say at Cincinnati or at Chicago, &amp;c., by private
                            parties would be sufficient.</p>
                        <p>“This is a delusive idea. The French bill requires the inspection by a
                            competent, impartial, and disinterested expert authorized by the local
                            government; but, whilst there may be voluntary inspectors, they are not
                            the class to which France looks for the protection of the lives and
                            health of its inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>“In the next place, neither of these centers is the point of export. The
                            shipment to France is made here in vessels loading at this port, but
                            pending the transit from the interior to the shipboard, on which the
                            package will leave this country, there are so many opportunities of
                            fraudulent marks, substitution of packages, and other tricks of trade
                            that the original certificate, if in all respects correct, would not be
                            proof of the indentity of the article finally consigned to Havre. Nor
                            will the French consular certificate of authenticity of signature,
                            &amp;c., be of any avail. The French market still regrets with sorrow
                            the certificate of authenticity of the signature to a document,
                            pretending to emanate from authority, that Fremont’s notorious Memphis
                            and El Paso Railroad was a duly recognized and saleable stock at the
                            regular New York Stock Exchange—a paper by which millions of French

                            France is the absolute and unconditional repeal of the existing
                            ordinance. The Chamber will not permit a change which can easily be
                            evaded by illegitimate means. Will it permit a trade in natural course?
                            This is the question.”</p>

                                <p>Great excitement has been caused here by trichinæ poisoning from
                                    eating raw ham.</p>

                                <p>Names and details are given, all which seems flatly to contradict
                                    those sanguine persons who, like ourselves persistently maintain
                                    that the French Government ought to withdraw the prohibitive
                                    decree. It shows, at any rate, that the cases of trichinosis
                                    mentioned by us in our last number were not at all exaggerated.
                                    We say again that these are special and particular cases, and
                                    that they prove nothing in a general way. It should be noted
                                    that in the above instance those who died had eaten raw ham.</p>
                                <p>In France it is <hi rend="italic">always eaten cooked</hi>. Hence
                                    there is no cause for alarm. No uneasiness need be felt either

                                    leading speculators, such as Messrs. Armour, Fowler, &amp;c.,
                                    which they introduee in a roundabout way into France, where it
                                    is consumed without apprehension or suspicion of its American

                        <p>The movement to bring about a withdrawal of the decrees prohibiting the
                            importation of American provisions into Europe, and particularly into
                            France, continues to be carried on under unfavorable circumstances. As
                            the American Correspondence has been predicting for a year past, the
                            results have hitherto been negative. Matters are even worse at present,
                            because speculation has thrust itself so deeply into this question,
                            which Mr. Levi P. Morton, the American minister, is trying so
                            strenuously to settle, because he knows what privations the laboring
                            classes in Europe and what losses the American cattle-raisers are
                            suffering, by reason of the prohibitive decrees. But the large
                            speculators do not care much for that. Operators for a rise have
                            published in certain papers that the decree had been abrogated in France
                            by the Chamber, simply because a bill has been introduced by the
                            government, which will soon be buried out of sight, if people believe in
                            France the exaggerated accounts of trichinosis published in certain
                            other papers, under sensational headings, like the following: <quote

                                <p>The News says, with reference to the Jaeger family, five in
                                    number, who are suffering from trichinæ poisoning:</p>
                                <p>“They suffer intensely. No immediate danger is anticipated, but
                                    their ultimate recovery is doubtful. The girl, aged fifteen, and
                                    her sister, aged five, are in a very bad condition. No hopes are
                                    entertained of their recovery. The balance may survive. The
                                    oldest child was working in the country and came home to wait on
                                    the family, and ate once of the diseased meat. She has a very
                                    mild form of trichinosis.”</p>
                                <p>It will be observed that this does not refer to the same case as
                                    that of which we deemed it our duty to publish the true
                                    particulars, because they had been too much magnified by some
                                    papers. These exaggerations originate with the bear speculators,
                                    who are well aware that if they should only hear in France of
                                    any new cases of trichinosis in this country, they would never
                                    venture to withdraw the prohibitive decrees. For this reason we
                                    desire to caution the French public and government once more not
                                    to attach any credit to exaggerated accounts like the above.</p>

                                    of this kind of meat, especially in the army and the large
                                    manufacturing and industrial districts, the disease called

                                    produced by indigenous pork, has not been observed in any part

                                    habits, pork being never eaten in France without having been
                                    submitted to such a temperature in cooking as is incompatible

                                    difficulty applied to the enormous mass of ninety millions of
                                    pounds of pork, which is the annual amount of importation, and
                                    that, in any case, the inspection would not prove to be a
                                    certain guarantee of the innocuity of the pork as. regards
                                    trichinæ, since the irregularity of the dissemination of
                                    trichinæ does not permit the conclusion that because they do not
                                    exist in one part they may not exist in another, is of the
                                    opinion that it is not necessary to submit imported pork to a

                                    infection, the culinary habits of the people of France being

                                    dangers of the use of raw or incompletely cooked pork, to point

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to inform you on the 28th and
                        29th instant by cable that the pork bill had passed the Chamber with an
                        amendment aiming at the re-establishment of microscopic examination. I
                        transmit herewith copies of my telegrams and a translation of the text of
                        the bill as it passed the Chamber.</p>
                    <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0226"/>
                    <p>The amendment introduced by the opponents of the free admission into France
                        of our pork is contained in the three last paragraphs of article 2. It does
                        not provide in terms for microscopic examination, but the debates show that
                        it is intended to secure that result. The minister of commerce, Mr. Tirard,
                        who agreed to it, and has secured its passage, is well known to be in favor
                        of this mode of inspection, and to hold that it is the only one by which any
                        effective guarantee can be given. In a conversation which I had with him the
                        day before the debate he expressed this opinion, and remarked that there was
                        a strong prejudice in France against American pork; that it would find no
                        sale, although it might be perfectly sound, unless some kind of inspection
                        was required which would satisfy the public. He discussed the question in a
                        friendly manner, and intimated that the inspection, if required by the new
                        law, could be made easy, and would become more and more so, if all meats
                        were found to be in a sound condition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Archard, of Bordeaux, the chairman of the committee who reported the bill
                        during the debate read your telegram, copy of which I had furnished him,
                        denying the existence of trichinosis in the United States, and made an able
                        argument in favor of his bill, claiming that the prohibition was
                        unjustifiable, that our pork was perfectly healthy, and that, even should it
                        be unhealthy, no inspection or examination of such quantities could be in
                        any way effective. His speech is too long to be translated, but by referring
                        to the Journal Officiel of the 28th and 29th, which goes regularly to the
                        Department, you will find it in full, with the whole proceedings.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the Senate will pass the bill without change.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I regret to have to inform the Department that
                        the pork bill, of which a copy was sent with my dispatch No. 146, of March
                        31, 1882, was defeated in the Senate a few days ago.</p>
                    <p>This result was quite unexpected. The bill had the unequivocal support of the
                        government, and of the senate committee, to which it had been referred. The
                        chairman of this committee, Senator Wurtz, the eminent chemist, and dean
                        of-the Academy of Medicine, reported the bill in the strongest language
                        possible, showing, by conclusive proofs and arguments, that the trichinæ,
                        wherever it existed, could not resist the double process of salting and
                        cooking, and that, with a proper inspection, the introduction into France of
                        our fully cured pork could not be attended with any danger or inconvenience.
                        Mr. Tirard, the minister of commerce, advocated the passage of the bill on
                        the same ground. The opposition, which came mainly from the hog-raising
                        departments, contended that if there were no danger in allowing the free
                        introduction of American meats into France, the government could remove the
                        decree of prohibition without any law, and succeeded in defeating the bill
                        by a majority of four votes.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor of informing you that the
                        persistent efforts of this legation in view of obtaining from the French
                        Government the right <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0228"/>for American
                        corporations doing business in France to be considered and treated on the
                        same footing as those of other countries have at last resulted in a measure
                        giving us this long desired satisfaction. A decree dated the 6th instant and
                        issued the 9th, a copy and translation of which are herewith inclosed,
                        grants to American corporations and companies the privileges of legal status
                        in France which had already been extended to nearly all the countries of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>You will notice that this privilege is only granted to such of the American
                        corporations “which have sought and obtained in the United States the
                        authorization of the government.”</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that this restriction will only be nominal; it is rendered
                        necessary by the law under which the decree is issued, and is attached to
                        all similar grants. But as the French courts have decided that foreign
                        corporations established by authority of the laws of their respective
                        countries, and which have complied with the conditions imposed upon them by
                        said laws, are to be considered as having obtained the authorization of
                        their government, the American corporations have all reason to expect that
                        their legal status will be hereafter fully recognized in France.</p>
                    <p>It gives me pleasure to add that the advantage just now secured to American
                        interests is entirely due to Mr. Morton. It is through his personal
                        relations with the cabinet officers and other legal functionaries who have
                        had the matter in charge that we have succeeded in obtaining aresult which

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge your
                        instruction No. 301, of the 8th instant, received this day, inclosing a
                        complaint of Messrs. William Archdeacon &amp; Co., to the Department of
                        State, that the importation of American pork had been prohibited in Germany,
                        and that they are thus prevented from bringing into Germany 100 barrels of
                        pigs’ tongues which they have shipped to Altona, and directing me to call
                        the attention of the foreign office to the matter.</p>
                    <p>In reply I have the honor to state that this prohibition of the importation
                            <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0230"/>of pork is not new, but dates
                        back to June, 1880. On the 29th June, 1880, Mr. White informed the
                        Department by telegram, as also in dispatch No. 136, of the prohibition by
                        imperial eecree of the 25th of June, 1880, of the admission of all kinds of
                        pork except hams and sides of bacon, and inclosing a copy with translation
                        of the decree. Mr. White at the same time stated that in an interview with
                        Mr. Von Hoffman he had ascertained that the reason of the prohibition was
                        that trichinæ could not be easily detected except in these two forms of
                        pork.</p>
                    <p>From the special mention of hams and bacon in the decree, I have no doubt
                        that tongues are included in the category of forbidden forms of pigs’ flesh,
                        but I will, in accordance with your instruction, address the foreign office
                        on the subject, and ascertain whether there is any special exemption for
                        pigs’ tongues, and in case there is not, whether it would be possible to
                        pass this one shipment of Messrs. Archdeacon &amp; Co., after a rigid
                        inspection to insure the pigs’ tongues being in a fit condition for
                        food.</p>
                    <p>I would also state in this connection that in December, 1880, Messrs. Armor
                        &amp; Co., of Chicago, the largest pork packers in the world, addressed
                        &amp; similar complaint to this legation that they were debarred by the
                        above-mentioned decree from exporting their canned brawn to Germany, and
                        they claimed that this particular preparation of pork was safe from the
                        danger of trichinæ as it had been subjected to a temperature of 250°
                        Fahrenheit, a certificate of which could be sent with each shipment. They
                        were advised, in reply, to lay their case before the Department of State,
                        which would then instruct the legation to intervene in the matter if it
                        should be thought best. I trust that I shall not be exceeding my
                        instructions if I include Messrs. Armor &amp; Co.’s grievances with those of
                        Messrs. Archdeacon &amp; Co. in my note to the foreign office.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0231"/>Count Hatzfeldt, provisional secretary
                            of state for foreign affairs, to the subject of customs duties on
                            articles of food from the United States coming into Germany.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned would respectfully represent to his excellency that the
                            American Government is informed by the reports of its consuls as well as
                            by the complaints of individual exporters, that articles of food, such
                            as beef in cans, hams in cloth covers, and salt fish in wooden boxes,
                            are not allowed by Germany to pay duties, as in other countries, under
                            the class of imports to which they belong, but are taxed by weight under
                            the class of material of which the boxes in which they are packed are
                            made. For instance, canned beef, instead of paying a duty of 12 marks
                            per 100 R—according to No. 25 <hi rend="italic">g</hi>, 1, of the
                            official tariff of July 15, 1879, is taxed at 24 marks per 100 R—as
                            ironware under No. 6, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, 3, B, because it is
                            packed in tinned iron cans, and iron bears a higher rate of duty than
                            beef. Likewise dried salt fish, instead of coming in as fish, because it
                            is packed in wooden boxes like Swedish matches, pays as <hi
                                rend="italic">wood</hi>, a much higher duty. It further appears that
                            if the cans have no labels, the lower duty on beef is charged.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, after a careful study of the tariff laws, fails to
                            understand such an interpretation of them by the officers of customs,
                            especially, as by a treasury order of the 23d January, 1882, Mr. Krüger,
                            a collector at Altona, is informed that the nature of the covering is
                            not to affect the duty rate of goods. Notwithstanding this order, the
                            legation is informed that at Hamburg, American beef is still taxed as
                            ironware because the iron cans are packed, simply for the purpose of
                            transportation, in large wooden cases. It is surely superfluous,
                            however, to remark that the beef is the only really dutiable article in
                            this instance, as it is shipped as beef in invoices and bills of lading,
                            and sold as beef both wholesale and retail, sometimes even without the
                            cans, by the slice.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned trusts that the imperial finance ministry will, when
                            their attention is called to it, see the injustice of taxing these
                            nourishing and cheap articles of food under the class of material which
                            does not in any way enter into their composition, and only serves to
                            protect them during transportation, just as the ship protects them on
                            the sea, or the railway wagon on land.</p>
                        <p>It would also appear to be an error to tax them, as so much <hi
                                rend="italic">weight</hi> of iron or wood, as the principal weight
                            is not in the iron cases, but in the beef. Therefore, if the iron and
                            wood must be taxed, it would seem to be more correct to tax them by
                            their own weight separate from the beef or fish, and in addition to the
                            tax on the beef or fish taken by themselves, which latter could even be
                            increased if necessary.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, in the hope that his excellency will give this matter
                            his early attention, and endeavor to meet the apparently reasonable
                            complaint of the importers, avails himself of this occasion to renew to
                            his excellency the assurances of his most distinguished

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is a fact worthy of note that there is at
                        present an entire accord between the various European powers upon a somewhat
                        annoying phase of the troublesome and often recurring Eastern question.</p>
                    <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0232"/>
                    <p>Even the cabinets of Berlin and Paris seem to be in harmony upon the
                        principles to be applied to the settlement of the difficulty between the
                        Khedive and the rebellious Egyptian troops and agitators. While M. de
                        Freycinet declares in the Chamber of Deputies, that France will act in
                        accord with the remainder of Europe upon this question, and “accept the
                        responsibilities, decisions, and means of action of the European concert,”
                        it is stated on apparently good authority that Prince Bismarck is favorably
                        impressed with these declarations, and confirmed in his desire to give his
                        moral support to the present French Government, and save it from troubles
                        likely to bring about its fall, which would return Gambetta to power, whose
                        name is correctly or otherwise synonymous with a policy of restlessness and
                        adventure.</p>
                    <p>But the action of Germany in this crisis seems to be rather one of
                        observation and caution, than of direction. England and France are
                        cautiously taking joint measures to influence the Porte and control the
                        situation in Egypt. But as far as I can observe, Germany has not given
                        anything more than an implied assent to the measures in question. I am
                        inclined to believe that this arises more from a desire to avoid the
                        expenses of naval and military movements than from a diverse view of the
                        situation, but partly from a wish to avoid a concurrent military movement
                        with France.</p>
                    <p>It may apparently be safely asserted that there is everything in the attitude
                        of the European powers towards each other, and in their respective
                        interests, to guarantee that no disagreement will arise over this new
                        development of the Eastern question to lead to any war among themselves or
                        either of them.</p>
                    <p>The German press seem to recognize in the utterances of the French executive
                        a peaceful policy at the expense of French traditions concerning Egypt. The
                        Kreuz Zeitung seems surprised at the unusual self-control of the French, far
                        greater than they are usually credited as having, and says: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The policy of M. de Freycinct is sensible, and takes account of
                                existing circumstances, but it is certainly not French. The
                                traditional policy of France in Egypt has just received a harder
                                blow than has for a long time been inflicted anywhere on national
                                prestige. There is no doubt that at the present time Turkey is, more
                                than the Western powers, the protector of Egypt, while the lowest
                                authority in that regard is that of France.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>While these views are tinged with prejudice toward France, and do not do
                        justice to its attitude in this affair, they imply at least German
                        satisfaction with the situation. The National Zeitung speaks of Mr. de
                        Freycinct’s declarations as proving— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The predominance of peaceful ideas in France, and the powerlessness
                                of the foes of peace in Europe, whose avowed and restless chief is
                                Mr. Gambetta, as now appears more clearly than ever.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>It thinks France will be safer with European concurrence than in isolation
                        with England, in that bitter quarrels would probably arise between France
                        and England over Egyptian matters if they should attempt to jointly effect
                        the necessary settlement there.</p>
                    <p>If there is a slight tone of jealous distrust of France, mingled with that of
                        approbation, in these utterances, perhaps it is that Germany will not forget
                        that, in the language of Von Moltke, it must be prepared for fifty years to
                        defend its acquisitions in the Franco-Prussian war, and cannot be wholly
                        cordial to a possibly prospective foe.</p>
                    <p>But it seems probable, in view of all the surroundings, that even if warlike
                        movements occur in Egypt, or a conflict there, to put down the soldiery
                        which imperil the lives of the Khedive and European residents, <pb n="161"
                            xml:id="pg_161" facs="0233"/>and to terminate the existence of the
                        military party headed by Arabi, that such events will not change the
                        peaceful situation in Europe. On the surface, at least, there is promise
                        here of continued peace.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the Reichstag
                        will to-day terminate its labors for the present, and will, with the
                        concurrence of the government, adjourn until the 31st of November next this
                        extra session, the second of the fifth legislative period. The season was so
                        far advanced that it seemed quite improbable that the parliamentary work on
                        hand could be disposed of without adjournment; so long an adjournment is
                        unprecedented, the adjournment heretofore having been ordinary parliamentary
                        ones, not exceeding thirty days; but the present course was adopted to save
                        and utilize the laborious and important work already accomplished in the
                        various committees, which it would have been necessary to begin afresh at a
                        new session had the present one been formally closed.</p>
                    <p>The Reichstag was convened in extra session by the Emperor for the 27th of
                        April last. In a speech delivered at that session (a copy and translation of
                        which were at the time furnished to the Department by this legation) the
                        same measures were submitted for consideration that had been recommended
                        from the throne at the opening (on November 17 last) of the previous
                        session. That previous session had proven barren of positive results. The
                        part of the session which has closed to-day has accomplished little more in
                        the direction desired by the government.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The principal government measures undisposed of, and remaining in the hands
                        of the various committees for consideration and action at the next meeting
                        of the Reichstag, are a measure proposed for the insurance of workingmen
                        against accidents on the basis of a corporation and cooperative organization
                        of the various industries, this measure having been intended to take the
                        place of the “government insurance bill” (heretofore transmitted to the
                        department with a translation), which was withdrawn on account of the
                        violent opposition it provoked in parliamentary debates last winter. Again,
                        a measure for “health insurance,” with compulsory participation of the
                        industrial classes against the results of illness; and, finally, a measure
                        revising the trade laws. Upon the fate of the bills above referred to I may
                        have the honor to report hereafter.</p>
                    <p>The grand measure submitted for legislative action by the government, a
                        measure which the prince chancellor has pronounced to be the corner-stone of
                        his “tax reform policy,” and his “final ideal,” was the “tobacco monopoly
                        bill,” which has just met with a final and overwhelming defeat; the vote
                        standing 276 to 43, twelve members not voting.</p>
                    <p>After having been rejected by the advisory body, the “economic council”
                        (described in Mr. White’s dispatch, No. 188), by the body of scientists and
                        experts but recently instituted to pass upon the propriety <pb n="162"
                            xml:id="pg_162" facs="0234"/>and expediency, from a scientific point of
                        view, of submitting for legislative action a contemplated measure, it had
                        also been emphatically rejected by committee of the Reichstag, to whom it
                        had been referred, to be finally defeated in its second reading in the
                        Reichstag itself, in the conclusive manner above stated.</p>
                    <p>As announced at the opening of the Reichstag, this bill was designed to make
                        possible an end much needed, viz, a tax reform that should enable the
                        Imperial Government to dispense with the matricular contributions of the
                        individual confederated states constituting the Empire, thus putting it in
                        the power of those states to relieve their respective parishes, and other
                        communal associations, from what is denounced as burdensome and unequal <hi
                            rend="italic">direct</hi> taxation.</p>
                    <p>In this connection it may be remarked that the Prussion legislature rejected,
                        at its recent session, a bill disposing of the savings to accrue as
                        Prussia’s share of the benefits to be derived from the proposed “tax
                        reform,” on the ground, probably, that it would be safer to await the
                        reform.</p>
                    <p>The “tobacco monopoly” is deemed by the government the one object of indirect
                        taxation which will yield a sufficiency for the purpose in view. If the
                        government estimates be reliable, a very rich harvest is to be expected from
                        such a measure. The monopoly has, however, met with violent and persistent,
                        and, as the sequel shows, effective opposition, not only on the ground of
                        the socialistic principle it involves, and that its opponents consider it as
                        being generally inexpedient, but also on the ground that it is a financial
                        blunder, the correctness of the calculations on which the expected enormous
                        yield was based having been pronounced by many of the ablest economists as
                        erroneous to such a degree as to make the hoped-for result wholly
                        illusory.</p>
                    <p>Institutions similar to the “tobacco monopoly” measure proposed for this
                        Empire existing already in various states of continental Europe, and
                        especially in the great states of France, Austro Hungary, and Italy, I shall
                        not attempt to submit a detailed statement of the measure; but shall confine
                        this paper to some comments of a general nature, and to a presentation of
                        the statistics on the subject, inclosing for the files of the Department for
                        future reference, if desired, the bill itself, embracing seventy-two
                        paragraphs, together with the “motive and estimates,” as well as the very
                        lengthy speeches, occupying several hours in the delivery, of the 12th and
                        14th instant, of the chancellor, as also the speech of Mr. Von Bennigsen
                        against the bill. In view of the pressure of more urgent work at this
                        legation at this time, it has not been found practicable to transmit
                        translations of the voluminous printed matter inclosed.</p>
                    <p>As to the estimates on which the bill, is based:</p>
                    <p>The entire quantity of tobacco to be manufactured is estimated at 1,505,720
                        cwt. (the pound being about one-tenth heavier than the English pound), of
                        which 587,528 cwt. are for cigars; 74,985,680 cwt. for smoking; 12,242,560
                        cwt. for snuff, and 4,590,960 cwt. for chewing tobacco; viz, about 828,146
                        tons (English) in all. It is estimated that-over three-fifths of this
                        amount, owing to the increased encouragement to be given to planting in
                        Germany, would be of domestic growth; whereas domestic tobacco has hitherto
                        only figured to the extent of only one-third of the quantity manufactured.
                        This, of course, presupposes a falling off in the demand for American and
                        other foreign tobacco.</p>
                    <p>The total cost of purchase is estimated at 82,599,210 marks; the cost of the
                        foreign tobacco being 60,686,270 marks; that of domestic, 21,912,940 marks.
                        The total wages to be paid are estimated at 47,996,795 <pb n="163"
                            xml:id="pg_163" facs="0235"/>marks, the calculation being based on the
                        average wages paid at the imperial tobacco factory at Strasburg, as is also
                        the estimate of 18,890,638 marks for cans, bottles, paper wraps, &amp;c.,
                        and the estimate of 16,379,565 marks for ingredients used other than
                        tobacco.</p>
                    <p>The estimated receipts from the sale of the entire manufactured article are
                        347,770,442 marks, viz: From cigars, 280,413,947; from smoking tobacco,
                        67,187,169; from snuff, 15,548,051; from chewing tobacco, 8,378,502; from
                        cigarettes, 1,011,780; from imported cigars, 16,030,875 marks. The entire
                        expenses of manufacture being estimated at 173,174,775 marks, a profit of
                        174,595,667 marks results, which, after deducting the interest, 10,922,500
                        marks, being 4¼ per cent of 257,000,000 marks—the estimated amount of the
                        indemnities to be paid under the bill to persons engaged in the tobacco
                        business—there remains the net annual profit of 163,673,167 marks, or, in
                        round numbers, about $89000,000.</p>
                    <p>It is argued with great force by excellent authority that many of the data
                        furnished by the government are highly fallacious. For instance, that its
                        promise to employ in the service of the monopoly 80,000 persons, and to
                        grant indemnities to 8,000 persons would be quite impracticable and
                        inconsistent with the end in view—that of obtaining the large hoped-for
                        revenue. This promise, it is urged, must necessarily be based on the
                        assumption that there are just 88,000 persons engaged in the tobacco
                        industry—an assumption not borne out by facts, since the tobacco
                        investigating committee found in 1877 that 99,714 were employed in the
                        factories alone, and the additional number of 22,301 persons engaged in
                        working on the article at home, making a total of 122,015. What is to become
                        of the remaining 32,000 persons? They would be without bread from the
                        outset. Nor could the government hope to employ anything like the number
                        proposed. The monopoly in France employs only some 18,000 persons.
                        Ultimately the monopoly must render useless to many thousands of Germans
                        their only weapons in the struggle of life—their knowledge of their
                        business; while the pitiful indemnity awarded would soon be consumed in
                        enforced idleness or, worse still, lost in enterprises of which they knew
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>Just calculations, contended the opponents of the measure, would show the
                        estimated consumption of 388,000,000 to be excessive by 128,000,000 at
                        least. The expenditure to be incurred was, on the other hand,
                        under-estimated. Operatives, according to the bill, were to receive an
                        average weekly remuneration of eleven marks (about $2.60), the licensed
                        sellers an annual income of 646 marks (about $150.) The administration would
                        soon find that it would have to reckon with very different figures for wages
                        and salaries. In connection with the prophecy that the monopoly would soon
                        find itself working with a deficit; violent political opponents of the
                        chancellor also contended that the host of workmen and licensed vendors to
                        be employed, some 140,000 persons, would nevertheless be retained in service
                        to swell, as employés of the government, its already vast army of
                        dependents, and to furnish convenient material with which to fill at
                        elections the seats of the Reich tag with conservative members, in order
                        that the evils of the monopoly might be perpetuated and other government
                        measures be carried.</p>
                    <p>I will state, in conclusion, that the Reichtag followed the rejection of the
                        “monopoly bill” by the adoption of a resolution declaring that the tobacco
                        interest should be let alone, and that an increase of taxation on that
                        article is called for.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your instruction, No. 9, of the
                        31st ultimo, I have the honor to state that in my judgment the
                        “Boisseliercase,” which employed so many reams of paper, is definitely
                        closed by the recent action of the German authorities in issuing discharges
                        from citizenship to the brothers, as stated in my dispatch No. 23 of the 7th
                        instant. I have now, however, a communication (copy inclosed) from
                        Boisselier <hi rend="italic">pére</hi>, to whose care I sent the documents
                        referred to, that he might communicate them to his sons, wherein he objects
                        to this proceeding of the German authorities as unauthorized, in that the
                        young men had never applied for discharge from Prussian allegiance because
                        they are native-born citizens of the United States, at the same time
                        referring to me for an opinion whether the status of the young men would be
                        impaired by accepting these discharges from an allegiance which they never
                        owed or professed.</p>
                    <p>The accompanying “condensed statement,” which is a correct recapitulation of
                        the facts and several steps in the case taken by the American and German
                        Governments, and unnecessary to transmit, dwells upon the fact that the
                        father is a naturalized citizen of the United States, although residing in
                        Germany continuously since his naturalization for over a quarter of a
                        century.</p>
                    <p>In my reply to him (a copy of which is inclosed) I give to him my opinion
                        that the matter will now rest, that the form of closing the case by the
                        German authorities is immaterial, and resembles their mode of remitting an
                        unjust fine levied upon youths who have emigrated to America and become
                        American citizens, and do not appear, upon summons for military service,
                        which remission is only by pardon from the Emperor.</p>
                    <p>Objection might be taken to such pardon on the ground that it assumes an
                        offense where there was none in fact. But the essential is the effectual
                        quittance of any claim, not the form by which it is manifested.</p>
                    <p>I also call his attention to the fact that it would perhaps be as well to
                        accept this solution of a long standing controversy, as it is practically
                        sufficient, because unnecessary pressure might invite the authorities to
                        examine his own claims to be considered an American citizen, after so long
                        residence here, in view that the treaty fixes the limit of two years as that
                        wherein the presumption of an intention to return to America shall
                        prevail.</p>
                    <p>While holding that the rights of the sons are not affected by these
                        considerations, in that they exercised their right to choose to be American
                        citizens as soon as they had escaped the parental control which had kept
                        them in Germany since infancy, and had gone to America and in good faith
                        cast their lot with the land of their birth, and that I should deem it my
                        duty to use the influence of the American Government to protect them should
                        these discharges not be final, or other trouble at any time arise, yet he
                        might consider, whether in his own case, it might be considered by the
                        American Government that such a lapse of time, during which he had
                        personally avoided discharging any obligations of citizenship towards the
                        United States, had weakened its interest in and right to claim him as one of
                        its citizens.</p>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0237"/>
                    <p>In this connection, and because it illustrates the position which I have
                        taken in this letter as to the claims of the Boisselier brothers to
                        citizenship and protection, even if the rights of the father are more
                        doubtful, and also that I may have the advantage of any suggestions from the
                        Department on the general subject, if it deems me in error, I beg leave to
                        inclose a copy of an answer made by me on the 16th instant, to a dispatch of
                        Count Hatzfeldt, asking in an analogous case at what period, from the
                        American point of view, did the American citizenship of two brothers
                        commence who were born of unnaturalized parents in America, and were brought
                        here during infancy and kept here during minority, but who claimed American
                        citizenship when they arrived at military age, the father having become
                        naturalized after their birth, and then removing to and residing with them
                        in Germany. Although I may have occasion hereafter to inclose this whole
                        correspondence in the Oppenheimer brothers’ case, to which it belongs, when
                        that case is terminated, I beg leave to submit this part of it as an exhibit
                        in the present case for convenience of comparison.</p>
                    <p>Count Hatzfeldt asks if these sons became citizens by virtue of their birth
                        of unnaturalized parents in America or by virtue of the naturalization of
                        the father subsequent to their births.</p>
                    <p>I reply that by the laws of the United States it is provided that children of
                        persons who have been duly naturalized under its laws, being under the age
                        of twenty-one years at the time of the naturalization of their parents, are
                        citizens of the United States, if dwelling there; that these brothers are
                        such citizens by the fact of the naturalization of their parents, they then
                        being minors, and then living with their parents in the United States. But I
                        call his attention to other elements of consideration in their cases. Having
                        been born in the United States of parents of German origin, they acquired by
                        that fact, even if the parents had never been naturalized, the right of
                        election of either American or German citizenship on arriving at maturity,
                        even if in the mean time, while under parental control, they had been
                        removed to Germany. By applying to the American legation in Germany for
                        passports, and taking the oath of allegiance prescribed for that purpose by
                        American law, these brothers clearly elected to be American citizens, and
                        thus exercised their birthright to be recognized as such, and are entitled
                        to the consideration and protection of the American Government. The exercise
                        of such right of election carried their citizenship, by the well-understood
                        law of relation, back to the date of their respective births.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I call the attention of the Department to the decision of
                        the Attorney-General of June 26, 1865, found on page 564, vol. 13, Foreign
                        Relations.</p>
                    <p>If I have called the attention of Boisselier<hi rend="italic">pére</hi> to
                        the possible considerations in his own case, as distinct from that of his
                        sons, I trust I may be pardoned from the fact that there are cases of
                        persons emigrating to the United States for the only purpose of procuring,
                        by a short, temporary residence, American naturalization; which secured,
                        they re-immigrate and live here for years, without purpose to return,
                        avoiding the performance of all obligations to the government of their
                        assumed choice, as well as to that of their birth. I have not found by
                        experience that these persons are the less peremptory or exacting in their
                        demands for ample recognition as Americans.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Coming home this morning, after a
                            fortnight’s absence, I found on my desk your esteemed favor of the 6th
                            instant, covering two documents of the Royal Prussian Government for my
                            sons: Richard Werner and Casper Rethard Boisselier.</p>
                        <p>Looking over these documents, I discovered that the contents of the same
                            is not in conformity with the true facts of the case, for it is stated
                                <hi rend="italic">that my sons applied for discharge from Prussian
                                allegiance</hi>, which they never did nor could have done, <hi
                                rend="italic">being native-born citizens of the United States of
                                America</hi>, and recognized as such by that government as well as
                            by Prussian judicial decision. (1 Please see inclosed copy 1.)</p>
                        <p>I imagine that these documents would not be fully satisfactory to my
                            sons, and therefore beg leave to return the same for your closer
                            examination.</p>
                        <p>In order that you may better understand this case, and trusting you will
                            not deem it obtrusive, I take liberty to send you, inclosed, several
                            documents relating to the matter, in connection with a condensed
                            statement of the case.</p>
                        <p>However, if after reading said papers, it appears to you <hi
                                rend="italic">that it would not impair my sons’ status as
                                native-born American citizens, to accept a discharge from an

                            politely request you to return the documents in question to me, that I
                            may be enabled to deliver the same into the hands of my sons as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your letter of the 20th instant, inclosing
                            a statement and sight documents relating to the case of your sons,
                            Richard and Casper, is received, and I have carefully examined all the
                            preceding correspondence in the matter.</p>
                        <p>It belongs to a class of which the legation has many cases in the course
                            of a year, where young men, whose fathers continually reside in Germany,
                            are summoned for military service, and where they fail to appear, and it
                            is shown that they are living elsewhere, the property of the father is
                            attached as security for a fine which has been imposed on the youths.
                            This fine cannot be collected, however, unless the estate is divided,
                            and in case that does not occur, the attachment expires by limitation in
                            about seven years.</p>
                        <p>Following some suggestions originally made in this case by Mr. Secretary
                            of State Evarts, and which it may be timely to repeat, it may be
                            remarked there might possibly be some reason in the views taken by the
                            German Government, inasmuch as you, the father, have resided in Germany
                            so many years after naturalization as to have incurred the risk, under
                            the Bancroft treaty, of having lost your American nationality, as well
                            as having involved your minor sons in the same loss. You were
                            naturalized in the United States, and after some years’ residence
                            returned to Germany with your infant sons in 1856, and have resided here
                            ever since, viz, twenty-six years. By the treaty it is provided that the
                            German Government may deem the residence of a naturalized citizen for
                            over two years as an abandonment of his American nationality. Thus the
                            treaty says:</p>
                        <p>“If a German naturalized in America renews his residence in Germany
                            without the intent to return to America, he shall be held to have
                            renounced his naturalization in the United States. * * * The intent not
                            to return may be held to exist when the person naturalized in one
                            country resides more than two years in the other.”</p>
                        <p>Though the German authorities have not taken the ground in your own case
                            that you shall be avowedly a German citizen or leave the country, it is
                            never too late for them to do so, and they would probably take such
                            steps if unnecessarily pressed in the matter. It might also be
                            considered by the American Government that such a lapse of time during
                            which you have personally avoided discharging any obligations of
                            citizenship towards the United States has weakened its interests in and
                            right to claim you as one of its citizens.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the case of your sons is somewhat different. They were
                            born in the United States, have never been German citizens, or sought to
                            become such. While minors, and under parental control they were brought
                            to this country and kept here independently of their own procurement.
                            When they became of age they exercised their <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167"
                                facs="0239"/>right to return to America and to choose American
                            citizenship, and have ever since conducted themselves as such, and in
                            perfect good faith. Their birth in the United States gave them the right
                            to assume American citizenship as soon as emancipated from parental
                            authority, and such assumption carried their citizenship by relation
                            back to the date of their birth.</p>
                        <p>As regards the special form of the discharge from Prussian allegiance, I
                            would say that this is the only official form the decision could take;
                            just as in the case of unjust or illegal fines paid or levied for
                            neglect of military service, the only efficient discharge is a <hi
                                rend="italic">pardon</hi> under the hand of the Emperor, even when
                            the individual is innocent and the authorities culpable. Your sons’
                            discharges appear to be made out on lithograph forms which were very
                            possibly prepared, for the cases of Schleswig citizens who had availed
                            themselves of their right to give up their Prussian citizenship after
                            the annexation of Schleswig Holstein, and which must be carried out
                            within six months.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that your sons will hear no more in the matter from the
                            authorities, and that their rights and honor as American citizens are in
                            no way compromised by these documents. But, in case they should be in
                            any way again molested, the legation stands willing and ready to use the
                            influence of the American Government for their protection. Your several
                            inclosures as stated are herewith returned; your statement being
                            retained.</p>

                            and is gratified to learn therefrom that the appropriate authorities
                            have been instructed to abstain from measures of force against the

                            relative to these cases, viz:</p>
                        <p>“For the purpose of this investigation of the relations as regards
                            nationality of the Oppenheimer brothers, it is requested that
                            information may be kindly furnished as to the point of time from which,
                            from the American point of view, the said brothers are regarded as
                            Americans, and in particular as to whether they have acquired North
                            American nationality through the fact of their birth within the
                            territory of the United States (at Washington, in 1857 and 1859),
                            notwithstanding the circumstance that their father had at that time not
                            yet become a naturalized citizen, or through the naturalization of their
                            father, in 1865.”</p>
                        <p>The undersigned takes pleasure in complying with the request of his
                            excellency as above quoted, and to state:</p>
                        <p>1st. That the brothers Oppenheimer were born in the United States of
                            German parents, who emigrated to the United States and became citizens
                            thereof in due course of time, but after the birth and durign the
                            minority of these sons.</p>
                        <p>By the laws of the United States it is provided that children of persons
                            who have been duly naturalized under its laws, being under the age of
                            twenty-one years at the time of the naturalization of their parents, are
                            citizens of the United States, if dwelling there.</p>
                        <p>These brothers are such citizens by the fact of the naturalization of
                            their parents, they then being minors and then living with their parents
                            in the United States.</p>
                        <p>2d. But it may be further stated that the cases of these brothers have
                            other elements for consideration. Having been born in the United States
                            of parents of German origin, they acquired by that fact, even if the
                            parents had never been naturalized, the right of election of either
                            American or German citizenship on arriving at majority, even if in the
                            mean time, while under parental control, they had been removed to
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>By applying to the American legation in Germany for passports, and taking
                            the oath of allegiance prescribed for the purpose by American law, these
                            brothers clearly elected to be American citizens, and thus exercised
                            their birthright to be recognized as such, and are entitled to the
                            consideration and protection of the American Government. The exercise of
                            such right of election carried their citizenship, by the well-understood
                            law of relation, back to the dates of their respective births.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, while he has thus the honor to furnish the information
                            requested, avails himself of this occasion to renew to his excellency
                            the assurance of his most distinguished consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Presuming that your correspondents from other
                        capitals keep you fully advised of the aspects of political and military
                        movements from their various standpoints, I beg to submit a few observations
                        upon the relations of these movements to Germany, perhaps furnishing a
                        somewhat wider range for induction.</p>
                    <p>From what I have observed and learned I am satisfied that the influence of
                        Germany has recently been exerted in the interest of peace in Egypt, and to
                        the end of satisfying England and France, through the action of the Sultan,
                        with whom the empire has preserved good relations, its object being to avoid
                        the possible effects of a military campaign by the western powers upon the
                        general tranquility. But these peaceful purposes of the empire bid fair to
                        be thwarted by the hesitations or craft of the Porte, which seeks to regain
                        its hold upon Egypt, and while watching for such advantage lets matters
                        drift into dangerous conditions. The resolute attitude of England during the
                        past week has apparently changed the views of the German Government, so that
                        it now has little hope that the solution can be reached through the Porte,
                        and it seems to sanction the resolution of England to vindicate its dignity
                        and rights by active military operations. Certainly, so far as appears,
                        there has been no protest by Germany against the obvious purpose of England.
                        On the other hand, it seems to adhere to the European concert, and not to
                        consider that the warlike intentions of England can prejudice it.</p>
                    <p>This policy of Germany seems actually to spring from its strength and
                        self-confidence. It contemplates any eventuality with composure. While its
                        interests would be promoted by peace it is superbly prepared for war. While
                        other European nations maintain great armies, and have well-stored
                        magazines, none equal Germany in acquired facilities to launch in any
                        desired direction the effective enginery of war.</p>
                    <p>This fact is being perceived by military authorities elsewhere, and is,
                        perhaps, the best guarantee that the peace of the empire will remain
                        undisturbed. On two sides only has Germany apparent occasion for
                        watchfulness—France and Russia.</p>
                    <p>In the former case there is an apparent feeling of concord between <pb
                            n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0241"/>the administration of M. de
                        Frecynet and the chancellor. Bat French politics are always uncertain, and
                        back of the present French executive there always looms up the shadow of
                        Gambetta, the <hi rend="italic">enfant terrible</hi> of the republic, to
                        German eyes. Mr. Gambetta is not chary of his views upon German subjects.
                        The Berlin papers are now discussing with various intonations a recent
                        speech of his before a parliamentary commission, where he is alleged to have
                        said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I believe that 400,000 old troops are better than 800,000 such as
                                this law will provide us; but the three years’ service is in harmony
                                with the present custom of our country. We must accept it. There is
                                a prospect of having a good army if we give it the most manly and
                                most intelligent element that we have. Reserves who only serve one
                                year would be inefficient. In order to cope with Prussia, we must
                                not only be equal, but superior to her. We were beaten, and are
                                therefore obliged to impose heavy sacrifices upon the country.
                                France pays one milliard for its army and navy, and must continue to
                                do so in order to defend its existence.</p>
                            <p>The spirit of conquest is at present greater in Europe than in the
                                fifteenth century, and is directed against us. To be or not to be is
                                now the question. I hope the French democracy will not be doomed to
                                these sacrifices perpetually, but now it is a question-of life or
                                death with us.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Such utterances from the powerful leader of a party in France, the possible
                        future President of the Republic, necessarily attract attention here.</p>
                    <p>Upon the side of Russia, unless the incident of the betrayal of the plan of
                        the Baltic defenses and torpedo stations to that government by a Prussian
                        naval officer is false, * * * there is also some reason for watchfulness.
                        The death of General Scobeleff does not entirely relieve the situation.</p>
                    <p>But German confidence in its ability to cope with any possible adversary, or
                        with several, does not seem unwarranted. On the occasion of the opening of
                        railway running through the city of Berlin, the National Zeitung, in a
                        leading article upon it, among other things said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The central depot in the Fredierich Strasse has now become a center
                                of great importance to German and Prussian power. If we regard the
                                zigzag lines diverging from it, we are forcibly reminded of the
                                thunderbolts darting from the hands of Jupiter to the right and
                                left.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The object of the road in question, which is extraordinary in its solidity
                        and facilities for handling bodies of men, is undoubtedly more military than
                        commercial. The above article attracted the attention of the French Revue
                        Militaire de I’Etranger, and it reviewed it, alleging that it emanates from
                        the “general staff,” and admits that the transportation of German troops has
                        been greatly facilitated by this railway connection.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>If it be true that six lines of road are already constructed in the
                            direction of Posen (says the writer in this review), for strategical
                            purposes, the lines leading to Breslau and to Eastern Prussia are no
                            less important. For some years already lines of railroad have been
                            projected through the province bordering on the Russian frontier, while
                            on the Russian side little or nothing has been done in this direction,
                            and consequently there are no facilities for concentrating large bodies
                            of troops in a short time, or even assuming an energetic offensive.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>This comparative statement of the relative facilities for handling troops of
                        Germany and Russia is quite accurate. Owing to the splendid system of
                        railways in Germany, that part of Poland situated on the left bank of the
                        Vistula, or perhaps the whole of that province, with the exception of the
                        fortified places, lies open to German invasion and occupation. It is even
                        possible that, owing to the inability of Russia to concentrate troops on the
                        Vistula in time, she would be forced to take up a position much farther in
                        land, in which case the German army would gain an advantage, the result of
                        which cannot be foreseen; an advantage which could not be reckoned by hours,
                        but by days.</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0242"/>
                    <p>The effect of this system of railways, of which the road through Berlin is
                        the completion and key, is to enable Germany to transport troops even from a
                        battle-field on her eastern or southern border to the west, or wherever
                        needed. That power doubles its forces which can rapidly handle them, and
                        concentrates them on new points. In the event of a war with a powerful
                        neighbor, if Germany were compelled to defend itself against another, or
                        possibly a simultaneous attack, it could make the most of its regular army
                        and reserves, and concentrate with crushing force first upon one and then
                        upon the other of its enemies, holding the one in check while destroying the
                        other. Her central position is favorable to this, and her railroad system
                        utilizes it.</p>
                    <p>It is important to notice that all these lines of German railroads extend
                        into the heart of Lorraine. They are ready for instant service against
                        France as well as Russia. They serve as good purpose on the side of Austria.
                        In the event of war with either of these powers, or with all of them, they
                        are inestimable.</p>
                    <p>The German papers are aware of the great advantages given by this railroad
                        system, and glory in it as a means of gaining inestimable time in a decisive
                        moment. The Berlin Tageblatt relates that in the campaign of 1866, at the
                        battle of Langensalza, it became imperatively necessary to throw as large a
                        force of troops from the interior as could be spared into Thuringia, to
                        intercept the Hanoverian army, and cut off its retreat toward the south.
                        Everything depended upon it. The Emperor personally urged men on furlough in
                        the streets of Berlin to join their commands, and lagging troops were
                        dispatched in special vans. The object was accomplished and the Hanoverian
                        army was captured. It instances a case where a rapid movement saved a great
                        battle in the Franco-Prussian war, and might have instanced Blucher’s timely
                        descent on the field at Waterloo. Most of Napoleon’s successes were gained
                        by his superior activity in concentrating his troops at unexpected points.
                        It would seem that Germany is acting upon Bismarck’s aphorism, that its
                        central position acts like a magnet to attract to it the bayonets of Europe,
                        and has created a system of rapid transportation for its troops and

                        circumference, vehemently and rapidly, where necessity or policy may
                        require.</p>
                    <p>In this view of its gigantic resources it is not difficult to see why it-is

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The resolute and rapid action of England in
                        Egypt seems to have taken Europe by surprise, and made that power complete
                        master of the situation. It was a vital question in the early summer if
                        England would be allowed by European public sentiment to adopt an aggressive
                        policy in dealing with Arabi Pasha and the military party in Egypt. The <pb
                            n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0243"/>press in several European capitals
                        was very hostile to English pretensions, and in places where it was conceded
                        that English interests and prestige would justify forcible intervention it
                        was declared that England would bluster and not fight. Such was the
                        prevailing tone of influential German newspapers, while those which usually
                        semi officially speak for the administration were remarkably silent. But
                        some information, which appeared to me reliable, tended to convince me that
                        England would act energetically, and would carry with it the tacit consent,
                        if not the expressed concurrence, of Germany; and I ventured to so predict
                        in my dispatches of that period, and that the remainder of Europe would
                        acquiesce.</p>
                    <p>The event seems fully to justify that view. England has acted in Egypt with
                        unusual celerity and decision, refusing the concurrence of the Porte except
                        on terms, and adopting the extremest measures—as the seizure of the Suez
                        Canal—to secure military results.</p>
                    <p>The effect of all this upon contemporary opinion is curious. The Italian
                        press, an uninfluential quantity, is fussily bitter. France has lost an
                        opportunity for co-operation and enhanced prestige. * * * The Republique
                        Française observes: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                of neglect. The British Cabinet will not fail to find excuses, and,
                                to be just, we must admit that it can invoke some very specious
                                ones.</p>

                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The German press, almost without exception, now acquiesces in the situation.
                        For some weeks past some newspapers here have sought by clamor to influence
                        the government to object to “British aggression” in Egypt, but these efforts
                        seem now to have ceased, in view of the continued success of English warlike
                        movements, though they would probably recommence if the tide of fortune
                        should change. As the matter now stands it may be said that Germany has
                        assumed the role of indifferent observer of Eastern events. Its asserted
                        friendship for Turkey has probably been severely tried by the
                        procrastinating and evasive policy of the latter power, making advice to it
                        of doubtful benefit, and the continued sympathy of a direct, positive man
                        like the chancellor, impossible.</p>
                    <p>It would seem that there is still nothing in the existing situation dangerous
                        to the general peace of Europe. It would be difficult to limit the questions
                        that may arise were England to prevail in Egypt to the extent contemplated
                        by its military preparations. French interests in the Mediterranean are
                        inconsistent with permanent English control of Egypt. Germany is not likely
                        to view with complacency any great accession of power by England or by any
                        other power within striking distance, and it will probably obstruct measures
                        looking to the ultimate humiliation of the Porte. Austria is but the second
                        of Germany in the diplomacy of this decade. Further, it is difficult to see
                        how England can treat Egypt as its sick man, and Europe permit it, and yet
                        object if Russia shall apply the same regimen to Turkey generally. Logic is
                        not always the prominent element of statesmanship, and consistency still
                        less, so much do circumstances dominate nations. Europe may not feel obliged
                        to consent to Russian aggression upon Turkey, even if it allows English
                        absorption of Egypt, though the moral force of objection would be weakened.
                        These questions and others, such as the mode and measure of English
                        pecuniary indemnity at the expense of Egypt, must speedily arise, and will
                        be more likely to disturb European tranquility than even the stirring events
                        now transpiring. The Kreuz Zeitung particularly represents the German
                        Government, and in a recent <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0244"/>article
                        gives evidence that the present quiescent attitude of Germany is only
                        provisional. This paper, after referring to the successes of the English
                        arms, expresses the opinion that the solution of the Egyptian question is
                        still far off. The relations between England and France, and between those
                        powers and the Porte, regarding the latter’s rights of sovereignty, are
                        still unsettled, and no agreement as to the so-called national question in
                        Egypt has been arrived at. It deems it impossible to foresee what aspect
                        these questions may assume in the future. Former differences are adjourned,
                        not settled. As the sovereignty of Turkey has been expressly recognized by
                        the conference at Constantinople, England could not disregard it, and the
                        national question in Egypt could only be discussed after Turkey had shown
                        what attitude she would take in presence of this movement.</p>
                    <p>The paper warned its readers not to see in the present situation the solution
                        of these questions, “for new difficulties will be unavoidable after the
                        English have finished their military operations.”</p>
                    <p>It is not difficult to read throughout this article a caveat served on the
                        English Government that the inaction of Germany does not mean a lack of
                        interest in the question whether England shall come out of these
                        difficulties an invincible Mediterranean power, and that the fate of Egypt
                        and Turkey is still a matter with which the Eastern nations have
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps as significant is the remark that the national question is in
                        abeyance in Egypt. Arabi assumes to represent a national party, if Germany
                        and other Eastern powers shall hereafter seek to maintain Arabi’s cause,
                        they cannot abandon Arabi to the vengeance of the English. Unless England
                        feels able to maintain itself against all Europe, it may find its victories
                        barren of results.</p>
                    <p>I venture to say that the policy of cabinets to yield to measures for the
                        present is not popular in any European state, and especially in Germany. I
                        could give you many evidences of this were it not to too much lengthen this
                        dispatch. But such a state of public feeling makes more probable action
                        restrictive of English designs hereafter.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is sufficiently long after the decisive
                        victory of the English at Tel-el Kebir in Egypt, and the suppression of the
                        rebellion against the Khedive, to form some judgment of the effect of these
                        results upon current opinion in Europe. So far as Egypt is concerned, it
                        appears to be demonstrated that the so-called “National Party,” of which
                        Arabi Bey was said to be the leader, had no existence. The natives there
                        have hailed the Khedive, restored by British arms, with demonstrations of
                        delight similar to those by which they hailed his overthrow.</p>
                    <p>It seems a matter of little moment to them which side wins so long as there
                        is excitement. The officials who groveled to Arabi now grovel to Tewfik.
                        This spectacle of official and popular flexibility has gone <pb n="173"
                            xml:id="pg_173" facs="0245"/>far to silence those who held that Arabi
                        was the representative of a party struggling for a higher national life, and
                        seems to demonstrate to them that it is safe to apply the ordinary rules of
                        human nature, and disregard ideas of irreconcilable fanaticisim on the part
                        of the Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>These considerations have removed one ground of sympathy for Egypt, and
                        lightened the difficulties in the way of England restoring peace and giving
                        a stable administration to Egypt. There being no native element out of
                        which, unassisted, such an administration can be constructed, it seems
                        natural that Europe should allow England, which speaks with the logic of
                        accomplished facts, to have freer scope in creating a permanent peace.</p>
                    <p>But other causes tend to the same end. Despite the hostility of a part of the
                        European press, there are too many interests involved for most of the
                        governments for these to wish to thwart this consummation. Many of the
                        subjects of each government have a stake in Egypt. England has these motives
                        in common with the rest of Europe, and had two others, viz: That the Suez
                        Canal be open to it at all times, and that no power capable of becoming
                        detrimental to its position on the Mediterranean be established at
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons it singly fought the fight which is now more and more
                        admitted to have been in the interest of Europe. Had defeat instead of
                        prompt and brilliant victory, attended its efforts, the harmony of opinion
                        in its favor would probably have been less.</p>
                    <p>Statements have recently been made, with some confidence, that Germany is
                        ready to form an understanding with England on the basis of its countenance
                        of a permanent English occupation of Egypt. This would involve a new
                        grouping of European powers; at least less reliance by England on her
                        traditional alliance with France, and a more cordial co-operation and
                        alliance with the German powers. Germany, it is suggested, would indirectly
                        gain by greater isolation of France; while England might thus show its
                        estimate of a connection that left it in the lurch at the first moment that
                        a strain was put upon it.</p>
                    <p>The Kreuz Zeitung, the presumed organ of the chancellor, takes pains to deny
                        that any advance towards such an understanding has been made by Germany,
                        although it had just previously published articles strongly advocating the
                        closer co-operation of England and Germany in the work of reorganizing Egypt
                        on the basis of altered circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the only value of the discussion, whatever the fact, is to show that
                        there is less disposition in this powerful center of influence to prevent
                        England from obtaining its full measure of future security in Egypt than at
                        one time seemed probable. But there may be external causes for this. The aim
                        of those in France who wish a strong foreign policy for that country, and
                        who were overruled by a refusal of the French Chambers to vote the credit
                        that should enable France to send a force to Egypt to co-operate with
                        England, is to preserve the Anglo-French control in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Strenuous efforts are being made by such French influences to persuade
                        England to moderation, and to further concord with the French in managing
                        Egyptian affairs.</p>
                    <p>The proposition has less force than if French ships had aided to bombard
                        Alexandria, and French troops had touched elbows with the English at the
                        assault of the fortifications of Tel-el-Kebir. Astute politicians may see in
                        the recent history elements of divergence between these two powers, in which
                        the one may not readily concede to the other a re-establishment of ante war
                        conditions. It is natural to assume that Germany may feel drawn nearer to
                        England in such event, or may <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0246"/>even
                        actively encourage a state of things that would lead to a rupture of the
                        French-English concord. My conclusions upon the latter point are more drawn
                        from the recent history of Europe and observations of the general tendency
                        of European politics, than from special information.</p>
                    <p>I beg leave to add that the recent policy of England, and its prompt and
                        effective military operations, have not only enhanced its real power in the
                        Mediterranean, but vindicated it from the suspicion some time entertained
                        that it would retreat from a conflict like that through which it has just
                        passed, rather than make good any threats to enforce its demands by war. It
                        has engaged in a great enterprise for the protection of its interest and the
                        honor of its flag, and has shrunk from no sacrifice to attain its
                        object.</p>

                    <p>But in this Egyptian emergency, England disregarded the refusal of its
                        associate to co-operate in putting down anarchy in Egypt, and without
                        waiting for the express concurrence of the Eastern powers, gallantly urged
                        the fight with its single resources, while holding the Porte, and perhaps
                        the Eastern powers, quiet by its able diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>It is not a matter of suprise that a strong government like Germany should
                        recognize such strong policy, and give its respect to its authors as well as
                        its implied assent thereto.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At my request, the second secretary of
                        legation, Mr. Chapman Coleman, has prepared a report upon the organization
                        of the courts of law in Germany, which I have the honor to inclose.</p>
                    <p>This report is very complete, and great pains have been taken by its author
                        to insure its accuracy. I doubt not it will be of permanent value to the
                        files of the Department; and, if published, will be of use to the legal
                        profession, as furnishing a means of comparison between the diverse judicial
                        systems of the United States and of the State governments, many of which are
                        in continual process of change. While this report shows some curious
                        features of legal administration, it may also be found that the German
                        system of courts as herein shown contains some valuable and suggestive
                        peculiarities.</p>
                    <p>The report is founded not only upon information derived from eminent German
                        lawyers and judges, but also on that obtained by a conscientious examination
                        of the laws relating to the subject, a task for which Mr. Coleman is
                        exceptionally well qualified.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit herewith,
                            pursuant to your request, a report upon the organization of the courts
                            of law in Germany.</p>
                        <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>This report is based upon the law of January 27, 1877, organizing the
                            courts of the Empire. This law is the first of a series of four laws,
                            enacted in the months of January and February, 1877, known collectively
                            as the judicial laws, and consisting of the law above referred to, of
                            the code of civil procedure, of that of criminal procedure, and of the
                            bankruptcy code. The codes enumerated and other laws will be treated of
                            in this report only in so far as references in the law under
                            consideration constitute portions of them a part of that law. The entire
                            body of the judicial laws, with the introductory enactments, and those
                            carrying them into effect, constitute a mass of material quite too
                            voluminous and complex for the scope of this report. Other portions of
                            those laws, and especially the code of civil procedure, greatly merit
                            the attention of foreign students, and might perhaps, hereafter, be
                            advantageously made the subject of further reports.</p>
                        <p>At as early a date as May, 1870, the re-established German Empire could
                            boast of the accomplishment of unification in the penal code; and a
                            codification of civil laws for the empire has long been under
                            preparation in the hands of the most eminent jurists of the country, and
                            will, in a few years, have been completed, and a result have been
                            attained that may well be regarded as grand, in view of the diversity of
                            systems pre-existing in the various states constituting the present
                            empire, and also in view of the youth of the empire.</p>
                        <p>I am assured by Baron von Diepenbroick Grüter, a judge of high authority,
                            until recently a member of the court of supreme jurisdiction in this
                            kingdom, and a gentleman to whom I am indebted for many valuable
                            suggestions bearing upon the subject of this report, that most marked
                            benefits have already resulted from this unification, in the avoidance
                            of interstate conflicts of law-evils sufficiently to be deplored in our
                            own country, arising out of the divers systems. Salutary results had
                            also ensued from new features, from improvements, embodied in the new
                            system, into which a new spirit seemed to have been infused since
                            unification.</p>
                        <p>Trusting the foregoing introductory remarks upon the German judicial laws
                            in general may not have been inappropriate in connection with this
                            report, I shall hereinafter confine myself to the discussion of the
                            organization of the German courts, of the regular, ordinary machinery
                            for the administration of justice in this country.</p>
                        <p>There is a number of other courts provided for by imperial
                            legislation—courts of peculiar, limited jurisdiction—which will receive
                            no further consideration here. I shall, however, in a final chapter,
                            endeavor to present the leading features of a system of arbitration
                            provided for by the code of civil procedure, for the purpose of
                            compromising contentions, and thereby avoiding recourse to the courts of
                            law.</p>

                        <p>Candidates for judicial offices must pass two examinations. Three years’
                            study of jurisprudence at an university, one half of this period at a
                            German university, must precede the first examination, which, in
                            Prussia, takes place before one of six specified superior land courts.
                            The examination is verbal and in writing. Its subjects are the
                            principles of public and private law, as well as those which underlie
                            statesmanship. The examination must show the positive knowledge of the
                            candidate, his insight into the nature and historical development of
                            legal relations, as also whether he has acquired for his future
                            avocation the requisite general knowledge of law and state craft. In
                            case of failure the examination may be repeated once, after an interval
                            of at least six months. This examination passed, the candidate acquires
                            the right to the title of “referendarius,” which is conferred upon him
                            by the president of that superior land court to which he applies for
                            employment and before whom he takes the oath of office.</p>
                        <p>Between the first and second examinations an interval of four years must
                            elapse, which period is employed in service with the courts and with
                            attorneys-at-law, and may be spent in part with a state attorney. The
                            occupation furnished the referendarius during this period of preparation
                            is such that he acquires in all the branches of business that appertains
                            to the office of a judge, of a state attorney, of a lawyer and notary,
                            that insight and practical skill which are requisite for the
                            administration of those offices. The referendarius may perform the
                            functions of a court clerk. After having been engaged for at least two
                            years in preparatory service, in case of need, he may be assigned, by
                            the department of justice, to the temporary conduct of judicial
                            business. The amts-judge, to whom superintendence over his preparatory
                            work has been <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0248"/>confided, may
                            also, under like conditions, intrust to him the management of particular
                            judicial affairs, and he may also be intrusted with the business of the
                            amts-attorney. A referendarius is not qualified to perform certain
                            important acts. In particular is he incompetent to pronounce judgment.
                            He may, however, be empowered to act as substitute for an
                            attorney-at-law temporarily prevented from fulfilling a professional
                            duty.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">THE SECOND EXAMINATION</hi>.</p>
                        <p>After the expiration of the preparatory period of four years, the
                            referendarius is admitted to the second—the great state examination—if
                            it appear from the testimonials as to his employment that he may be
                            regarded as qualified for the ordeal. In Prussia this examination takes
                            place before the judiciary examination committee, at Berlin, appointed
                            for such purpose for the entire kingdom. This second examination, as in
                            the case of the first, must be of an essentially practical character.
                            Its end is to ascertain whether the candidate has acquired a thorough
                            knowledge of the law, common, public, and private, which obtains in the
                            country, and whether he may be regarded as qualified to assume with
                            success an independent position in the judicial service.</p>
                        <p>In case of failure this examination may be repeated, once only however,
                            after an interval of at least nine months.</p>
                        <p>This second examination passed, the referendarius receives from the
                            minister of justice the title of court assessor, and is then qualified
                            to become a judge. Appointments to vacancies in judicial offices (in the
                            amts-courts) are made from a list of assessors arranged according to the
                            date of the acquisition of the title. The assessor has not long to wait
                            for an appointment if he announces himself, as the phrase goes, “at
                            disposal,” that is to say, announces his willingness to assume the
                            duties of an amts-judge <hi rend="italic">at any place</hi>. Pending an
                            appointment as judge the assessor is assigned for unsalaried employment
                            to an amts or land court. A transference can only take place with his
                            consent. He is, however, obliged, upon the direction of the minister of
                            justice, to assume temporarily the duties of an amts-judge, of an
                            assistant judge, or of an assistant in the office of a states attorney,
                            returning after the performance of such duty to that court or state
                            attorney’s office to which he was before assigned.</p>
                        <p>It is here remarked that the office of judge is never elective in
                            Germany, and that appointments to the bench are made only as above
                            stated.</p>

                            maintaining order. The court may adopt measures of compulsion

                            Without detriment to subsequent criminal prosecution, the court may also

                            superior land and land courts are under the provisions of imperial
                            legislation, fixed by Prussian law; and those of the amts courts by
                            royal decree. Once established, the latter can, however, only be changed
                            by law. Within the kingdom there are thus established 13 superior land
                            courts and 1,090 amts courts. At one and the same place, and at Berlin
                            only, are there two land courts. For each province of Prussia there is a
                            superior land court. For East Prussia, at Konigsberg; for West Prussia,
                            at Marienwerder; for Brandenburg, at Berlin; for Pomerania, at Stettin;
                            for Posen, at Posen; for Silesia, at Breslau; for Saxony (the Saxon

                            Hanover, at Celle; for Westphalia, at Hamm; for the Rhine province, at
                            Cologne. In the province of Hesse-Nassau alone are there two, at Cassel
                            and at Frankfort-on-the-Main. The provincial superior land court at
                            Berlin has the peculiar designation of chamber-court (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>In the amts courts schöffen courts are constituted. In the land courts
                            jury courts are periodically constituted, and also chambers for

                        <p>For the trial of certain criminal cases schöffen courts are formed at the
                            amts courts. This court consists of the amts judge, who presides, and of
                            two laymen.</p>
                        <p>“Schöffen,” in the singular number “schöffe,” is a word hardly
                            susceptible of translation, and I shall designate the court thus
                            compounded by the German name.</p>
                        <p>The schöffen are laymen called upon to decide, in conjunction with a
                            person learned in the law; a judge. Since 1848 the codes of criminal
                            procedure of certain German states had confided to the decision of
                            similar tribunals minor criminal cases before then assigned to public
                            authorities or to single judges. Such tribunals have been in particular
                            applauded by opponents of the jury system, who have gone so far as to
                            advocate the assignment to them, in a modified and enlarged form, of the
                            gravest criminal cases. By the law under consideration it will be
                            observed that no larger scope than cognizance of police ordinances and
                            of a number of minor offences has been awarded to them.</p>
                        <p>The law declares that the office of the laymen, who, in conjunction with
                            the amts judge, constitute the schöffen court, is one of honor, that
                            shall be exercised only by a German. Conviction for crime and certain
                            other disabilities constitute disqualifications for the office. Certain
                            categories of persons are declared ineligible owing to their position,
                            and others are <hi rend="italic">permitted</hi> to decline to assume
                            such duty on ground defined by law. A so-called original list, renewed
                            from year to year and containing the names of those persons who are
                            qualified and required to perform this service, is furnished by the
                            chief magistrate of the community to the amts judges; is by them
                            revised, and then submitted to a committee composed of trustworthy
                            citizens and a state administrative officer, which is presided over by
                            the amts judge, in order that an annual list for each business year may
                            be made out, the number of schöffen necessary for each amts courts
                            having been first fixed by the department of justice of the particular
                            state. The days for regular sessions of the schöffen courts are settled
                            in advance for the entire year, and the days on which individuals shall
                            participate are determined by lot. Like jurymen, schöffen are sworn
                            before assuming their judicial office, and are reimbursed for traveling
                            expenses. The essential differences between schöffen and the bench of
                            jurors consists in the fact that the schöffen and the judge constitute a
                            collective (<hi rend="italic">colleagual</hi>) body, which the jury and
                            judge do not. The schöffen court passes upon the law and the fact, the
                            jury upon the fact only. While the decisions of the former can be
                            appealed from, appeal is inadmissible in all other criminal
                            judgments.</p>

                        <p>The following persons are permitted to decline the performance of such
                            service: Members of any German legislative body; individuals who, during
                            the last business year, have performed jury or schöffen duty on at least

                            persons who succeed in making it appear credible that they cannot

                        <p>The jurisdiction of the schöffen courts embraces the following
                            offenses:</p>
                        <p>1. All contraventions (<hi rend="italic">Uebertretung</hi>) punishable
                            with confinement of from one day to six weeks.</p>
                        <p>2. Those misdemeanors punishable with imprisonment not exceeding three
                            months, or with fine not exceeding 600 marks. These penalties may be
                            adjudged separately or together, or conjointly with the penalty of
                            confinement, or together in conjunction with confiscation.</p>
                        <p>The words misdemeanor, confinement, and confiscation have, in the above
                            connection, a special technical meaning, and call for definition:
                            Misdemeanor, “vergehen,” is an act for which the maximum penalty is
                            imprisonment in a fortress, not exceeding five years; confinement,
                            “haft,” is imprisonment of from one day to six weeks; and by
                            confiscation, “enizichung,” the confiscation of the thing used or meant
                            to be used in the commission of a crime or misdemeanor, is intended.</p>
                        <p>Certain misdemeanors specially assigned to the land courts and stated
                            later on, are excepted.</p>
                        <p>3. Prosecutions for insults and bodily injuries, in which prosecution
                            ensues only upon complaint of the aggrieved party.</p>
                        <p>4. The misdemeanor of theft of personal property, the value of which does
                            not exceed 25 marks.</p>
                        <p>5. The embezzlement by a person of the property of another, in his
                            possession or care, when the value of the property does not exceed 25
                            marks.</p>
                        <p>6. The commission of fraud, the damage not exceeding 25 marks, by a
                            person, who in the pursuit of unlawful gain for himself or for a third
                            person, inflicts loss upon another by suggesting or supporting an error,
                            by false representation or by misstatement, or by suppression of true
                            facts.</p>
                        <p>7. Intentional or unlawful injury to, or destruction of, an article
                            belonging to another, the damage not exceeding 25 marks.</p>
                        <p>8. Certain acts of an accomplice after the fact, in particular cases
                            designated in the penal code, provided the act to which the offenses
                            refer comes under the jurisdiction of the schöffen courts.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the schöffen courts dispose of the criminal matters assigned to
                            them for trial and decison by the penal chambers of the land courts at
                            the opening of the trial, upon motion of the state’s attorney. In so far
                            as the schöffen courts have not already jurisdiction upon other grounds,
                            such assignment may take place in the following misdemeanors, the
                            circumstances justifying the assumption that no other or greater penalty
                            than that designated under figure 2, above, could be adjudged and no
                            higher fine than 600 marks could be imposed: <list>

                        <p>The land courts are composed of a president and the necessary number of
                            “directors” and members. Within these courts civil and penal chambers
                            and jury courts must be, and commercial chambers may be, formed if
                            deemed requisite. According to need a number of judges of inquisition
                            (examining judges) are appointed for them by the department of justice
                            of the particular state. The president presides in the plenum, and the
                            president and directors in the chambers, the president deciding before
                            the commencement of the business year to which chamber he will attach
                            himself. The latter and the directors decide by a majority of votes who
                            shall preside in the remaining chambers, the president giving the
                            casting vote in case of a tie. The president, the directors, and the
                            oldest members constitute the presidential college. Before the
                            commencement of the business year, and for the period of its duration,
                            the presidential college distributes business among chambers of the same
                            kind, and appoints the standing members of the individual chambers, as
                            well as their standing substitutes.</p>
                        <p>A quorum in the chambers, competent for decisions, consists of three
                            members, inclusive of the presiding judge. For trial purposes the penal
                            chambers must, as a court of appeals in “contraventions,” consist of
                            five, and in prosecutions upon private motion, of three members. In case
                            the regular presiding judge is hindered the oldest member of the chamber
                            takes his place, and in case a regular substitute of a member is
                            hindered the president appoints a temporary representative. If it be
                            found impossible to substitute for one member another of the same court,
                            the representative is appointed from another court by the department of
                            justice of the particular State, upon motion of the president of the
                            court, and such appointment is irrevocable during the period for which
                            it is made, and until the necessity has ceased to exist. The
                            compensation is to be fixed in advance for the entire period. The judges
                            of the amts courts are required to assume the representation in
                            particular sessions, and for particular affairs, of a judge of the land
                            court in which district they hold appointments. The department of
                            justice of the particular State may, on the ground of the remoteness of
                            the seat of the land court, direct that a penal chamber be formed and
                            attached to an amts court, for the district or districts of one or more
                            amts courts. The membership of such chamber consists of land or of amts
                            court judges of the district, and to such tribunal may be assigned the
                            full jurisdiction of the penal chamber of the land court, or a part
                            thereof. Such penal chambers have in Prussia been attached to 35 amts
                            courts.</p>
                        <p rend="center">B.—<hi rend="smallcaps">Jury courts.</hi></p>
                        <p>For the trial of penal cases jury courts are periodically constituted in
                            the land courts. For the decision of the question of guilt, they must
                            consist of three judicial members, inclusive of the presiding judge, and
                            of twelve jurors. The decisions in jury court trials are rendered by the
                            judicial members of the court, and in case the court be not in session,
                            by the penal chambers of the land courts. The presiding judge of the
                            jury court is appointed for the term by the president of the superior
                            land court from the membership of the latter court or that of the land
                            courts belonging to the district of such superior land court.</p>
                        <p>The substitute of the presiding judge and the remaining judges are
                            appointed by the president of the land court from the membership of the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>The office of juror is an office of honor to be exercised by a German
                            only. The qualifications are the same as for the schöffen. No one is
                            required to serve both as juror <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0253"
                            />and schöffe during the same business year. The president of the land
                            court determines the number of jurors requisite for each court, as also
                            their distribution among the various districts of the amts courts. A
                            committee, constituted for the purpose in amts court, selects annually
                            from the original list of schöffen the persons proposed as jurors (the
                            triple number assigned to the amts court district) and makes out a roll.
                            At a public session of the land court, in which five members, inclusive
                            of the president and directors, participate, the number of jurors
                            destined for the jury court are selected from the proposed roll and

                            the land court in open session, in which, in addition to the president
                            two members take part, constitutes by lot the special roll of jurymen
                            for the particular trial term. The formation of the jury for the
                            particular case is a part of the trial. Jurors not appearing for duty
                            are subject to the same penalties as schöffen in like cases. The penal
                            chamber of the land court may direct that particular jury court sessions
                            be held at some place other than the seat of the land court.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">C.—Commercial courts</hi>.</p>
                        <p>These courts for the trial of commercial cases are constituted in close
                            analogy to the schöffen courts hereinbefore described. The commercial
                            court is composed of an element learned in the law, of the judge, and of
                            business men, and passes upon both fact and law. Elsewhere than in
                            Germany, so far as I have read, no court exists of which a controlling
                            element is composed of laymen experts in the matter to be considered;
                            though certain tribunals in England constituted for particular
                            commercial interests, such as the courts of admiralty and bankruptcy,
                            may be regarded as some-what similar institutions, while in our own
                            country juries of experts are sometimes called upon to decide upon
                            questions of fact, although not upon the law.</p>
                        <p>The department of justice of the particular state may, if it think
                            proper, cause the formation of chambers for commercial cases at the seat
                            of the land courts for their respective districts, or elsewhere within
                            those districts, for designated parts of the same. To the jurisdiction
                            of the chambers for commercial matters, in case their jurisdiction is
                            invoked by one of the parties, belongs that civil litigation in which
                            the land courts have original jurisdiction, in which the complainant
                            seeks the enforcement of the following claims: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Claims against a merchant arising out of transactions which on

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Claims arising out of certain legal relations, such as the
                                    mutual relations among members of a commercial association or
                                    partnership; questions concerning the use of the firm name;
                                    those which relate to protection of trade-marks, samples, and
                                    models; questions concerning maritime law, &amp;c.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The commercial chambers organized for trial consist of a member of the
                            land court, who presides, and of two commercial judges, who have
                            respectively the same right of vote. The presiding judge may also be a
                            member of an amts court, if the seat of the commercial chamber is not
                            identical with that of the land court. In matters having reference to
                            the owner or master of a ship and the ship’s crew, the presiding judge
                            is competent to decide alone.</p>
                        <p>The office of a commercial judge is an office of honor, for which a
                            German only is qualified who is or has been duly registered as a
                            merchant, or as the head of a stock company, or who, at a sea-port,
                            belongs to the number of those persons familiar with navigation. He must
                            have completed his thirtieth year, must be a resident of the district of
                            the commercial chamber. All the rights and duties of a judicial officer
                            devolve upon him during his official term. Commercial judges are
                            appointed by the executive of the particular state upon motion of the
                            chamber of commerce, for the period of three years, and a reappointment
                            is permissible.</p>
                        <p>Commercial chambers are established at present in Prussia in twenty-seven
                            places—six of this number at places other than the seats of the land
                            courts. At Berlin there are eight, at Breslau and Cologne four each; and
                            at all other places one only. The number of commercial judges is so
                            distributed that two or four are assigned to each chamber. A like number
                            of substitutes are appointed. The presiding judge is designated by the
                            president of the land court for the period of the business year.</p>

                            empire, and in all claims against those officials for undue exercise of

                        <p rend="center">VII.</p>
                        <p>The supreme court of the empire consists of a president, of seven
                            presidents of senates, and of sixty judges (called councillors), who
                            must have attained their thirty-fifth year and be qualified for the
                            judicial office in one of the states of the confederation. They are
                            appointed by the Emperor upon the motion of the senate (<hi
                                rend="italic">Bundes rath</hi>) of the empire. If a member has been
                            condemned to a penalty for a dishonorable act, or to deprivation of
                            liberty for a longer period than one year, he may, by plenary resolution
                            of the supreme court, be declared to have forfeited his salary; and in
                            case he has been placed on trial for a crime or misdemeanor, the court
                            may, by such resolution, pronounce his temporary deposition from office.
                            Incarceration upon examination suspends <hi rend="italic">ipso
                                facto</hi> his functions. Temporary deposition does not affect
                            salary. In case of permanent incapacity arising from physical or mental
                            infirmity, the member is retired with a pension.</p>
                        <p>In the imperial court, civil and penal senates are constituted, which are
                            competent to decide when seven members, inclusive of the presiding
                            judge, are present. The number of the senates is determined by the
                            chancellor of the empire. At present there are five civil and three
                            penal senates. For the purpose of plenary decisions and the decisions of
                            several senates acting in conjunction, the presence of at least
                            two-thirds of all members, inclusive of the presiding judge, is
                            requisite. The number of members must be an odd one; otherwise the
                            member youngest in service has no vote. The distribution of business
                            among the senates, the appointment of the members of the individual
                            senates and of substitutes, are as in the land courts. The “presidential
                            college” consists of the president, the presidents of senates, and of
                            the four oldest members; at present the college has a membership of
                            thirteen. The cooperation of assistant judges (judges of other courts)
                            is inadmissible.</p>

                            is conditioned upon the value of the object of contention exceeding 300
                            marks; it has also jurisdiction in certain matters not litigious under
                            the provisions of the imperial law of 1879 concerning consular

                        <p rend="center">VIII.</p>
                        <p>The state attorneyship is represented in every court; in the supreme
                            court by a superior imperial attorney and by one or several imperial
                            attorneys; in the superior land courts, the land courts, and the jury
                            courts, by one or several state attorneys, whose competency shall,
                            however, extend to the preparation for public prosecution of such penal
                            cases as belong to the jurisdiction of others than the schöffen
                            courts.</p>
                        <p>If the state be represented in a court by several officials, all persons
                            associated with the chief official act as his representatives; while
                            acting for him they are entitled to perform all his offical functions
                            without being required to show any special authority. The first
                            officials of the state attorneyship attached to the superior land courts
                            are entitled to perform at all the courts of their district the
                            functions of state attorney or to assign the performance of such
                            functions to another than the official primarily competent.</p>
                        <p>The state attorney is in the exercise of his official functions
                            independent of the court. State attorneys do not transact judicial
                            business, nor is any supervision over judges intrusted to them. The
                            presiding judge of the court may, however, in matters which allow of no
                            delay, appoint a substitute to perform a state attorney’s functions, in
                            case the latter is hindered. All officers of the court, inclusive of the
                            judges, are required to assume the duties of a substitute in case of
                            necessity.</p>
                        <p>The local jurisdiction of state attorney officials is co-extensive with
                            that of the court to which they are attached. The subjects of their
                            jurisdiction are mainly penal matters.</p>
                        <p>Upon the state attorney devolves the duty of instituting the public
                            prosecution upon which judicial investigation is based. In so far as no
                            other course is prescribed by law the state attorney must, when the
                            facts warrant, prosecute for all acts judicially punishable. In but few
                            instances is his exclusive right to prosecute limited by the code of
                            criminal procedure.</p>
                        <p>The carrying of sentences into effect in all cases except those in which
                            the schöffen courts have decided as courts of the first instance,
                            devolves upon the states attorney of the land court; he further decides
                            as to the suspension and interruption of punishment.</p>
                        <p>In civil litigation, and in matters not litigious, the state attorney is
                            only called upon to act in some few matters connected with divorce and
                            wardship, and other subjects designated by the civil code of procedure
                            and other laws.</p>
                        <p>The first officials of the state attorneyship attached to the superior
                            land courts have the official title “superior state attorneys”; the
                            first, attached to the land courts, the official title “first state
                            attorneys”; all other officials of the state attorneyship attached to
                            superior land and land courts, the official title “state attorneys.”</p>
                        <p>The superior imperial attorneys and the imperial attorneys are appointed
                            by the Emperor upon the motion of the German Senate, In Prussia the
                            superior state and state attorneys are appointed by the King. The
                            superior imperial attorney, the superior state attorneys, and the state
                            attorneys are not judicial officials, although only such persons as are
                            qualified for the judicial office are eligible; they are therefore
                            governed, as regards discipline, liability to be transferred, &amp;c.,
                            by the principles which obtain for other state officials.</p>
                        <p>There are some peculiarities connected with the organization of the state
                            attorney offices attached to the amts courts. The appointment of amts
                            attorneys is subject to revocation, and no qualifications for such
                            appointments are prescribed. The business of such office may, by the
                            department of justice of the particular state, be intrusted to a state
                            attorney, or to a court assessor, or to a referendarius, in so far as
                            judicial business of a penal nature may not at the same time have been
                            confided to him. In case this authority is not exercised, the
                            appointment is made by the superior state attorney.</p>

                        <p>Under the provisions of the code of civil procedure parties who have the
                            legal capacity, and who desire to adjust a disputed claim without
                            recourse to law, may agree that it be referred to one or more arbiters
                            for decision. In case the agreement does <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185"
                                facs="0257"/>not provide for the manner of appointing the arbiters,
                            each party is entitled to appoint one. Women, minors, the deaf and dumb,
                            and persons who have forfeited civil rights of honor may be rejected.
                            The arbiters must hear the parties, and, in so far as it appears to be
                            necessary, investigate the facts upon which the dispute is based. The
                            procedure is regulated in the absence of any agreement by the parties,
                            according to the discretion of the arbiters, who may examine such
                            witnesses and experts as voluntarily appear before them. The arbiters
                            are, however, not competent to swear witnesses, experts, or the parties.
                            If, in their opinion, it becomes necessary to administer an oath, such
                            function is, upon motion of one of the parties, performed by the
                            appropriate regular court, if it deem such course admissible. In case
                            the tribunals consist of several arbiters, the decision is by absolute
                            majority of votes, the agreement of the parties making no other
                            provision. The judgment must bear the date on which it was rendered, be
                            subscribed by the arbiters, served on the parties, and deposited with
                            proof of such service in the office of the appropriate court of law.
                            Such judgment has, as between the parties, the effect of a legal
                            judicial judgment.</p>
                        <p>This judgment can, however, only be enforced after its sufficiency has
                            upon motion of one of the parties, been pronounced by a court of law.
                            The judgment of the arbiters can only be contested upon legal grounds,
                            within the period of a month, before the court of law.</p>
                        <p>The following are the principal grounds upon which a motion that the
                            judgment be annulled may be based:</p>
                        <p>Upon the ground that the procedure was inadmissible, or that the
                            performance of an illicit act by one of the parties has been adjudged,
                            or that the party was not represented at the proceedings according to
                            law, in so far as such party has not, by express or implied assent,
                            waived the right to make such plea; or that a rightful hearing has not
                            been accorded the party; or that the judgment is not accompanied by a
                            statement of the grounds upon which it was rendered.</p>
                        <p>The judgment may also be contested upon an allegation of fraud by a party
                            or by an arbiter.</p>
                        <p>In case no particular amts or land court is named in the agreement of the
                            parties, the amts or land court having the ordinary jurisdiction over
                            the claim is competent for all proceedings subsequent to the decision of
                            the tribunal of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The arbitration heretofore considered is entirely voluntary. In Prussia a
                            system of arbitration, or reconciliation, as it is sometimes termed, is
                            established by law, which, in certain matters; is of a different
                            character. Under this system a party to a dispute in civil matters,
                            other than in tort, may, in order to prevent litigation, cause the other
                            party to be summoned to appear with him before a certain arbiter, upon
                            whom the duty devolves of adjusting the claim, if it be possible, The
                            proceedings before this official are much the same as those before the
                            arbitration tribunals herinebefore discussed.</p>
                        <p>The arbiter is required to enter in a journal the results of the attempts
                            made before him to adjust claims. If a compromise is effected its terms
                            are enforceable at law.</p>
                        <p>In those matters in tort, in which prosecution for bodily injuries or
                            injuries to character ensues only upon the complaint of the aggrieved
                            party, an unsuccessful attempt to compromise the difficulty before the
                            arbiter must precede prosecution. Proceedings for divorce can only be
                            instituted upon the production of proof that an ineffectual attempt at
                            reconciliation has been made before the pastor of the parties, if they
                            have one, or otherwise before an arbiter. The arbiters, 211 of whom
                            officiate in Berlin alone, are appointed for particular districts by
                            communal representative bodies, and their appointment requires the
                            confirmation of the presidential college of the appropriate land court.
                            Arbiters receive no salaries, and there are no charges made in these
                            tribunals except for copying and actual disbursements. They relieve the
                            courts of law of a vast burden, and their great usefulness from many
                            points of view is generally acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>The circumstance may be mentioned that the principle of arbitration is
                            honored in a higher and very different sphere in Germany. The
                            Constitution of the German Empire provides, in Article 76, that
                            conflicts among the various States of the Confederation, in so far as
                            they are not of a private nature, are to be disposed of by the Federal
                            Council (“Bundesrath”) of the empire, when its action is invoked by a
                            State, and also that the Federal Council shall, when called upon to do
                            so, amicably adjust conflicts concerning a constitution in those states
                            in which the constitution designates no authority for the settlement of
                            such conflicts.</p>

                            mentioned under this head.</p>
                        <p>Presidents of senates receive from 7,500 to 8,700, and other judges
                            receive from 4,800 to 5,700 marks. The superior state attorneys attached

                        <p>In the supreme court of the empire: The president of this court receives
                            a salary of 27,000 marks; the presidents of senates receive from 15,000

                        <p>Every official of the empire, and every Prussian official is entitled to
                            a pension for life who after at least ten years’ service, becomes
                            permanently incapacitated for the performance of official duty through
                            bodily disease or bodily or mental weakness. If this incapacity is the
                            consequence of disease, wound, or other injury acquired or received by
                            the official in the performance of his duty, or if, without fault of his

                            performance of the tenth year of service, twenty-eightieths of his
                            latest salary, and increases with every additional year of service by

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit a return of
                        so-called military cases of naturalized Americans which have been disposed
                        of since the date of the last report, to September 1, 1882. A number of
                        cases are still pending, including Nos. 88 and 92. Nos. 80 and 81 are only
                        inferentially settled.</p>
                    <p>These cases do not represent nearly all the work of the legation in such
                        matters. Many cases of threatened or feared oppression by the local
                        authorities are brought to the attention of the legation. The fear in some
                        of these cases may be groundless, but adverse action is often averted by
                        certified copies of the treaty of 1868, and of the circular of the minister
                        of justice, enjoining on local authorities observance of the treaty rights
                        of naturalized Americans. These papers the legation furnishes; and they do
                        excellent work in advising the local authorities of their duty in the
                        premises. The legation is thus relieved, and is able to relieve the imperial
                        foreign office of a crowded calendar of such cases.</p>

                                early part of May, 1881, and said that he was a naturalized American
                                citizen temporarily residing in Posen on account of his father’s
                                business and his wife’s critical state of health. He likewise stated
                                that he had already resided in Germany more than the <pb n="187"
                                    xml:id="pg_187" facs="0259"/>two years allowed by the treaty,
                                and that the police of Wreschen had notified him to leave, but that
                                he was anxious to be allowed to remain until August 1 next, by which
                                time he hoped that his father’s business would be wound up and his
                                wife would be strong enough to travel. On the 9th of May the
                                legation applied to the foreign office for the requisite permission
                                for Gherson to prolong his stay, and on the 25th of May the legation
                                was informed, in reply, that Gherson would not, for the present, be
                                interfered with, and on the 13th July, that the desired prolongation
                                of his stay was granted, of which he was duly informed.</item>

                                1872, to the United States, where he was naturalized on the 22d
                                October, 1878. In April, 1881, he returned to his native town, and
                                on the 4th of May was compelled by the authorities of Rogasen to pay
                                a fine of 180 marks for avoidance of military duty, although he
                                exhibited his American certificate of naturalization and passport.
                                The former document was sent by the burgomaster of Ritschenwalde to

                                the fine had been remitted by imperial order, of which fact Mr.

                                where he was naturalized October 24, 1878. On the 19th of May, 1881,
                                he returned to Germany with the intention of remaining there six
                                months only. On his arrival at his native place he was arrested and
                                imprisoned for evasion of military duty, but released on payment of
                                275 marks. The legation called the attention of the foreign office
                                to the case on the 2d June, and on the 8th July was informed that
                                the fine would be remitted, which information was at once conveyed
                                to Mr. Eger, though the consul at Chemnitz. Nothing further has been
                                heard by the legation in regard to the matter. It is therefore
                                presumed that the money was repaid.</item>

                                weeks; and on the 18th of the same month the son was arrested by the
                                local authorities of his native town, hurried off to Cologne, and
                                there enrolled in the Seventy-sixth Regiment of Infantry. The
                                legation was informedof the case by the consul at Barmen on the 20th
                                June, and at once wrote to the foreign office. On the 10th of July a
                                reply was received informing the legation that Brink had been
                                released on the 30th of June, of which fact the legation had already
                                been informed by the consul at Barmen. On July 16 an instruction was
                                received from Washington to apply for his release, which was replied
                                to in accordance with the facts. The case was supposed to be ended,
                                when the legation was again apprised by the consul that a fine had
                                been imposed on Brink, and on the 28th of July the foreign office
                                was again written to on the subject, and on the 3d of September a
                                reply was received stating that the fine had been annulled; and the
                                legation finally heard from the consul that Brink had received back
                                his money.</item>

                                at the age of fifteen years, to the United States, where he was
                                naturalized February 20, 1877. After a residence of over 9 years in
                                the United States, he returned on the 11th June, 1881, to his native
                                place on a visit, and was soon compelled to pay a fine of 204 marks
                                for neglect of military duty, in spite of his exhibiting proofs of
                                American citizenship. The legation intervened for him on June 23,
                                1881, immediately on hearing of his case; and on the 11th July was
                                informed by the foreign office that his fine would be repaid. The

                                Oelrich’s brother said the fine had never been repaid, but a
                                correspondence with the consul at Hamburg revealed the fact that
                                this was not so, and that the fine had been duly repaid him, and
                                that he had left for America, which was communicated to the
                                Department of State in dispatch 249 on the 5th September, 1881. Mr.
                                Oelrich subsequently wrote to the legation from America informing it
                                that he was entirely pleased with its successful effort in his

                                emigrated to America in 1850, and was naturalized therein October,
                                1850. George Weigand visited Germany for the first time in 1871, and
                                after traveling some months in Switzerland and France took up his
                                residence in Cologne. On July 24, 1881, he was summoned to do
                                military service in the Twenty-eighth Regiment. On the 6th of July,

                                which he became an officer in the American merchant marine. On July
                                1, 1881, he arrived at Bremerhaven-Geestemünde as first mate of the
                                ship John de Costa, and made a visit to his parents at Breslau. On
                                his return to Geestemünde he was summoned to pay a fine of 195 marks
                                or go to prison. As the local authorities entirely disregarded the
                                consul’s intervention, a note was addressed to the foreign office as
                                soon as the case became known to the legation, requesting that
                                orders might be sent by telegraph that Boettcher be not molested, as
                                his ship was to sail in two days. This was done, and Boettcher

                                September 3, 1853; left Germany in 1868. As a sailor he was two
                                years at sea. He arrived in the United States in 1870, and was
                                naturalized there in 1876. In February, 1880, he took a passport
                                from the Department of State, and in July, 1881, returned to Germany
                                on a visit. On the 6th of July he was arrested and imprisoned for
                                three days at Meppen; and on the 9th was forced to pay a fine of 200
                                marks or remain in prison eighteen months longer, although the
                                authorities saw his American papers. The legation, on investigating
                                the case, found that Mr. Bruns’ residence in the United States
                                before naturalization had been interrupted by a long interval spent
                                in Germany and elsewhere, and also that during this interval he took
                                out a German passport in Germany. His naturalization seemed
                                therefore contrary to the laws of the United States for such cases,
                                as well as contrary to the terms of the naturalization treaty of
                                1868 between Germany and the United States. Before intervening, the
                                case was therefore reported to Washington in dispatch No. 235,
                                August 8, 1881, and in response, in instruction No. 257, of the 26th
                                of August, the Department of State disagreed with the legation in
                                its view of the case, and directed intervention for Mr. Bruns. A
                                note was accordingly addressed to the foreign office on the 15th
                                September in his behalf, and on the 11th October a reply was
                                received stating that his fine had been remitted. Of this he was
                                duly informed, and his papers were returned to him December 30,
                                1881. The interesting point in this case is the construction put
                                upon the term “uninterrupted residence” as required by the laws and
                                treaties of the United States.</item>

                                he was duly naturalized in Baltimore, September 7, 1877. In the same
                                year he returned to Europe and resided principally in Austria. On

                                visit to his parents. Immediately on his arrival he was arrested for
                                neglect of military duty, and was not released until he had
                                deposited the sum of 190 florins as security for the payment of the

                                Baden. The authorities finally informed him that as he appeared to
                                be an American citizen this deposit would be returned, but, as no
                                result followed, he appealed to the legation, which, after

                                less the trifling costs of the investigation of the case, deducted
                                by the local authorities, though it resulted in his favor. This was

                                October, 1865, and have resided there ever since with them. On July
                                1, 1881, the elder of them being now twenty-four years old, and the
                                younger sixteen, they were notified by the authorities of Frankfort
                                that they could no longer be allowed to reside there, and that their

                                resided uninterruptedly over five years, and was naturalized January
                                4, 1878. In April, 1878, he returned to Pyrmont, in Germany, where
                                he has remained ever since. On March 10, 1881, he received a summons
                                to appear before the amts court at Pyrmont, and in reply to their
                                questions announced his intention to retain his American nationality
                                and to return to America, but requested <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189"
                                    facs="0261"/>permission to remain some months longer, in order
                                to close up his business affairs with his brother. Mr. Cordes
                                represents that he understood that a verbal promise was given to
                                take this request into consideration and to send him a reply;
                                consequently he did not leave at once for America, but went over to
                                England. On May 18 he was sent for again by the amts court, as he
                                supposed, to receive the reply to his request. But to his surprise
                                he was at once taken to Arolsen, and put into the regiment at that
                                place. The legation entered into a correspondence with Mr. Cordes
                                and his brother to ascertain whether it was ever his intention to
                                return to America, and if he would still do so at once if liberated.
                                The replies were so evasive and unsatisfactory that the legation did
                                not feel authorized to intervene, especially as Cordes, having
                                actually resided more than the two years allowed by treaty, was
                                consequently liable to be considered by the German Government to
                                have forfeited his American nationality. On the 26th, November,
                                however, as both brothers promised that Cordes should return at once
                                to America, if liberated, the legation addressed a request to the

                                Wurtemberg, August 10, 1845; emigrated May 25, 1872, at the age of
                                twenty-seven, to the United States, where, after serving five years
                                in the United States Army, he was naturalized October 14, 1878. On
                                the 11th November, 1881, he returned to Germany, and on the 23d of
                                the same month was arrested and taken to prison in Kirchheim, where
                                he was confined in the company of a common criminal, and only
                                released on the 30th. The legation immediately on hearing of the
                                case applied to the foreign office for his release, which was
                                readily granted. By the correspondence subsequently held with the
                                foreign office, it appeared that Buder had not produced any evidence
                                of his American nationality, though in his statement made to the
                                consul he asserted that he had. The case seems to have been finally
                                settled to his satisfaction.</item>

                                legation was first called to this case by one Hulziger, who, on
                                January 11, 1881, wrote from the United States as the attorney for
                                Johannes Blum, also residing there. In this communication the
                                legation was asked to ascertain why a certain inheritance due Mr.
                                Blum at Harburg had not been delivered over to Mr. Blum’s duly
                                accredited agent. In the course of a correspondence with the consul
                                at Hamburg, near which city Harburg is situated, it was ascertained
                                that the inheritance could not be paid over, owing to an attachment
                                placed upon the same by the authorities to secure a contumacial
                                judgment imposed on Mr. Blum for avoidance of military duty. The
                                legation thereupon notified Mr. Blum of that fact, and after
                                receiving back a “military case” form, transmitted to him to be
                                filled in, intervened in his behalf with the foreign office on

                                legation that the fine had been remitted and the attachment removed.
                                The legation at once informed Mr. Blum through his agent of this
                                gratifying result, and advised him how to proceed to secure
                                possession of the inheritance.</item>

                                1882, Mr. Joseph Gruszynski wrote to the legation informing it that
                                he was a naturalized citizen of the United States, and asking its
                                intervention to protect him from the payment of a fine of 180 marks
                                for violation of military duty with the alternative of imprisonment.
                                The data furnished in the case not being sufficient, the legation
                                transmitted to him, on the day of the receipt of his complaint, the
                                customary “military case” form to be filled in and returned. On the
                                16th of January, immediately upon the receipt from Mr. Gruszynski of
                                the needful information, the legation addressed a note to the
                                foreign office in his behalf. On the 19th of January the foreign
                                office informed it in reply that an investigation had been ordered,
                                and on the 26th of that month that the fine had been duly remitted.
                                The legation at once informed Mr. Gruszynski that he need fear no
                                further molestation; and as nothing further has been heard from him,
                                it would seem that all proceedings against him have been

                                the legation received a letter from Charles R. Waentig written from
                                the United States, in which he informed it that he was a naturalized
                                citizen of the United States, and that a fine for violation of
                                military duty had been imposed upon him by the Saxon authorities,
                                which he begged the legation would have removed. He also wrote that
                                he had instructed a friend in Germany, who had the custody of his
                                papers, to transmit them here. Mr. Waentig’s letter containing all
                                needed information, and his papers arriving on the 15th of March the
                                legation on that day submitted his case to the foreign office. Mr.
                                Waentig had emigrated to the United States at the age of eighteen,
                                in 1873, and had been naturalized there on September 28, 1880. In
                                the spring of 1881 he revisited his native place in <pb n="190"
                                    xml:id="pg_190" facs="0262"/>Saxony for a few weeks. While there
                                he was informed of the imposition of the fine of 300 marks. He
                                contested the matter in the local courts, but unsuccessfully; and
                                then returned to the United States, and subsequently appealed to
                                this legation. In reponse to its note, the legation was informed by
                                the foreign office on April 19, 1882, that the authorities had been
                                duly instructed to desist from all proceedings against Mr. Waentig.
                                The legation at once conveyed to Mr. Waentig this satisfactory
                                intelligence, and returned him his passport and certificate of
                                naturalization.</item>

                                1, following, directed the legation to intervene in behalf of Mr.
                                Sens who had been fined for neglect of military duty. The data
                                furnished the Department by Mr. Sens’ agent in the United States
                                proving too meager, the legation addressed itself directly to that
                                gentleman, inclosing the “military case” form to be filled out and
                                returned. The legation then informed the Department of the course it
                                had taken, and its action was subsequently approved.</item>
                            <label/>
                            <item>On March 24 following, the needed information having on that day
                                been received from the United States, the legation submitted the
                                case to the foreign office. The chief facts were the following: Mr.
                                Sens was born in Alsace-Lorraine in 1858, emigrated in March, 1874,
                                to the United States, where he was naturalized and where he still
                                resides. In May, 1881, the land court imposed a fine of 680 marks on
                                him for non-performance of military duty, and his property was
                                attached to secure payment. The legation at once informed the
                                Department of State that it had intervened. On March 27 the foreign
                                office informed the legation that an investigation had been ordered,
                                and on August 25 last that the fine had been remitted and the
                                attachment removed. The legation at once acquainted the Department
                                of State and Mr. Sens’ agent with this favorable result of its
                                intervention, anticipating an inquiry as to the progress made in the
                                case, which was subsequently received from the Department. The
                                result in this case was the more gratifying for the reason that Mr.
                                Sens was a native of Alsace-Lorraine, and as affording ground for
                                the belief that the German Government is not now disposed to insist
                                on the ground taken in August, 1880, which excluded naturalized
                                American citizens of Alsace-Lorraine birth from the benefits of the
                                treaties with the German States, regulating nationality since all
                                such cases submitted to and passed upon by the German Government,
                                five in number, have been favorably decided.</item>

                                by the authorities with enrollment in the army, and requested the
                                legation to intervene in his behalf. On April 6, the day of the
                                receipt his communication, the legation wrote to Unterseh requesting
                                him to furnish it with the information called for in the inclosed

                                instant, the legation at once intervened for him with the foreign
                                office. The facts it was able to present were the following: he was
                                born at Neudorf February 2, 1851, and emigrated in 1872, at the age
                                of twenty-one, to the United States, where he was naturalized
                                October 20, 1880, returning to Germany on a visit, <hi rend="italic"

                            <item>In reply to its communication the foreign office informed the

                                ordered, and on September 5 following that Unterseh had declared it
                                to be his intention to remain in Germany permanently. Upon the
                                receipt of this note the legation immediately wrote to Unterseh,
                                communicating its contents, and calling his attention to the fact
                                that the declaration he was represented to have made was equivalent
                                to a renunciation of his naturalization under Article 4 of the
                                treaty of February 28, 1868, a copy of which was inclosed to him
                                with the article marked. No answer was received from him, and none
                                was expected, it being pretty evident that he had voluntarily
                                relinquished his American citizenship in order to remain permanently
                                in Germany. On September 25 the legation reported the case fully to

                                from the Department of State on the 27th of April last, directing
                                that an informal enquiry be made at the German foreign office as to
                                whether Mr. Henry Bolln was regarded as on military service in
                                Germany, and whether he could safely revisit that country. Though
                                satisfied that he could safely return, as he had never been enrolled
                                in the German army, the legation informally applied to the foreign
                                office, and has been informed that there is no obstacle in the way
                                of Mr. Bolln revisiting Germany. This information has been conveyed
                                to Mr. Bolln. The principal facts in the case were as follows: Mr.
                                Bolln was born in Schleswig-Holstein in 1274, went before a board of
                                officers at Kiel in 1868, was found qualified for service as a one
                                year volunteer, and was directed to report for service to such
                                regiment as he might select, before October, 1871, or as soon as war
                                should be declared. Without having reported for military service he
                                emigrated in 1869 to the United States, where he was naturalized in
                                March, 1875.</item>

                                legation received a telegram from Colon Horstmann, stating that his
                                son Bernhard, who had emigrated in 1872 to the <pb n="191"
                                    xml:id="pg_191" facs="0263"/>United States, where he was
                                naturalized, had been arrested by the military authorities without
                                reason, at Burgsteinfurt, where he was making a visit; the father
                                asked that his immediate release be effected. The legation at once
                                addressed a note to the foreign office in behalf of Mr. Horstmann,
                                and at the same time wrote to his father inclosing a “military case”
                                form to be filled in with further necessary data. On May 4 an answer
                                was received from the father conveying further information in the
                                case, but containing no allusion to the fact that his son was
                                charged with desertion. The additional information thus obtained was
                                at once transmitted to the foreign office, which in a note to this
                                legation, dated the 5th and received the 8th of May, informed it
                                that an investigation had been ordered. On the 8th of May the father
                                wrote to the legation, in a letter received here on May 10, that his
                                son was charged with desertion, but the father urged that the charge
                                was not true. On May 29 a note from the foreign office, dated May
                                26, was received here, informing the legation that the investigation
                                had resulted in showing that Bernhard Horstmann was properly held as
                                a deserter from the First Westphalian Regiment No. 13, and that he
                                had been sentenced to a fine of 150 marks and to six months’
                                imprisonment for desertion, which action was in accord with the
                                provisions of the treaty of February 22, 1868. On the day of the
                                receipt of this note the legation communicated the result of the
                                investigation to Mr. Horstmann’s father, and also to the Department
                                of State, with copies of the entire correspondence.</item>
                            <label/>
                            <item>It would appear also that Mr. Horstmann had also applied directly
                                to the Government at Washington for aid, as a telegram was received
                                here from the Department of State on May 30, directing intervention
                                in the case. The legation, having anticipated the wishes of the
                                Department, informed it by wire on the same day that he was held for
                                desertion, and that the correspondence had already been transmitted
                                to Washington. On June 12 a letter of the 9th of that month was
                                received from Bernhard Horstmann, protesting that he was innocent of
                                any knowledge of being a deserter, and had been informed in the
                                United States by an <hi rend="italic">agent</hi> that he could
                                safely revisit Germany. The result of the investigation was at once
                                communicated to him in reply, and he was informed that it had been
                                conveyed to his father at an earlier date; and the latter
                                correspondence was on the same day transmitted to the Department of
                                State.</item>

                            <item>The facts stated by Mr. Horstman in the military case form, and
                                submitted to the foreign office upon intervention in his behalf,
                                were the following: He was born at Hollich, near Burgsteinfurt,
                                Germany, February 25, 1851, and emigrated November 10, 1872, to the
                                United States where he was naturalized in 1881. In February, 1882,
                                he returned to his native place, where he was arrested for desertion
                                on April 29 last.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Otto Schatz</hi>.—On the 24th of May the
                                legation received a telegram from Schatz, stating that he would be
                                put in the military service the next day, and that Mr. Lipke, a
                                member of the German Parliament, would call at the legation with his
                                papers and explain the case. The visit of Mr. Lipke and Mr. Kapp,
                                both members of the Reichstag, did not throw any light on the case
                                or the facts of his enrollment. Schatz followed up his telegram with
                                a letter, dated 24th May, which stated that the authorities had not
                                given the option to him of leaving Germany beyond asking whether he
                                meant to do so, though not giving the date of this inquiry, which it
                                subsequently appeared was as long before as July, 1881, and two
                                years after his return to Germany. At once, on the receipt of this
                                letter, the legation addressed a note to the foreign office, asking
                                that Schatz’s case might be investigated, and that he might be
                                released from military service pending the investigation. Schatz was
                                then informed that the legation had intervened for him, and a
                                “military case” form was sent for him to fill out with the
                                particulars of his emigration. In this he stated that he was born in
                                Greussen, December 24, 1854; that he emigrated to America in July,
                                1872; was naturalized August 24, 1879; returned to Germany June 17,
                                1879, and intended to go back to the United States in 1882.</item>
                            <label/>
                            <item>On June 14 a reply was received from the foreign office, which
                                stated that Schatz had previously returned to Germany in 1878, and
                                that on his second visit in 1879 he had gone into business with his
                                brother in Greussen, and also addressed a direct petition to the
                                Emperor, asking permission to reimmigrate, to become again a Germany
                                citizen, and to be dispensed from actual military service; that he
                                was informed in reply that he was quite at liberty, under the
                                treaty, without permission, to recover his German citizenship, and
                                that no bargain could be made with him as regards military service,
                                which is obligatory; that two years later an admonitory demand was
                                made on him whether he intended to return to America or not; that in
                                reply to this Schatz was understood to signify his intention of
                                leaving, but did not do so. He was therefore finally summoned before
                                a military commission, and as he only protested for family reasons
                                against being enrolled, and did not suggest going to America, or
                                that he still claimed American citizenship, he was, after the usual
                                medical examination, mustered into the Seventy-first Regiment of
                                Infantry. In face of this statement, which seemed to show sufficient
                                consideration, and repeated warnings to Schatz on the part of the
                                military authorities, and a direct offer on his part to become a
                                German citizen, if exempted from military service, taken in
                                connection with his having deliberately overstayed the two years
                                allowed by the treaty, and having gone into <pb n="192"
                                    xml:id="pg_192" facs="0264"/>business with his brother, the
                                legation did not feel justified in protesting against the action of
                                the German Government, unless directed to do so by the Department.
                                Accordingly, the whole correspondence was inclosed to the
                                Department, and Schatz was notified that nothing more could be done
                                for him without instructions from the Department. July 19 an
                                instruction from the Department, received August 3, approved of the
                                course of the legation.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Louis Lewin</hi>.—On July 17 last, Mr. Lewin
                                called in person at this legation, and made the following
                                statements: He was born at Wreschen, in Prussia, May 15, 1856, and
                                emigrated in May, 1873, at the age of seventeen, to the United
                                States, where he was naturalized April 10, 1882. On May 25 last, he
                                returned to Germany to make a brief visit to his relatives. Lewin
                                was on July 14, following, informed by the local authorities that he
                                must pay 150 marks or suffer one month’s imprisonment for violation
                                of military duty. When Lewin protested against such action and
                                appealed to his American citizenship and treaty rights, he was told
                                by the officials that all that made no difference; that officer,
                                however, finally agreed to accept security to be furnished upon
                                demand by the 17th of that month, and discharged Lewin for the time
                                being. The legation advised him to again call the attention of the
                                local authorities at Wreschen to the provisions of the treaty of
                                February 22, 1868, and also to exhibit to them certain decrees
                                furnished him by the legation which were issued in execution of that
                                treaty by the royal Prussian ministers of justice and the interior
                                on the 5th and 6th of July, 1868. This course having been pursued by
                                Lewin, but without any good effect, the local land court judge
                                remarking that the law had been changed, and that he would issue a
                                warrant (<hi rend="italic">steckbrief</hi>) to arrest Lewin, if not
                                found when wanted, the legation on July 24 presented the above facts
                                to the foreign office, and asked for a speedy discontinuance of
                                hostile proceedings against Mr. Lewin. On July 28 a note was
                                received from the foreign office stating that an investigation had
                                been ordered, and on the 14th of August, following, a second note,
                                in which the legation was informed that the fine had been remitted
                                and that Mr. Lewin would not be further molested. This gratifying
                                intelligence was conveyed to Mr. Lewin through his family at
                                Wreschen, he having in the mean time returned to the United
                                States.</item>

                        of the 9th of December last, I have the honor to acquaint you that
                        immediately after its receipt I addressed a letter to Lord Granville,
                        stating the fact of Mr. Dennis H. O’Connor’s naturalization as an American
                        citizen, his arrest and imprisonment by the British authorities in Ireland,
                        and the probable result to his health of his continued incarceration. I
                        requested to be informed as to the grounds upon which he had been arrested
                        and imprisoned.</p>
                    <p>On the 30th of December, Sir J. Pauncefote, in the absence of Lord Granville,
                        informed me that he had referred my inquiries to the proper department of
                        Her Majesty’s Government, and to-day I have received a further communication
                        from his lordship stating the grounds of Mr. O’Connor’s arrest, and that the
                        lord lieutenant of Ireland would cause inquiry to be made with the view of
                        considering whether the prisoner could now be discharged without danger to
                        the peace of the district.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have received to-day from Mr. Blaine
                            a dispatch stating that Mr. P. C. O’Connor, of Baltimore, Md., has
                            informed the Department of State that his brother, Mr. Dennis H.
                            O’Connor, a naturalized American citizen, has, without cause, been
                            arrested and imprisoned by the British authorities in Ireland on
                            suspicion of being in sympathy with the Irish National Land League.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blaine incloses a copy of the certificate of the naturalization of
                            Dennis H. O’Connor, and also a letter from P. C. O’Connor, above
                            mentioned, by which it appears that the said Dennis went to Ireland
                            about four years ago and engaged in general drapery business in
                            Charleville, in the county of Cork, under the firm name of O’Connor
                            &amp; Molony, and in Kilmarnock, Limerick County, under the firm name of
                            D. H. O’Connor &amp; Co. It is further stated that his incarceration, if
                            continued, may prove fatal, as his health is not good, and may also
                            injure him financially, as he is at the head of the two business
                            establishments, with all his means at present in the hands of strange
                            clerks and salesmen.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Blaine instructs me to bring this subject
                            to the attention of your lordship, with the request that I may be
                            informed as to the grounds upon which Mr. O’Connor was arrested and
                            imprisoned.</p>

                            the 22d of October last under his excellency’s warrant, issued pursuant
                            to the “protection of person and property (Ireland) act, 1881,” on the
                            ground that he was reasonably suspected of inciting to intimidation
                            against the payment of rent. His excellency proceeds to state that he
                            has no reason to doubt the propriety of the arrest, but will, however,
                            cause inquiry to be made with the view of considering whether the
                            prisoner could now be discharged without danger to the peace of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Inclosed herewith find duplicate of
                            naturalization papers of Michael Hart, lately a resident of No. 167
                            Essex street, Lawrence, Mass., and now a prisoner in Clonmel jail,
                            county Tipperary, Ireland. I also inclose slip from Catholic Herald,
                            dated January 28, 1882 (antedated), containing printed copies of letters
                            from the prisoner and from his sister to relations here, by which you
                            will see the manner and cause of his arrest. (No. 1.)</p>
                        <p>Michael Hart came to this country at the age of sixteen years. On the
                            first Monday of October, 1878, he was admitted a citizen of the United
                            States, and thereafter had his name entered upon the “check-list,” or
                            registry of voters of this city, in confirmation of which I inclose
                            certificate from the city clerk of Lawrence. (No. 2.)</p>
                        <p>Michael Hart’s citizenship is thus established beyond the possibility of
                            a doubt. The fact of his imprisonment is also established, and that he
                            is now and has been guiltless of any infringement or violation of
                            British law can be established to your satisfaction. His arrest and
                            imprisonment being thus wholly without cause, you are now called upon to
                            demand his release.</p>

                        <p>A young man named Michael Hart, formerly a resident of Lawrence, Mass.,
                            went to Ireland on a visit recently to see his people. While there he
                            was visited by the “peelers,” and taken from his bed at 3 o’clock a.m.,
                            and with another man, named Cotter, was hurried off to Clonmel jail.</p>
                        <p>Hart came to this country before he was sixteen years of age. When
                            arrived at the age of twenty-one he took out his naturalization papers

                                    Michael was arrested this morning about 3 o’clock, under the
                                    coercion act, and sent to Clonmel jail. You cannot know what
                                    trouble we are in. God only knows how we are spending Christmas.
                                    No one knows the state of Ballintubber at present. Every one was
                                    rushing to our house when it became known that Michael was gone;
                                    but he has gone for no shameful crime. He told mother, when
                                    going, not to drop a tear for him; that he would come out
                                    without a stain. He had a comrade going with him, Edmund Cotter,
                                    from Car-ragane. You may be sure they had a good guard of
                                    police; a sub-inspector and two head constables came into the
                                    house with a warrant for him; the rest of the police remained
                                    outside on the road with two cars. They gave him time to dress.
                                    When he went out we were more than surprised to see Ned Cotter
                                    outside, and the first word he said was, ‘I suppose —— did not
                                    get his rent.’ Bridget replied, ‘He may not be alive when you
                                    come out.’ I suppose —— was the cause of Cotter’s arrest, too.
                                    Michael began to laugh when he saw Cotter; I suppose there will
                                    be more arrests. The people here say they will not pay one
                                    halfpenny of rent while Michael is in jail; so it is the worst
                                    day’s work —— ever done. Michael told us to let you know that he
                                    is an American citizen, and to see about this.</p>

                            is his duty. No second appeal was made to President Pierce in the case
                            of citizen Kotza, who was arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian
                            authorities. The question then propounded, “Do you or do you not respect

                            who have become American citizens?” should now be propounded anew to

                            attention is herewith called, but likewise to any other citizens who are
                            now illegally deprived of that liberty which is guaranteed to all

                        <p>“Suspicion” or “probability” has no standing in international law or

                            are equal. Therefore in this case Mr. McSweeny is entitled to the same
                            protection as if he was General Grant. What could or can be done for
                            General Grant under like circumstances can likewise be done for Mr.
                            McSweeny. One is a native citizen, the other a foreign-born citizen.
                            Therefore, I earnestly pray you to exert all the powers of the
                            government towards a speedy release of Mr. McSweeny and all other
                            American citizens now illegally languishing in British dungeons.</p>

                                lowell’s indifference</hi>.</head>
                        <p>The following letter will be found peculiarly interesting at the present
                            juncture by the readers of the Examiner, especially those of Irish birth
                            or extraction. The writer, Daniel McSweeny, was for many years a
                            well-known and esteemed resident of this city, doing business at the
                            corner of Ninth and Howard streets, where he was engaged in the cattle
                            trade. Some six years since, with his family, he returned to Ireland,
                            where he purchased some property. When the Land League was formed, as
                            might be expected, McSweeny warmly espoused the cause, and was a hearty
                            worker on its behalf. This appears to have drawn on his devoted head the
                            vengeance of the British Government. About six months ago he was
                            arrested and confined in Dundalk jail, where he now is, and from which
                            his letter is indited. Mr. McSweeny has a large family, six of his
                            children being with their mother in Ireland, and two are now residents
                            of San Francisco. Mrs. McSweeny is quite ailing, and the distress of
                            mind caused by her husband’s unjust imprisonment is rapidly undermining
                            her health. The many friends of Mr. McSweeny will, under these
                            circumstances, read his letter with mingled feelings of grief and
                            indignation. It will be seen that it is addressed to his daughter, Miss
                            Mamie McSweeny, who is at present residing in this city: <quote

                                    not answering your last two letters sooner. Since the winter set
                                    in I was unable, owing to the severe cold in this dungeon, to
                                    sit still long enough to write even a few lines. I have to keep
                                    moving about continually in my narrow space to keep from
                                    freezing. You must know how dreadful it is to be locked up
                                    eighteen hours a day in this cold, damp climate, without any
                                    fire, <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0270"/>and, worse still,
                                    we are compelled to stand or walk about daily for five hours in
                                    the open air, in a damp, muddy yard, ankle-deep in water, and
                                    then return to our cold cells, trembling with cold. It requires
                                    a strong constitution to stand it long.</p>
                                <p>I fear many of our brave fellows will succumb before the winter
                                    is over. As was only sentenced for sixteen months, I thought at
                                    first I might live it out; but you know I was in delicate health
                                    when I was arrested, being barely able to move about after a
                                    severe attack of sickness. All efforts on the part of your
                                    mother and all our friends failed to discover the cause of my
                                    arrest. I appealed to Mr. Lowell, United States minister at
                                    London, for protection, but he answered that it is absurd for a
                                    naturalized citizen of the United States to claim protection. He
                                    says that even an American citizen could only have recourse to
                                    an appeal to the courtesy of the British Government to be
                                    released. He added, in a later communication, that the British
                                    Government refused to give him any information about the charge
                                    against me, and that they snubbed him.</p>
                                <p>“Your mother wrote to Mr. Blaine about my case, but that
                                    gentleman did not deign even a reply. I heard nothing whatever
                                    from him.</p>
                                <p>“About a couple of weeks ago I saw in the English papers a report
                                    of his speech in Philadelphia, wherein he states that he is more
                                    loyal to Queen Victoria than any British subject. So it would
                                    appear that we appealed to the wrong man. I am now in jail going
                                    on seven months, charged with no crime, and not even a shadow of
                                    suspicion that I violated any law; and when our American
                                    minister asks a civil question about me he as snubbed, insulted,
                                    and his flag trampled on; but he does not appear to make much
                                    fuss about it, and the American Government takes no notice of
                                    the question any more than the King of the Sandwich Islands
                                    would. Truly, it is rather an awkward position for me. I swore
                                    allegiance to the United States, renounced my allegiance to all
                                    kings, princes, or foreign potentates forever; but most
                                    particularly to Queen Victoria, of whom it was alleged I was a
                                    subject, but which I deny: but I went through the form lest she
                                    might claim me. I have in my possession a very nice document,
                                    with the proud American eagle perched on it, purporting to be a
                                    certificate of American citizenship.</p>
                                <p>“The American Government will not recognize me. I have no claim
                                    on France, or on Russia. I have no country or government to
                                    raise its voice, while England, slowly but surely, is putting me
                                    to death; but death itself would be preferable to this
                                    torture.</p>
                                <p>“So you see now what the once proud title of American amounts to.
                                    But it is a question that should be settled. Millions in the
                                    United States should be interested in my fate, lest it might be
                                    their misfortune some day to visit their native home and find
                                    themselves cast into a dungeon and put to death without trial by
                                    judge or jury. It matters little how the question is settled so
                                    far as my case is concerned. It will not take many more days in
                                    this dungeon to settle it. Your mother, of course, will try and
                                    make her way to California with the children again. Our property
                                    will be confiscated.</p>
                                <p>“The landlord magistrates in our district have raised the poor
                                    rate to 18 per cent, on the assessed valuation of our property,
                                    while on their own it was only 2½ per cent, but they have the
                                    resources of civilization at their backs.</p>
                                <p>“There are now fifty suspects in this jail, some of whom are
                                    among the most reputable men in their respective districts. The
                                    charge against the most of them is, ‘preventing people from
                                    doing what they had a legal right to do, namely, to pay no
                                    rents.’ It looks so funny to see on their cell doors, in large
                                    letters, ‘No rent.’ We have one man from Dublin whose father
                                    died a few days ago; he applied to the authorities to see his
                                    father buried, but they answered that they ‘could not see the
                                    way to grant his request.’ And this young man does not know what
                                    he was arrested for.</p>

                    <p>[Reports his action in McSweeny’s case. On 10th June, 1881, Mr. Lowell
                        instructed the vice-consul at Belfast to ascertain the cause of <pb n="201"
                            xml:id="pg_201" facs="0273"/>the arrest, and, if innocent, to present
                        the matter in the competent quarter, and ask that McSweeny be released or
                        brought to trial. The same day Mr. Lowell asked Lord Granville to furnish
                        particulars in the case. The Irish under-secretary at Dublin meanwhile
                        informed the vice-consul at Belfast that the prisoner was reasonably
                        suspected of inciting persons to assemble unlawfully and commit riot and
                        assault. No further means of ascertaining the justice of the accusation were
                        open to the vice-consul. Later, on the 29th of June, Lord Granville informed
                        Mr. Lowell that, irrespective of the nationality of the arrested parties,
                        whether native or alien, in no case could information be given beyond the
                        statement of the warrant of arrest. Mr. McSweeny having asserted his
                        innocence, Mr. Lowell communicated this circumstance unofficially on the 8th
                        of July, and asked that the case might be considered favorably. Mr. Lowell
                        was thereupon distinctly assured that McSweeny could not be discharged from
                        custody, his conduct having brought him under the statute.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Hart, the vice-consul at Queenstown was told by the inspector
                        of police that Hart had incited to non-payment of rent, and was a dangerous,
                        good-for-nothing, troublesome character, who was perhaps involved in more
                        serious matters than those which led to his arrest. The vice-consul was
                        informed by a brother of the prisoner that the latter would not subscribe to
                        an undertaking to conduct himself according to law if he were set at
                        liberty.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lowell adds his belief that both of the prisoners are no more innocent
                        than the majority of those under arrest, and promises full statements with
                        copies of all papers by mail.]</p>

                    <p>I presume, however, that what is chiefly desired by the House is information
                        as to the arrest and imprisonment of American citizens in Ireland under what
                        is commonly called the “coercion act.” And I propose in this dispatch to
                        transmit so much of this information as has come to my knowledge with a copy
                        of the correspondence on the subject.</p>
                    <p>The act entitled “An act for the better protection of person and property in
                        Ireland,” became a law on the 2d day of March 1881. Its most important
                        provision is contained in the first paragraph of the first section, which
                        enacts that: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                committed, or of any crime punishable by law committed at any time
                                since the 30th day of September, 1880, in a prescribed district,
                                being an act of violence or intimidation, or the inciting to an act
                                of violence or intimidation, and tending to interfere with or
                                disturb the maintenance of law and order, may be arrested in any
                                part of Ireland and legally detained during the continuance of this
                                act in such prison in Ireland as may, from time to time, be directed
                                by the lord lieutenant, without bail or main-prize; and shall not be
                                discharged or tried by any court without the direction of the lord
                                lieutenant, and every such warrant shall, for the purposes of this
                                act, be conclusive evidence of all matters therein contained, and of
                                the jurisdiction to issue and execute such warrant, and of the
                                legality of the arrest and detention of the person mentioned in such
                                warrant.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The remaining paragraphs and sections relate to the form of the warrant, the
                        treatment of arrested persons, and other particulars for carrying out the
                        provisions of the act and limiting its operation to the 30th day of
                        September, 1882.</p>
                    <p>It is unnecessary to show that this law is arbitrary and severe and contrary
                        to the spirit and fundamental principles of the British constitution. This
                        is admitted by all, and by none more readily than by the government which
                        framed it and the large majority in Parliament which enacted it. But they
                        assert that the condition of Ireland was such that nothing short of an
                        extreme measure like this could meet the difficulty.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I proceed now to give an account of all the cases of arrests in Ireland, in
                        respect to which my intervention has been requested.</p>
                    <p>As early as the 12th of February, 1881, before the “coercion act” became a
                        law, Mr. M. B. Fogarty, of Knockelly, addressed to me a letter stating he
                        had been imprisoned for two months and fined because, as he averred, he
                        chanced to be in the house of his cousin the previous May, when the sheriff
                        came to evict her. He had then been released. I wrote him on the 15th of
                        February, 1881, requesting him to send me his naturalization papers and the
                        report of his trial. On the 22d he sent me his naturalization papers and
                        certain extracts from newspapers, but no report of his trial at the
                        assizes.</p>
                    <p>It appeared from the magisterial investigation that Fogarty with others was
                        in the house “at Kilburry, resisting the retaking of possession by the
                        sheriff.”</p>
                    <p>I wrote him on the 24th that his being an American citizen did not protect
                        him from the consequences of breaking the laws of the country in which he
                        was residing and that the right to a “mixed jury” which he had suggested, if
                        any such institution existed in Ireland, did not apply to his case. I stated
                        also I should not intervene except under <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203"
                            facs="0275"/>the directions of the Department of State. I inclose a copy
                        of this letter.</p>
                    <p>On the 6th of March, 1881, I received a further letter from Mr. Fogarty
                        inquiring what would be my action in case of his arrest under the “coercion
                        act.” I replied to him on the 8th of March that whenever this contingency
                        should arise I should give the matter my best attention, but that it would
                        be impossible for me to state my opinion upon a hypothetical case. I also
                        forward a copy of this letter. This is the last communication I have had
                        from this gentleman.</p>
                    <p>The next case was that of Mr. Michael Boyton, about which I have given full
                        information to the Department of State in my Nos. 140, of the 12th of March;
                        144, of the 21st of March; 147, of the 25th of March; and 154, of the 7th of
                        April, 1881, forwarding a copy of all the correspondence.</p>
                    <p>My action in this case was fully approved by the Department in its Nos. 138,
                        of the 31st of March, and 166, of the 26th of May, 1881.</p>
                    <p>The case that followed was that of Mr. Joseph B. Walsh, which was first
                        presented to me by Mr. Barrows, the consul at Dublin, on the 21st of April,
                        1881, and afterwards by the Department of State. My proceedings and
                        correspondence in this matter were fully reported in my dispatches Nos. 193,
                        of the 4th of June; 205, of 18th of June, and 218, of 15th of July,
                        1881.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoppin’s dispatch, No. 220, of the 14th November, 1881, announced the
                        release of Mr. Walsh, and forwarded a copy of his discharge.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th of May, 1881, the Department of State, by a telegram, called my
                        attention to the case of Joseph D’Alton, or Dalton, and afterwards by Mr.
                        Blaine’s dispatch, No. 168, of the 27th of May, 1881. I communicated my
                        action in this matter in my dispatches Nos. 193, of the 4th of June; 205, of
                        the 18th of June, and 218, of the 15th of July, 1881.</p>
                    <p>On the 8th of June, 1881, Mr. William Simms, the vice-consul at Belfast,
                        wrote to me in relation to Daniel McSweeney, or Sweeney, who was confined in
                        Dundalk prison, inclosing a letter from Mr. John Cormick, another from
                        McSweeney, and the latter’s naturalization certificate. I received these
                        documents on the 10th of June, and on the same day I wrote to Mr. Sims,
                        requesting him to “examine closely into the grounds” of Sweeney’s arrest,
                        and if it should appear to him that he was innocent of the charge, to make a
                        representation to the authorities and request his release or immediate
                        trial. On the same day I wrote to Lord Granville, requesting to be informed
                        of the particulars of the charge against McSweeney, and stating the latter’s
                        assertion of his entire innocence.</p>
                    <p>On the 17th of June Lord Granville informed me that this case had been
                        referred to the proper department of Her Majesty’s Government. On the 21st
                        of June Mr. Sims sent to me a letter from Mr. Burke, the under-secretary at
                        Dublin castle, stating the grounds of McSweeney’s arrest. I acknowledged the
                        receipt of this on the 24th of June.</p>
                    <p>On the 28th of June Lord Granville informed me that Her Majesty’s Government,
                        in McSweeney’s case as well as in that of Mr. Walsh, above mentioned, could
                        not recognize any distinction between the liability of foreign citizens and
                        British subjects in respect of unlawful acts committed within the limits of
                        British jurisdiction. I sent a copy of this letter in my dispatch No. 218 of
                        the 15th of July, with the correspondence relating to Walsh’s case.</p>
                    <p>On the 14th of July McSweeney wrote me a further communication <pb n="204"
                            xml:id="pg_204" facs="0276"/>from Dundalk jail, which Mr. Simms
                        forwarded to me in his letter of the 16th, and which I received on the 18th
                        of that month. Immediately upon the reception of this I addressed a private
                        and unofficial communication to a gentleman connected with Her Majesty’s
                        Government, upon whose intelligence and sense of justice I could entirely
                        rely, repeating McSweeney’s assertion, that so far from using language
                        inciting to riot, he had always advised the people whom he addressed to keep
                        within the limits of the law, and I inquired whether if this were true it
                        would not be possible to give a favorable consideration to his case. In
                        answer to this I was confidentially advised that McSweeney’s conduct had
                        clearly brought him within the provisions of the “coercion act,” and that it
                        was not in the power of Her Majesty’s Government to grant his release.</p>
                    <p>On the 17th of September, McSweeney wrote me again, demanding my intervention
                        in his behalf. As I had received no information from the vice-consul, whom I
                        had desired to examine closely into the grounds of his arrest, confirming
                        his own statements of his innocence, and as it seemed to me clear, from the
                        best examination I had been able to give to the matter, and even from his
                        own admissions, that his case was not an exceptional one, but that it
                        resembled, in its essential particulars, that of the majority of British
                        subjects arrested under the act, I wrote him on the 22d of September,
                        declining to interfere further in his favor. He wrote me another letter on
                        the 27th of September, to which I replied, and another on the 13th of
                        October last, to which I did not think proper to make any answer. I herewith
                        inclose a copy of this correspondence.</p>
                    <p>On the 17th day of June, 1881, Consul-General Badeau sent me a communication
                        from Mr. E. P. Brooks, the consul at Cork, dated on the 15th of that month,
                        covering a letter from Mr. Henry O’Mahoney, of Bally-dehob, in the county of
                        Cork, of the 12th of June, stating his imprisonment at Limerick jail, under
                        the “coercion act,” and requesting intervention to procure his release as a
                        naturalized citizen of the United States, a certificate of such
                        naturalization being forwarded with the papers.</p>
                    <p>On the 22d of June, Mr. Brooks wrote to the consul-general additional facts
                        in relation to this case; and on the 15th of July, Mr. O’Mahoney addressed
                        me directly, asking my intervention in his favor. On the 19th of July, the
                        day of the receipt of this letter, I sent my answer, stating my views,
                        generally, in respect to the rights of American citizens arrested under the
                        “coercion act.”</p>
                    <p>On the 21st of July, Mr. Brooks and Mr. O’Mahoney both wrote again, repeating
                        the latter’s request for my intervention.</p>
                    <p>On the 3d of August, I wrote to Mr. Brooks, the consul at Cork, referring in
                        particular to the case of Mr. McEnery, to be afterwards mentioned, but by
                        implication to this request of Mr. O’Mahoney, and stating my inability to
                        grant the desired favor.</p>
                    <p>A copy of this letter was sent to the Department of State with my dispatch
                        No. 235, of the 11th of August, 1881. I inclose herewith a copy of the other
                        letters relating to this case of Mr. O’Mahoney.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of Mr. McEnery, above alluded to, Mr. Brooks, the consul at
                        Cork, wrote to me on the 30th of July, as to the imprisonment of that
                        gentleman in Limerick jail, inclosing his naturalization papers, and
                        requesting my intervention. On the 3d of August, the day this letter was
                        received, I sent the reply which I have hereinabove mentioned, declining to
                        make any application on Mr. McEnery’s behalf. I communicated this
                        correspondence to the Department in my No. 235 of <pb n="205"
                            xml:id="pg_205" facs="0277"/>the 11th of August last, in which I
                        expressed the hope that my action in this case would meet with the
                        approbation of the Department. I beg to say that I have not received any
                        intimation that it was not so approved.</p>
                    <p>On the 29th of October last Mr. J. R. Tinsley, the United States consular
                        agent at Limerick, addressed a letter to Mr. Barrows, the consul at Dublin,
                        inclosing a communication for Mr. James F. Daly, who was imprisoned in
                        Limerick jail under the “coercion act,” and also his certificate of
                        naturalization, and requesting that the minister should demand for him a
                        trial or speedy release. Mr. Barrows asked for instructions in this matter.
                        Mr. Hoppin, who was at the time in charge of the legation, wrote Mr.
                        Barrows, on the 2d of November last, that if Mr. Daly could show that the
                        acts for which he had been imprisoned were of less gravity and importance
                        than those for which any British subjects had been arrested, and if his
                        incarceration had been due to mistake or misapprehension, Mr. Hoppin would
                        take pleasure in bringing his case to the attention of Her Majesty’s
                        Government, and asking for his speedy release.</p>
                    <p>No further communication in relation to this arrest has been received at this
                        legation. I inclose a copy of the material part of this correspondence.</p>
                    <p>On the 9th of December last Mr. Blaine, by his dispatch No. 285, instructed
                        me to bring the subject of the arrest of Mr. Dennis H. O’Connor to the
                        attention of the foreign office, and, upon being informed as to the facts of
                        the case, to take such action, in my discretion, as might seem to be called
                        for by the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>I received this dispatch on the 23d of December, and on the same day I
                        addressed a note to Lord Granville, to which his lordship replied on the
                        30th, stating that the matter had been referred to the proper department of
                        the government.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th of January last Lord Granville wrote to me that the government
                        would consider whether O’Connor could be discharged. A copy of these notes
                        of the 23d of December and 26th of January was sent on the 30th of January,
                        1882, with my dispatch No. 300 of that date.</p>
                    <p>On the 2d of February last I received a further note from Lord Granville,
                        acquainting me that Mr. O’Connor could not safely be released at present. I
                        forwarded a copy of this communication with my No. 305 of the 4th of
                        February.</p>
                    <p>On the 30th of January, 1882, Mr. Barrows, the consul at Dublin, addressed me
                        in relation to the case of Mr. James White, and on the 31st in relation to
                        that of Mr. Philip O’Sullivan. I answered these letters on the 2d of
                        February last, and herewith forward a copy of the correspondence.</p>
                    <p>The last of these cases which have been brought to my attention was that of
                        Mr. Michael Hart, which was communicated to me by Mr. George B. Dawson, the
                        vice-consul at Queenstown, through the consul-general at London. Mr. Hart
                        did not at that time ask my intervention, but simply desired that the fact
                        of his arrest should be noted. I replied to Mr. Dawson’s letter on the 3d
                        day of February. On the 7th of that month Mr. Merrett transmitted to me a
                        formal application from Mr. Hart for my interference on his behalf. I
                        replied to this letter on the 10th of February.</p>
                    <p>On the 13th of February last I received your instruction, No. 313, of the 3d
                        of January, in relation to this arrest, and on the 14th of February I
                        requested Mr. Dawson, the vice-consul at Queenstown, to make particular <pb
                            n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0278"/>inquiries in regard to this matter;
                        and on the 23d of February I received two letters from that gentleman, dated
                        on the 17th and 18th, accompanied by communications from Mr. Hart himself.
                        Mr. Dawson wrote me again on the 23d, covering a letter of the 22d of
                        February from Mr. Hart. I forward a copy of this correspondence.</p>
                    <p>On the 7th of February Mr. Consul Barrows wrote to me from Dublin inquiring
                        as to his future action in similar cases, and asking my instructions. I
                        herewith transmit a copy of my reply.</p>
                    <p>On the 23d of February I received Mr. Davis’s instructions, Nos. 316 and 317,
                        of the 10th of that month, the first directing me to inquire into the
                        circumstances of Mr. McSweeney’s arrest, and the second inclosing a copy of
                        a resolution of the House of Representatives on the general subject.</p>
                    <p>I have already referred to these instructions, and to my action under the
                        same, in the beginning of the present communication, and in my dispatch No.
                        322.</p>
                    <p>On the 3d of the present month I received your telegram, instructing me to
                        report immediately in relation to the cases of Messrs. McSweeney and Hart;
                        and on the 4th instant I cabled my reply, stating the action I had already
                        taken in regard to these gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>On the 5th instant I received a further telegram from you, directing me to
                        say to Lord Granville that, without discussing whether the provisions of the
                        force act can be applied to American citizens, the President hopes the
                        lord-lieutenant of Ireland will be instructed to exercise the powers
                        intrusted to him by the first section to order early trials in the cases of
                        O’Connor, Hart, McSweeney, Walsh, McEnery, and Dalton, and all other cases
                        in which Americans may be arrested.</p>
                    <p>I immediately communicated this instruction to Lord Granville, and on the 7th
                        instant I received his reply, dated on the 6th, stating that the subject
                        should receive the immediate attention of Her Majesty’s Government. I
                        herewith inclose a copy of this correspondence. I have up to this date had
                        ho further communication from Lord Granville in relation to this matter.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In concluding this dispatch I may be permitted to add that I have had
                        repeated assurances from the highest authority that there would be great
                        reluctance in arresting a naturalized citizen of the United States were he
                        known to be such. But it is seldom known, and those already arrested have
                        acted in all respects as if they were Irishmen, sometimes engaged in trade,
                        sometimes in farming, and sometimes filling positions in the local
                        government. This, I think, is illustrated by a phrase in one of Mr. Hart’s
                        letters, to the effect that he never called himself an American. He
                        endeavors, it is true, in a subsequent letter, to explain this away as
                        meaning <hi rend="italic">American born</hi>; but it is obviously absurd
                        that a man living in his native village should need to make any such
                        explanation. Naturalized Irishmen seem entirely to misconceive the process
                        through which they have passed in assuming American citizenship, looking
                        upon themselves as Irishmen who have acquired a right to American
                        protection, rather than as Americans who have renounced a claim to Irish
                        nationality.</p>
                    <p>Their view of the case is indicated in a question I made in a former
                        dispatch, No 132, of the 26th of February, 1881, from a published letter of
                        Mr. C. S. Parnell, in which he speaks of “the American people” and “the
                        Irish nation in America.”</p>

                            in my life, until on the 2d of the present month my house was surrounded
                            by an armed force and I was forcibly dragged from the bosom of my family
                            and lodged in jail.</p>
                        <p>The charge against me now is, inciting persons to unlawfully assemble and
                            commit riot and assault. Now, there was no unlawful assembly, no riot or
                            assault committed in the district from which I was arrested, neither was
                            there any incitement to commit such. The government kindly furnished me
                            with a short-hand reporter who carefully took down every word I said in
                            the English or Irish language, and I challenge him, or the government,
                            or all the landlords in Ireland, to prove that I uttered one word which
                            could by any possibility be construed to mean incitement to crime. On
                            the contrary, from every platform I advised the people to commit no
                            crime, to violate no law, but to carefully work within the lines of the
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>Now, sir, I want a fair trial; if I am innocent, I want, as an American,
                            to be released; I want to know if my naturalization papers are worth
                            preserving; whether, when an American leaves home his mouth must be
                            sealed, though slavery in its worst form should exist in every country
                            through which he may travel.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have to-day received a letter from
                            Mr. Williams Simms, the vice-consul of the United States at Belfast,
                            informing me of the arrest of Mr. Daniel Sweeney, or McSweeney, an
                            American citizen, and inclosing papers in the case. The papers include a
                            copy of the warrant of arrest, a letter from Mr. Sweeney to myself, and
                            his certificate of citizenship. It appears that he was arrested on the
                            2d instant and lodged in Dundalk jail. In his letter to me Mr. Sweeney
                            denies that he has ever said anything which could be construed into an
                            incitement to riot, and asserts that, on the contrary, he has advised
                            against the commission of crime and violation of law. I should be glad
                            to be informed of the particulars of the charge against Mr. Sweeney.</p>
                        <p>I may repeat what I said in my note of the 8th instant, with regard to
                            the case of Mr. Walsh, that my government, though anxious not to ignore
                            the just claim of American citizens to protection, has no desire to
                            embarrass the action of a friendly government in dealing with a
                            difficult and delicate domestic question.</p>

                            stated in your letter of June 18 that you had instructions from Mr.
                            Lowell to make inquiries as to the grounds of my arrest. This could have
                            been done in one day, or perhaps in one hour, for surely the Castle

                            am, in jail for over six weeks.</p>
                        <p>Please answer, and be so kind as to give me Mr. Lowell’s address.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hon. Sir</hi>: It is now more than three months
                            since I forwarded to you, through the United States consulate at
                            Belfast, my naturalization papers, with a protest against my illegal
                            arrest and detention by the British Government, and claiming, through
                            you, that protection from my own government which I had a right to
                            expect. As I am not aware that any technical point can be raised with
                            regard to my citizenship, and as sufficient time to have my papers sent
                            to San Francisco to test their genuineness has elapsed, and no action
                            taken in my case, I am led to believe that it was overlooked, unless,
                            indeed, that the delay is owing to the continued illness of our beloved
                            President. I am now fifteen weeks locked up in a British dungeon, and my
                            health is a complete wreck. I deny and defy the British Government to
                            show that I am guilty of any crime.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely hope that your excellency will demand my immediate release,
                            and urge my claim for damages for false imprisonment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the reception of
                            your letter of the 17th instant.</p>
                        <p>I have not thought it proper to make any application for your release
                            from prison for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>The coercion act, however exceptional and arbitrary, and contrary to the
                            spirit and fundamental principles of both English and American
                            jurisprudence, is still the law of the land, and controls all parties
                            domiciled in the proclaimed districts of Ireland, whether they are
                            British subjects or not. It would be manifestly futile to claim that
                            naturalized citizens of the United States should be excepted from its
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>The only case, in my opinion, in which I ought to intervene, would be
                            where an American citizen who is in Ireland attending exclusively to his
                            private business and taking no part whatever in public meetings or
                            political discussions should be arrested. Under such circumstances it
                            would be proper to appeal to the courtesy of the government here on the
                            ground of mistake or misapprehension, and ask for the release of the
                            prisoner.</p>
                        <p>I have communicated these views to the Department of State, and I have
                            received, so far, no instructions in a contrary spirit.</p>
                        <p>It does not appear to me that the reasons above given for intervention
                            exist in your case so far as I understand it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A letter bearing your signature, dated
                            from the legation of the United States, London, of the 22d instant, is
                            received by me in my prison cell in Dundalk. I am unwilling to believe
                            that this letter is the production of an American gentleman, much less
                            the American gentleman representing the United States Government at the
                            court of St. James. I cannot believe that an American gentleman would
                            treat the appeal of an American citizen in prison with contempt,
                            therefore permit me to presume that you signed the letter in question by
                            mistake, but as your signature is attached to it I may be permitted to
                            analyze it and if possible ascertain your meaning.</p>
                        <p>The reasons which you say influence you in not making an application for
                            my release are not, in my opinion, good and sufficient reasons. But I
                            will quote your own words and leave the public on both sides of the
                            Atlantic to judge.</p>
                        <p>“The coercion act, however exceptional and arbitrary, and contrary to the
                            spirit and fundamental principles of English jurisprudence, is the law
                            of the land.”</p>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0284"/>
                        <p>That the coercion act is the law of the land no one will dispute, but
                            many will be inclined to the belief that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >absence</hi> of coercive measures would be exceptional.</p>
                        <p>“It would be manifestly futile to claim that naturalized citizens of the
                            United States should be excepted from its operation.”</p>
                        <p>Here we learn for the first time that there is a distinction between
                            naturalized and native-born American citizens regarding their right to
                            claim protection abroad; but. it is evident that you are laboring under
                            a misapprehension with regard to my claim. I did <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> claim to be excepted from its operations; my claim is
                            based on the fact that I did not violate any law.</p>
                        <p>“The only case, in my opinion, in which I ought to interfere would be
                            when an Americas, citizen who is in Ireland attending exclusively to his
                            own business and taking no part whatever in public meetings or political
                            discussions should be arrested, it would be proper to appeal to the
                            courtesy of the British Government for the release of the prisoner.”</p>
                        <p>So that, in your opinion, the only right which an American citizen could
                            claim abroad would be an appeal to the courtesy of the government who
                            might deprive him of his liberty. Bat should an American be so imprudent
                            as to take part in a public meeting, say a prayer-meeting, or engage in
                            any political discussion with a Frenchman, a German, or even a Zulu,
                            according to your opinion, he would forfeit ail claim not only to
                            protection, but even to an appeal to <hi rend="italic">courtesy</hi>.
                            This throws new light on the question of American citizenship.</p>
                        <p>“I have communicated these views to the Department of State, and I have
                            received no instructions in a contrary spirit.”</p>
                        <p>Of course not; I can now understand why I and other American citizens are
                            suffering imprisonment for five or six months. But, sir, instead of
                            communicating your views to the Department of State, of my case, why not
                            communicate its facts, viz: That the British Government seized and cast
                            an American citizen into prison and sentenced him to sixteen months’
                            imprisonment, without trial by judge or jury; they refused to give any
                            reason for his arrest; that the said American had committed no crime;
                            that the fact of his having taken part in public meetings and political
                            discussions did not involve any crime, as there was no law known in
                            England at present, or until another coercion act was passed, which
                            prohibited or declared it criminal to attend and engage in such public
                            meetings; that the American dared the British Government to show that he
                            was guilty of any crime; that he demanded his release from prison and
                            claimed damages from the British Government for false imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>These, sir, are the facts in my case. I placed you in the possession of
                            these facts immediately after my arrest, and had you communicated these
                            facts to the authorities at Washington, and had they ignored my claim
                            and decided that I forfeited my right to even an appeal to the courtesy
                            of the British Government, the question of American citizenship was
                            settled once for all.</p>
                        <p>Please return my naturalization papers and copy of the warrant under
                            which I was arrested. I intend to preserve both as heir-looms, as,
                            according to your <hi rend="italic">views</hi>, one is about as valuable

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the reception of
                            your letter of the 27th instant, and in compliance with the request
                            therein contained, I herewith inclose the certificate of your
                            naturalization and the warrant of your arrest.</p>
                        <p>So far from treating your appeal for release “with contempt,” it is
                            proper for me to say that on the 10th of June last I addressed a note to
                            Lord Granville, stating your American citizenship and your denial that
                            you had ever incited any people in Ireland to riot, but, on the
                            contrary, had advised against the commission of crime and the violation
                            of law. I also stated that I should be glad to be informed of the
                            particulars of the charge against you.</p>
                        <p>Lord Granville, in his reply of the 28th of June, declined to recognize
                            any distinction between the liability of foreigners and British subjects
                            in respect of unlawful acts committed within the limits of British
                            jurisdiction. He added that the government <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213"
                                facs="0285"/>had no reason to believe that there was ground to
                            suppose that American citizens had met with exceptional treatment.</p>
                        <p>And, in another note, dated the 8th of July last, he stated, in regard to
                            my request to be furnished with particulars as to the unlawful acts
                            alleged to have been committed by Mr. Walsh, that the government could
                            make no distinction between foreigners and British subjects, and that in
                            the case of the latter the only information that could be given was that
                            contained in the warrant.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, and in the absence of any information showing
                            that your case was different from that of the great majority of others
                            where parties were arrested under the coercion act, I did not think it
                            proper to intervene any further in your behalf.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your letter of 30th September, inclosing
                            my certificate of citizenship and copy of warrant of my arrest, was duly
                            received.</p>
                        <p>If you have not treated my appeal with contempt, permit me to believe
                            that your efforts for my release from prison are, in my opinion,
                            unsatisfactory, and your reasons for non-intervention in my behalf still
                            more so. From your correspondence with Lord Granville it would appear
                            that you <hi rend="italic">did</hi> appeal to the courtesy of the
                            British Government, but that the government refused to be courteous. In
                            answer to your note of June 10 the noble lord refused to give you any
                            information. You stated that an American citizen was in prison in
                            Ireland, who denied having committed any crime, and you requested to be
                            informed of the charges against him. To this his lordship answered that
                            he could make no distinction between the liability of foreigners and
                            British subjects respecting unlawful acts committed within the limits of
                            British jurisdiction. Mark, the noble lord affects to believe that I had
                            committed unlawful acts. Here your efforts ceased as far as I was
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, sir, this was not a very strong effort on your part to plead
                            the cause of a fellow-citizen who was deprived of his liberty. You were
                            in possession of the facts in my case, and in my opinion you should
                            renew your appeal to the courtesy of the British Government. You were
                            aware that an American citizen was in prison and that he should be
                            presumed to be innocent until proved guilty. You should, also reply to
                            his lordship respecting the liability of foreigners committing unlawful
                            acts, that I had committed <hi rend="italic">no unlawful</hi> act, and
                            that I defied the British Government to prove that I had. It would
                            appear that you made another appeal to the courtesy of the British
                            Government to obtain information respecting the particulars of the
                            charge against Mr. Walsh, who, I presume, is also an American citizen,
                            but you were equally unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p>The noble lord, in his reply of July 8, declined to give you any
                            information whatever beyond that contained in the warrant of his arrest.
                            So much for appeals to the courtesy of the British Government.</p>
                        <p>Under ordinary circumstances an accredited minister of a great and free
                            country should not have been discouraged at these uncourteous replies,
                            but rather have been stimulated to renewed exertions on behalf of his
                            fellow-countryman who was held in chains by a foreign power.</p>
                        <p>Surely, sir, if you believed that Americans had any rights which England
                            was bound to respect, you could have used stronger arguments than mild
                            appeals to courtesy. You appealed to the courtesy of the British
                            Government for the particulars of the charges against American citizens
                            who were in prison and condemned without trial, and the noble lord
                            replied in effect, and said, “We have Americans in prison in Ireland; we
                            refuse to give you any information respecting the charges against them;
                            we refuse to give them trial by judge or jury; some of our spies
                            suspected them, and we promply sentenced them to eighteen months’
                            imprisonment.”</p>
                        <p>One would naturally expect that a gentleman intrusted with the important
                            mission of United States minister at the English court should at least
                            make a dignified reply to what some gentlemen occupying a similar
                            position might consider an insult. But on the contrary, sir, you seem to
                            have given up the fight, which, in my opinion, could not have been a
                            very determined one, and you sent me a message to my prison cell, where
                            I have been confined for over four months, and where I have to pass
                            eighteen hours each day in a space 6 by 12, and you tell me that you
                            have abandoned me to my fate; that you would not intervene any further
                            in my behalf. It will not be clear to the public that you did intervene
                            very far.</p>
                        <p>In the concluding paragraph of your courteous letter you say: “Under
                            these circumstances, <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0286"/>and in the
                            absence of any information showing that your case was different from the
                            great majority of others arrested under the coercion act, I did not
                            thikn it proper to intervene any further.”</p>
                        <p>Here, sir, we have your reasons for non-intervention; one the
                            circumstance of the refusal of the British Government to give you any
                            information respecting the charge. Now, that of itself would be hardly
                            considered a good reason, but looking at it from my point of view from a
                            British dungeon, the question in my mind is whether I am not still
                            justified in believing that you have treated my appeal “with contempt.”
                            Your other reason is the absence of information showing that my case is
                            different from the great majority of others arrested under the coercion
                            act. It is undoubtedly true, sir, that my case does not differ from that
                            of the great majority of others arrested under the coercion act in
                            Ireland. The great majority of the gentlemen in prison are as guiltless
                            as I am; they are gentlemen incapable of committing crime; they are not
                            in prison for crime, but for their political opinions. But, sir, you
                            must remember that they are Irishmen, and that they have no government
                            to appeal to for protection. My case is not exceptional. But with equal
                            justice you say to an American who should happen to be captured by some
                            savage chief of the Cannibal Islands, and sentenced to be eaten, “Oh,
                            sir, your case is not exceptional; there are others to be devoured as
                            well as you. I do not think it proper to intervene.”</p>
                        <p>British subjects took part in public meetings and political discussions
                            in the United States during the slave troubles. Had the American
                            Government cast them into prison and sentenced them to a term of
                            imprisonment without trial and refused to give the British minister at
                            Washington any information respecting the charge against them, what
                            would the British minister do “under these circumstances?” Fold his
                            arms, take the matter good-naturedly, send a message to the British
                            subjects in prison that he “did not think it proper to intervene,” or
                            demand his passport?</p>
                        <p>Yours, respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: About two weeks ago I received a
                            “personal” letter from Mrs. Bridget O’Mahoney, of Ballydehob, county
                            Cork, Ireland, informing me of the arrest of her husband, Mr. Henry
                            O’Mahoney, under the coercion act, and requesting interference on my
                            part to secure for him a speedy trial, &amp;c., on the ground that he is
                            an American citizen.</p>
                        <p>I treated this communication, and several others that followed from the
                            same source, as personal and unofficial, and explained to Mrs. O’Mahoney
                            that no interference by me could possibly effect the result she sought.
                            At the same time I offered any assistance I could properly and legally
                            render in the premises. In due course she forwarded to me a certificate
                            of her husband’s naturalization to be a citizen of the United States, a
                            copy of which is inclosed herewith.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I made inquiries in a private way regarding O’Mahoney’s status,
                            from which I am led to infer that he possibly went to the United States
                            last year for the purpose of taking out the naturalization papers
                            referred to. I think it quite probable that very soon I will have
                            positive proof of the truth of this inference. Of course, any further
                            inference as to O’Mahoney’s proceedings must be based upon whatever
                            additional proof I may obtain regarding his intentions in renewing his
                            citizenship in the United States after the lapse of sixteen years since
                            his alleged service in the American Navy.</p>
                        <p>I add that he was one of the most popular of the Land League leaders in
                            his country-side, and that during the “famine” of 1880 was very
                            efficient in relieving the distress of his neighbors.</p>
                        <p>From this stand-point he was most assuredly a reputable person, and one
                            of whom every one in the locality of his “home,” as he calls it, at
                            Ballydehob, speaks in terms of highest praise.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, or viewed from the stand-point of the police
                            authorities, he appears to have been a very violent, unscrupulous, and
                            dangerous agitator.</p>
                        <p>This statement is the result in brief of my personal and unofficial
                            investigation of the case, during which I have carefully avoided saying
                            or doing anything calculated to commit myself or the Government of the
                            United States. Now, however, I am in receipt of a letter, a copy of

                        <p>Personally appeared in open court Henry O’Mahoney, late of Ireland, and
                            made application upon his petition to be admitted a citizen of the
                            United States of America; and it appearing to the satisfaction of this
                            court that he, the said applicant, is of the age of twenty-one years and
                            upwards, and that he did, on the 19th day of October, 1864, enlist as a
                            soldier in the Navy of the U. S., on board of the U. S. S. Sybil, in the

                            citizens of the United States, that the said applicant has resided

                            one year and upwards previous to his application as aforesaid;</p>
                        <p>And it further appearing to the satisfaction of this court that during
                            that time the said applicant has behaved as a man of good moral
                            character, and attached to the principles of the Constitution of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the matter of the application of Henry
                            O’Mahoney, political prisoner, now in Her Majesty’s jail at Limerick, in
                            this consular district, for assistance or protection based upon the
                            claim that he is a citizen of the United States, I have to report the
                            following additional facts:</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday, the 21st instant, with the permission of F. McG, Eager, esq.,
                            governor of the prison, I had a very lengthy interview with O’Mahoney in
                            the governor’s office. I had previously intimated in a personal way to
                            Mr. Macarthy, president magistrate at Limerick, the time and purpose of
                            this interview, and had invited him to be present at it as a
                            representative of Her Majesty’s Government. He was not present, however,
                            until the interview had been nearly concluded.</p>
                        <p>The purport of O’Mahoney’s statements was, in brief, as follows:</p>
                        <p>He was discharged from the United States Navy in the fall of 1865, and
                            had lost his discharge papers. Subsequent to his discharge he remained
                            in the United States, living in Kansas, Missouri, and the Mississippi
                            Valley until 1874, when he returned to Ireland. During this period, in
                            1866, he made application to the county court, Caddo Parish, Shreveport,
                            La., for his naturalization papers, basing his application upon his
                            service in the Navy. The papers were not issued; the reason for which
                            failure to issue he did not state.</p>
                        <p>His return to Ireland in 1874 was occasioned by the “hard times” then
                            prevailing in the United States, and because he had lost money by bank
                            failures as well as failures of contractors for whom he had worked as a
                            subcontractor in the erection of saw-mills. He remained in Ireland two
                            years, and returned again to the United States in 1876, but returned to
                            Ireland soon after. He was married in Ireland in 1875, and in October of
                            that year obtained a license under the local laws to keep a “public
                            house;” <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi>, as a retailer of liquors,
                            spirits, &amp;c., &amp;c. This house and license his wife has kept and
                            used at Ballydehob ever since, and still keeps and enjoys the same. In
                            1879 he returned to the United States and went to Lockport, N. Y., and
                            from thence to Buffalo.</p>
                        <p>In February, 1880, he applied for and obtained naturalization papers in
                            Lockport, a copy of the certificate of which was forwarded inclosed in
                            my dispatch to you under date of June 15 instant.</p>
                        <p>In January, 1881, he returned to Ireland, for the purpose, as he most
                            emphatically declared, of disposing of his property in Ballydehob and
                            going with his family back to Lockport, where, he says, he now owns a
                            small property. After his last arrival at Ballydehob he took part in the
                            then prevailing political agitation, and being a ratepayer (tax-payer
                            and voter), was urged by his neighbors to stand as a candidate for <hi
                                rend="italic">poor law guardian</hi>. He objected to this, but was
                            finally duly nominated, elected, and qualified, after which he entered
                            upon and discharged the duties of his office up to the time of his
                            arrest and incarceration.</p>
                        <p>He added that he knew the orifice of poor law guardian was one of
                            important trust if not of emolument, and that the discharge of its
                            duties involved the assessment and levy of taxes (striking rates), and
                            the practical administration or execution of the laws of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>To the qnestion, “What demand or claim do you wish to prefer or ask of
                            the United States Government?” he answered, “I demand and claim
                            protection the same as the British Government gave to its subjects in
                            New York during the draft riots in the late war. I am an American
                            citizen, and want to get out of this country. I want a fair trial; I
                            want justice and a speedy trial, and I want the protection of the
                            American Government to secure these things to me.”</p>
                        <p>To the further question, “Suppose the British Government were to permit
                            your release from prison upon condition of your immediate return to the
                            United States, would you accept such terms?” he replied. “I cannot
                            promise that, for it would take a year to close up my affairs here and
                            sell out my property; but I do not want to stay in this country, and am
                            willing and anxious to leave it as soon as I can.”</p>
                        <p>O’Mahoney further explained that the foregoing statement of dates or
                            years may not be technically correct, and that he gave it from memory,
                            to the best of his recollection and belief.</p>
                        <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0289"/>
                        <p>In conclusion he repeated his request for the immediate interference of
                            the United States authorities in his behalf.</p>
                        <p>To conclude the record in O’Mahoney’s case it is necessary to state that
                            he stands committed under the so-called “coercion act” as a suspect, on
                            suspicion of having been implicated in an assault with fire-arms, with
                            intent to kill, upon Mr. George Henry Swanton, justice of the peace,
                            Gortnagrough, Ballydehob.</p>
                        <p>I have to add that before I left the prison I was informed that two or
                            more prisoners were anxious to see me for the purpose of preferring
                            claims similar to those of O’Mahoney’s. In response to this information,
                            I declared my willingness to take cognizance of their cases upon proper
                            application in due form.</p>
                        <p>As I have received no instructions up to date in O’Mahoney’s case from
                            the legation or other source, I shall, unless otherwise directed, permit
                            the matter to drop here.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: As I am a suspect here for some time,
                            I forwarded my papers of citizenship about the 18th of June to Ed. P.
                            Brooks, United States consul at Queenstown, and demanded protection, and
                            he said he would attend to it; and in a note from a friend from
                            Queenstown to-day he (Mr. Brooks) requested that I should write to the
                            ministry at St. James in reference to my application for protection. I
                            arrived in this country about the last of January for the express
                            purpose of collecting a lot of money due to me here, and was fully
                            intended to go to the States this fall in order to get into the apple
                            trade. I certainly say that during my time at home previous to my arrest
                            I was never guilty of any offense punishable by law, and I respectfully
                            ask if I cannot be protected in this country long enough to collect my
                            debts, and by obeying the laws, such as I always have, to allow me as
                            many days as possible in preparing to depart for America; and although
                            it is very hard on me to go without collecting my debts, yet I shall
                            receive it as an everlasting favor done me under the circumstances. An
                            early reply will much oblige,</p>

                            that an American citizen should not be exempt from the penalties of a

                                    the United States Government, through you, is a trial, in order
                                    that I may show that there is exceptional injustice practiced in

                                    myself innocent of the charge that I am accused of, but of any
                                    other crime punishable by law, except being a member of the Land

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, addressed to the minister of
                            the United States, covering another from J. R. Tinsley, esq., United
                            States consular agent at Limerick, which inclosed a communication from
                            Mr. James F. Daly, and his certificate of naturalization as a citizen of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>It appears that Mr. Daly has been arrested under the so-called “coercion
                            act,” and is now detained at Limerick jail. He desires that the minister
                            should demand for him a trial or speedy release, and you ask for
                            instructions in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lowell went to the continent upon a leave of absence more than three
                            weeks since and will not return until early in December.</p>
                        <p>In a communication which was addressed to you on the 1st of September
                            last, in relation to the case of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Lowell stated the
                            reasons why, in his opinion, he should not intervene on behalf of
                            American citizens arrested under the coercion act, unless under
                            extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. I have good grounds to
                            believe that these reasons are not disapproved of by the Department of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>I fully agree with Mr. Lowell in this view of our diplomatic duties. If
                            no distinction has been made to the disadvantage of the prisoner on the
                            ground of his nationality, and if British subjects are being imprisoned
                            for no more illegal acts than those which he has committed, it seems
                            that, however arbitrary and despotic we may consider the coercion act to
                            be, we are nevertheless obliged to submit in silence to the action taken
                            under it by the authorities, even against our own fellow-citizens.</p>
                        <p>So long ago as the year 1848, when certain citizens of the United States
                            were arrested and confined in Newgate prison, Dublin, under the law
                            suspending the habeas corpus, Mr. Buchanan in his instructions to Mr.
                            Bancroft said, “If this law, arbitrary and despotic as it is, had been
                            carried into execution in the same impartial manner against the citizens
                            and subjects of all foreign nations this government might have submitted
                            in silence.” It was the fact that a distinction was made to the
                            disadvantage of American citizens that was the ground of intervention in
                            that case.</p>
                        <p>It is useless for us to apply to Her Majesty’s Government for a statement
                            of the dates, places, and other details of the specific acts alleged to
                            have been committed by Mr. Daly, upon which the warrant for his arrest
                            was issued. We have already asked for similar information on other
                            occasions, and have been told that Her Majesty’s Government consider
                            that no distinction can be made in these circumstances between
                            foreigners and British subjects, and that in the case of the latter the
                            only information given is that contained in the warrant. We have,
                            therefore, to look elsewhere for such information.</p>
                        <p>If Mr. Daly can show satisfactorily that the acts for which he has been
                            imprisoned are of less gravity and importance than those for which any
                            British subjects have been arrested; that he has been attending
                            exclusively to his private affairs in Ireland, without taking part in
                            political meetings or party disturbances, and that his incarceration is
                            due to mistake and misapprehension, I shall take great pleasure in
                            bringing his case to the attention of Her Majesty’s Government and
                            asking for his speedy release.</p>
                        <p>I herewith return Mr. Tinsley’s and Mr. Daly’s letters, and the latter’s
                            naturalization certificate.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir. &amp;c.,</p>

                            being guilty.” My warrant was issued “by his excellency’s command,” and
                            signed “W. E. Foster, chief secretary to the lord lieutenant.”</p>
                        <p>I now, sir, through you, claim with confidence the protection of my
                            government, asking that you would demand that I be either at once sent
                            to trial or immediately released from my imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient and faithful servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have your letter of the 30th ultimo in
                            relation to the case of Mr. James White, who is confined in Naas jail
                            under the so-called “coercion act,” and inclosing his certificate of
                            naturalization and two letters written by him to you on the 23d and 28th
                            of January last.</p>
                        <p>I have also your letter of the 31st of January in relation to the case of
                            Mr. Philip O’Sullivan, who is confined in the same prison under the same
                            act, and inclosing his certificate of naturalization and a letter from
                            him to yourself, dated on the 30th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>Both of these gentlemen claim protection on the ground of being citizens
                            of the United States, and you ask me for instructions in their
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>In a communication which I addressed to you on the 1st of September last,
                            in relation to the case of Mr. Joseph B. Walsh, I stated my opinion to
                            be that the fact of being an American citizen confers upon a person no
                            immunity from arrest and imprisonment under the “coercion act,” and that
                            the only occasions on which I could properly intervene in behalf of such
                            persons would be: <list>
                                <item>First. Where such person, being in Ireland in the prosecution
                                    of his lawful private business, and taking no part in political
                                    meetings or partisan disturbances, has been arrested by obvious
                                    mistake; and</item>
                                <item>Secondly. Where a distinction has been made to the
                                    disadvantage of the prisoner on the ground of his American
                                    nationality.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If British subjects are being arrested for no more illegal acts than
                            those which the prisoner is charged with having committed, or of the
                            intention to commit which he is justly suspected, it seems that, however
                            arbitrary and despotic we may consider the “coercion act” to be, we are,
                            nevertheless, bound to submit in silence to the action taken under it by
                            the authorities even against our own fellow-citizens.</p>
                        <p>It should be observed that this act is a law of the British Parliament,
                            the legitimate source and final arbiter of all law in these realms, and
                            that, as it would be manifestly futile to ask the government here to
                            make an exception on behalf of an American who had brought himself
                            within the provisions of any law thus sanctioned, so it would be
                            manifestly unbecoming in a diplomatic representative, unless by express
                            direction of his superiors, to enter upon an argument with the
                            government to which he is accredited as to the policy of such a law or
                            the necessarily arbitrary nature of its enforcement.</p>
                        <p>I must repeat, therefore, in the cases of Messrs. White and O’Sullivan,
                            the substance of what I wrote to you in the case of Mr. Walsh, that
                            unless these gentlemen can produce to me satisfactory proof that they
                            have been arrested under an evident mistake of the facts, or have been
                            treated with exceptional severity on account of their being American
                            citizens, I must decline to intervene on their behalf.</p>
                        <p>I herewith return their certificates of naturalization and the
                            accompanying letters.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. I. Hart, of Carrigtwohill, near
                            Queenstown, called on me to-day and stated as follows:</p>
                        <p>His brother, Michael Hart, is at present under arrest in Clonmel jail
                            under the inclosed warrant. He is a naturalized citizen of the United
                            States, and has sent me his certificate of naturalization for
                            inspection.</p>
                        <p>I. Hart is anxious to have his brother released, and asked for my advice.
                            I recommended him to get his brother to write to the chief secretary,
                            Dublin Castle, stating that he is a citizen of the United States, and
                            that if freed from arrest that he will conduct himself properly and
                            peaceably while in this country and will conform to its laws. Hart
                            thought it advisable to notify the nearest consul of his being in jail,
                            in consequence of having seen a paragraph in a newspaper that the
                            President of the United States had been requested to ascertain the
                            number of Americans under arrest in Ireland.</p>

                            letter of the 1st of February instant, covering two communications from
                            B. H. Barrows, esq., the United States consul at Dublin, addressed to
                            me, and also a letter to yourself from G. B. Dawson, esq., the
                            vice-consul at Queenstown, the letter in relation to the case of Michael
                            Hart, who is imprisoned in Clonmel jail under a warrant which
                            accompanied Mr. Dawson’s letter.</p>

                            intervention by me on his behalf. They address you in order that the
                            fact of Mr. Hart’s being an American under arrest in Ireland may be
                            communicated to the Government of the United States. In case I shall be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the reception of
                            your letter of the 8th instant, in relation to the case of Michael Hart,
                            now imprisoned in Clonmel jail, and its inclosures, viz, a letter from
                            Mr. Dawson, United States vice-consul at Queenstown; one from Mr. Hart
                            to Mr. Dawson, and Mr. Hart’s certificate of naturalization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hart has been arrested under the so-called “coercion act,” and he
                            appears to think that the fact of his being an American citizen entitles
                            him to immediate release.</p>
                        <p>This is not, however, my opinion. The principles upon which I have based
                            my action in all cases of applications like that of Mr. Hart’s are those
                            upon which our government has acted and in case of need would act
                            again.</p>
                        <p>I think it important that all such persons should be made to understand
                            distinctly that they cannot be Irishmen and Americans at the same time,
                            as they seem to suppose, and that they are subject to the operation of
                            the laws of the country in which they choose to live.</p>
                        <p>The vice-consul at Queenstown should inform himself of the facts in Mr.
                            Hart’s case, and ascertain whether there be any peculiar hardship in it
                            which would make it an exception, calling for immediate and energetic
                            protest. In that case it would be necessary for him to send me a full
                            statement of the case, with whatever confirmatory or illustrative
                            evidence it is possible to obtain. But if his case is like that of the
                            ordinary “suspects,” I see no reason why I should intervene.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You will have received from Mr. Merritt a
                            copy of my letter to him upon the subject of Mr. Michael Hart’s
                            imprisonment in Clonmel jail. Since the date of that letter I have
                            instructions in relation to this case which make it desirable that I
                            should ascertain the particular facts and circumstances which led to his
                            arrest. Will you, therefore, be kind enough to inquire and report to me
                            what you can learn about this matter? Has Hart been conspicuous in any
                            way in using his influence to prevent the payment of rent? What has he
                            done that he should be selected for arrest? It is hardly possible that
                            it was a purely arbitrary proceeding. It is unnecessary for me to
                            suggest that these inquiries should be conducted with all proper
                            discretion.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            your dispatch dated February 14.</p>
                        <p>I proceeded this morning by car to Carrigtwohill, which is distant from
                            here about six miles, and called on the head constable at the police
                            station. He said that it would be contrary to rules to give me any
                            information as to the cause of Michael Hart’s arrest, and advised me to
                            see the sub-inspector of police at Middleton, four miles beyond
                            Carrigtwohill. I then drove to Middleton and had an interview with Mr.
                            Creagh, sub-inspector of the district. I told him my object in calling
                            was to get some information about Michael Hart, who was arrested by him
                            at Ballintubber, near Carrigtwohill; that Hart had applied to me for
                            advice and protection, and in consequence I wished to know the cause of
                            his arrest. Mr. Creagh said it was not his duty to give any information
                            on such a subject. I replied that I did not want or expect him to put me
                            in possession of any facts that would be improper or injudicious to
                            give, but it was my duty when a citizen of the United States applies for
                            advice or protection to inquire <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0296"
                            />fully into the circumstances. I then mentioned that I had already
                            advised Mr. Hart to give an undertaking to conduct himself in conformity
                            with the laws if released. I asked Mr. Creagh if Hart had taken a
                            prominent part at land-league meetings, or if he had been inciting
                            people not to pay rents. I also mentioned that I had received from Mr.
                            Hart a copy of the warrant under which he was arrested, also his
                            certificate of citizenship, and had sent both to you, and that it was
                            your desire to be made aware, as far as possible, of the actual causes
                            which led to Hart’s arrest.</p>
                        <p>He then told me that Hart had been the cause of much trouble in the
                            neighborhood of Ballintubber by inciting people to withhold rents, and
                            that he seemed to be under the impression, because of his being an
                            American citizen, that he might advise and incite his neighbors to
                            disobey the laws of this country. He further said that Hart would not
                            have been arrested unless sufficient proof had been given that he was
                            guilty of the charges specified in the warrant.</p>
                        <p>I then asked if he thought the authorities would grant Hart’s release
                            provided he would give the undertaking which I have previously
                            mentioned. He replied that the district is now quiet and the farmers are
                            paying their rents, and he fears that Hart’s return may again cause
                            trouble, but if he would give a proper undertaking for his good conduct,
                            or return to the United States, that the police authorities would not
                            put any impediment in the way of his release.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Creagh considers Hart to be a worthless, troublesome, and dangerous
                            person. He is also of opinion that Hart has been concerned in other
                            matters of perhaps even a more serious nature than that for which he is
                            now imprisoned.</p>
                        <p>I called upon the parish priest of Carrigtwohill, but he was unable to
                            give me any further information.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I received your letter of the 14th
                            instant, together with my certificate and copy of letter for his
                            excellency, and you want to know is there any special or peculiar
                            hardship in my case. Well, I maintain that my conduct was always
                            peaceable and in accordance with the laws of the country, and I think no
                            greater hardship could be done to me than to ram me into prison without
                            showing cause for same. Because a certain man in my neighborhood did not
                            get as much rent-money as formerly, he satisfies himself by taking my
                            liberty away and sending me to goal.</p>
                        <p>I think Mr. Lowell mistakes when he says I can’t be an Irishman and:
                            American at the same time. I never pretended to be an American, and I am
                            not ashamed to be born in Ireland. I do think the main cause of the
                            majority of suspects is for taking part or being members of an
                            association called the Land League, which was proclaimed illegal here
                            some time ago, and I want Mr. Lowell distinctly to understand that I
                            never became a member of that assiociation, neither did I ever
                            contribute one penny towards it, and until it is proved in some shape or
                            form that I at any time did do any act contrary to the law of the
                            country I am living in, I will maintain that a greater injustice was
                            never done to any man.</p>
                        <p>If Mr. Lowell thinks he has no right to intervene in my case he is at his
                            own option to do so. As far as my humble opinion is, the charge laid
                            against me in warrant is not a charge punishable by the law of his
                            country. When the constitution was suspended here in Ireland, I was not
                            surprised to get an order from Dublin Castle, for I knew perfectly well
                            some of the landlord class in this country have a terrible hatred
                            towards America, or any one who had ever been there, and I had no
                            alternative but to <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0297"/>sacrifice my
                            expenditure and business, and clear out to America or be at their mercy,
                            and I choose the latter rather than show cowardice, and am prepared to
                            sacrifice my prospects and health in preference to my principles. I am,

                            if the truth of his mind was known he have very little sympathy for me

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose a copy of a
                            letter received to-day from Mr. Michael Hart.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday last Mr. Hart, of Carrigtohill, brother of Michael Hart, called
                            on me. I Informed him of the fact of my having had an interview with the
                            chief of police at Mi die ton, and that I was under the impression his
                            brother would be released provided he would sign the undertaking which I
                            advised him to offer.</p>

                            to sign any pledge for his future conduct or to accept release, except
                            unconditionally.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a letter from my brother he tells me
                            you don’t understand my letter or know what I am going to do. If I have
                            said in my letter to you that I was not an American, and did not mean to
                            be one, I was referring to the copy of his excellency’s, where he said
                            he wanted me to understand that I could not be an Irishman and an
                            American at the same time, and perhaps that is how I said I did not mean
                            or pretend to be an American, and my motive in making that remark was I
                            never meant to be an American born, or went under the pretense of being
                            one, and that I was not ashamed to be born in Ireland. But, though being
                            a foreign-born citizen of the United States, I think I have a right to
                            claim all the rights and protection while in a foreign country which is
                            accorded to native-born citizens; and as to informing you what I was
                            going to do I don’t know that myself. If my health will permit, when
                            released from here, my stay will be very short in this country, and I
                            think it’s hardship enough to be put behind bar and halt in an English
                            prison when pursuing my daily avocations in a law-abiding manner,
                            without showing further causes of hardship.</p>
                        <p>I return you my sincere thanks for the interest you are taking and the
                            trouble you have given yourself in my case.</p>

                            government has acted, and in case of need would act again. I think it
                            important that all such persons should be made to understand distinctly
                            that they cannot be Irishmen and Americans at the same time, as they now
                            seem to suppose, and that they are subject to the operation of the laws
                            of the country in which they choose to live.</p>
                        <p>You should inform yourself of the facts in each case as it arises, and
                            ascertain whether there be any peculiar hardship in it which would make
                            it an exception calling for immediate and energetic protest. In that
                            event it would, of course, be necessary to send me a full statement of
                            the case, with whatever confirmatory or illustrative evidence it was
                            possible to obtain. In all other cases, it would be enough if you report
                            to me names, dates, and charges in each case, and guide yourself in your
                            answer to applications for protection by the instructions already

                        <p>“Referring to the cases of O’Connor, Hart, McSweeney, Walsh, McEnery, and
                            Dalton, American citizens imprisoned in Ireland, say to Lord Granville
                            that, without discussing whether the provisions of the force act can be
                            applied to American citizens, the President hopes that the lord
                            lieutenant of Ireland will be instructed to exercise the powers
                            intrusted to him by the first section, to order early trials in their
                            and all other cases in which Americans may be arrested.”</p>
                        <p>In transmiting this dispatch to your lordship, I venture to hope that,
                            considering the importance of the matters to which it refers, it may

                            Ireland, on the charge of being “reasonably suspected.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. White was for two years a member of the city council of Denver,
                            Colorado, and is said to be a peaceable, quiet man, well-disposed
                            towards good government. He left Denver about the 22d day of July, 1878,
                            and returned to Ireland for the purpose of visiting his aged father and
                            staying with him the remainder of his life. Very respectable parties in
                            Denver offer to vouch for the intelligence, sobriety, and integrity of

                    <p>Mr. West has asked me this morning to use my good offices to secure to
                        William Lane, a British subject, held in Detroit prison for trial, the trial
                        which he asserts he is unable to obtain. I have telegraphed to the
                        attorney-general of Michigan to inquire into the facts in order that they
                        may be fully reported to Mr. West, and have said that the President desires
                        that he will use his best endeavors to secure to Lane the early trial which
                        Lane asserts he cannot obtain.</p>
                    <p>In informing Lord Granville of this you may say that we are still without the
                        information respecting the trials in the Irish cases which your telegram of
                        last week led us to expect, and that the President hopes that Her Majesty’s
                        Government will see its way to an early and favorable answer.</p>

                    <p>[Mr. Lowell reports the conclusion arrived at by the British cabinet, which
                        has been put in the form of a memorandum by Lord Granville, as follows:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The communications which have been made by Mr. Lowell as to the
                                “suspects” in Ireland alleged to be American subjects involve
                                principles of such importance that Her Majesty’s Government consider

                                the imprisonment of the suspects under the act of last year is not a
                                measure of punishment, but of prevention. * * *]</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: From the tenor of your telegram of the 20th
                        instant, I learn that six American suspects are still detained in prison. Of
                        these six cases three, viz, O’Mahoney, McSweeney, and McEnery, had been
                        previously made known to the department. The cases of Slattery, Brophy, and
                        Gannon are now made known to us for the first time.</p>
                    <p>It appears from documents on file in this department, that O’Mahoney in 1866
                        made application in Louisiana for naturalization under the soldiers’ act
                        (Revised Statutes, section 2166) and was refused, for what cause is not
                        stated. He then returned to Ireland, where he remained. In October, 1875, he
                        went into business as a keeper of a public house and retailer of liquors, at
                        a place called Ballydehob. This business has been carried on in his name
                        since 1875. In 1878 he came to the United States of America, and obtained
                        naturalization there in February, 1880, without stopping his business in
                        Ballydehob. He then returned to Ireland, where he was and still is a
                        rate-payer, tax-payer, and voter, and offered himself as a candidate for
                        poor-law guardian. He was elected, qualified, and entered upon the discharge
                        of the duties of the office, and ‘ was discharging them when arrested. His
                        imprisonment under his present arrest dates from November last.</p>
                    <p>On this statement it cannot be denied that O’Mahoney is a citizen of the
                        United States. The assurance which the ordinary processes of naturalization
                        give to the United States that its citizenship is sought with a purpose of
                        forming part of its population, and contributing to its wealth and its
                        strength, is waived in this statute, and that great privilege is conferred
                        for the sole consideration of a year’s service in its military <pb n="231"
                            xml:id="pg_231" facs="0303"/>forces. And although that alleged service
                        had been rendered fifteen years before the naturalization, and although the
                        person seeking the naturalization had abandoned the country and was in
                        business in a foreign land, and holding office there with every apparent
                        purpose of remaining there permanently, the language of the act seemed to
                        leave the court no discretion to refuse the decree when it was once proved
                        that the applicant had enlisted in the armies of the United States, that he
                        had been honorably discharged therefrom, and that he had resided more than
                        one year in the United States previous to his application.</p>
                    <p>In this statement I make no account of the fact that O’Mahoney informed the
                        consul at Cork that his alleged service was in the Navy. If his statement to
                        the consul was correct, his alleged naturalization was fraudulent and in
                        violation of law under the settled rulings of this government. This precise
                        point has been decided by the district court of the United States for the
                        district of Oregon. (In re Bailey, 2 Sawyer’s Reports, 200.)</p>
                    <p>Assuming, however, that the naturalization was within the letter of the law,
                        the President is of the opinion that it was only just within the letter, and
                        that it was wholly outside the spirit and intent of the naturalization laws.
                        We generously welcome aliens within our folds with the expectation that they
                        are really to become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh; that they are
                        to cast their lots in with us, and that the fruits of their industry are to
                        form part of our national wealth. But when an alien is at the very time of
                        his naturalization, and for years before has been, a resident and
                        office-holder in the country of his origin, when after Ms naturalization he
                        puts his certificate in his pocket and returns to the country of his origin,
                        and continues to reside there in business and holding office, the President
                        feels it to be his duty to afford to such a citizen only the measure of
                        protection demanded by the strictest construction of duty, namely, that he
                        shall receive from the hands of the government under which he is holding
                        office the measure of protection which it affords to its own citizens or
                        subjects.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McSweeney was naturalized many years since and resided in San Francisco,
                        engaged in the cattle trade. About six years ago he returned with his family
                        to Ireland and purchased some property there. For the last six years he has
                        been residing there, and it is understood that he also is holding office as
                        a poor-law guardian with an apparent purpose of remaining in Ireland. He is
                        a gentleman of influence and appears to have taken a prominent part in the
                        troubles which are now agitating Iceland. He says that his action has been
                        that of a peaceable citizen and within the line of the law. The British
                        authorities maintain that they have good right to suspect him of inciting
                        persons unlawfully to assemble together and to commit riot and assault. It
                        is understood that the British authorities are ready to release him if he
                        will leave Ireland.</p>
                    <p>The President has carefully considered this case also. When a naturalized
                        citizen resumes his residence with his family in the land of his origin, and
                        goes into business there, and becomes an office-holder, and takes active
                        part in political discussions, if it turns out that his action gives offense
                        to the local government, and he is thrown into prison, the laws and
                        interests of the United States do not require us to do more than insist that
                        he shall have a right to return to the country of his adoption, leaving the
                        question of damages for future discussion.</p>
                    <p>Such is understood to have been the course pursued by the United States
                        during the late civil war. In September, 1862, the British, <hi
                            rend="italic">chargé d’affaires</hi> at Washington requested the
                        discharge of one Francis <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0304"/>Carroll, a
                        British subject, who had been arrested by the military authorities in
                        Baltimore. Mr. Seward refused the request, and in a note to Mr. Stuart said:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Is the Government of the United States to be expected to put down
                                treason in arms and yet leave persons on liberty who are capable of
                                spreading sedition? * * *</p>
                            <p>Certainly the government could not expect to maintain itself if it
                                allowed such mischievous license to American citizens, Can the case
                                be different when the dangerous person is a foreigner living under
                                the protection of this government? I can conceive only one ground
                                upon which his release can be ordered, and that is that he may be
                                too unimportant and too passionate a person to be heeded in his
                                railings against the government. But you will bear in mind that the
                                times are critical, and that sedition is easily moved now by
                                evil-designing men who in times of peace might be despised.

                    <p>A correspondence ensued, which resulted in a proposal that— <quote

                            <p>Mr. Carroll should be released from custody upon his agreeing to
                                leave the United States immediately, and not return again during the
                                continuance of this rebellion and giving security to the approval of
                                the United States marshal that he will keep said agreement.

                    <p>This offer was accepted by the British <hi rend="italic">chargé
                            d’affaires</hi> and Mr. Carroll was discharged.</p>
                    <p>The President cannot assume that an exercise of national sovereignty which
                        was performed by the United States when their security was assailed cannot
                        be performed by other powers similarly situated, subject, of course, always
                        to be questioned when the good faith of its exercise may be drawn in
                        doubt.</p>
                    <p>But in the exercise of such an extreme right of sovereignty the comity of
                        nations demands that the power exercising it should hold itself ready at all
                        times to explain to the power on whose citizens it has been exercised the
                        reasons which have compelled it. It cannot be doubted that Her Majesty’s
                        Government will observe the same spirit of courtesy in this respect that the
                        Government of the United States displayed when the case was reversed. You
                        will therefore inquire of Lord Granville why these two prisoners are
                        detained, and if it should appear that we are correctly informed as to their
                        history and as to their active participation in the local politics of
                        Ireland, and you are assured that they may leave the country at any moment
                        they please, you will communicate these facts to the Department and await
                        further instructions.</p>
                    <p>As to the prisoner McEnery, it is understood here that he was arrested last
                        June on suspicion of being concerned in an assault and in breaking into a
                        dwelling. It is now nearly a year since this arrest was made, and, making
                        due allowance for the exceptional condition of Ireland, the President is of
                        opinion that the time has come when Her Majesty’s Government should frankly
                        state why he is held and when he may have an opportunity of defense. The
                        President, on entering upon the duties of his office on the death of
                        President Garfield, was ignorant of these arrests and of their nature. My
                        attention was not called to them when I took charge of the Department. It
                        was not until I had been here some weeks that the friends of the prisoners
                        brought the real facts to my knowledge. Since then, under direction of the
                        President, I have spared no effort to have this matter properly adjusted. I
                        am bound to say that our exertions have been met in a spirit of friendship
                        by Her Majesty’s Government; but it assumes as the basis of its action a
                        principle to which the President cannot assent. In his note of the 6th
                        April, to Mr. West, Lord Granville quotes with approval the following
                        extract from a note of the 14th October, 1861, from Mr. Seward to Lord
                        Lyons: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>In every case subjects of Her Majesty residing in the United States
                                and under their protection are treated, during the present troubles,
                                in the same manner and with no greater or less rigor than American
                                citizens.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0305"/>
                    <p>And he deduces from this the principle that “no distinction can be made in
                        favor of aliens” or, as stated to yourself in a note of the 28th June last,
                        that Her Majesty’s Government would not admit— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Any claim to exemption on behalf of any person, whether alien or
                                citizen, from the operation of the laws which equally affect all
                                persons residing in the domain and under the protection of the
                                Crown.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Mr. Seward’s statement was rather an allegation of a fact than the
                        enunciation of a principle. But if it can be taken to be the statement of a
                        principle as broad as Lord Granville now lays down, the President cannot but
                        look upon it as an extreme position taken in the heat of conflict, to which
                        the government of neither Great Britain nor the United States can give
                        adhesion in time of quiet and reflection. It is certain that Her Majesty’s
                        Government did not accept it as a rule of action during the civil war, and
                        as certain that Mr. Seward did not adhere to it, but permitted exceptional
                        inquiries, as in Carroll’s case and Mc-Hugh’s case and the cases of the
                        military commission in Fort Lafayette, to be made throughout the war. Lord
                        Lyons was constantly and diligently asking the causes of arrest and
                        imprisonment of British subjects, and Mr. Seward was as constantly answering
                        his inquiries, notwithstanding the fact of the suspension of the <hi
                            rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi></p>
                    <p>It is not the interest of either government to be drawn into an extreme
                        position in this delicate matter. The President concedes that he has no
                        right to expect to transfer into foreign countries the forms of law which
                        under American institutions are so great a security to the citizen. He
                        concedes to every sovereign power the right to prescribe its own code of
                        crimes and its own mode of trying offenders, and if it shall choose to adopt
                        a system which gives the citizen fewer guarantees against injustice than
                        prevail in the United States he feels that he cannot complain if it is
                        applied to citizens of the United States who are found where it
                        prevails.</p>
                    <p>But if, when thus applied, it works actual injustice; if it takes possession
                        of an American citizen, and deprives him of his liberty without any
                        allegation of offense; if it leaves him incarcerated without hope of trial
                        or chance of release, it then becomes the duty of the President to inquire
                        why this is done. Her Majesty’s Government pursued that course during the
                        civil war. They will see that a self-respecting government must do the same
                        now. And the President can have no doubt that when you, under these
                        instructions, courteously, but firmly, ask to be informed why McEnery is
                        deprived of his liberty and why he is afforded no opportunity of defense,
                        Her Majesty’s Government, instead of referring you to the municipal law of
                        Great Britain, which authorizes such treatment of British subjects, will at
                        once give you with frankness and fullness the information you ask for. As
                        soon as it is obtained you will cable the substance.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the other persons, of whom we now hear for the first time, I
                        understand that as to one or more of them there is some doubt as to the
                        citizenship.</p>
                    <p>In the present excited state of Ireland you will, as I doubt not you have
                        hitherto done, exercise due caution and scrutiny to make sure that persons
                        have the right to claim your protection. In a country where the ordinary
                        course of law is suspended there is danger that unworthy and designing
                        persons, who are not American citizens, will seek to put on our nationality.
                        American citizenship is a great privilege, not to be lightly put on or
                        unworthily worn. Its assumption implies the promise and the obligation to
                        observe our laws at home, and peaceably as good citizens to assist in
                        maintaining our faith abroad, <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0306"
                        />without efforts to entangle us in internal troubles or civil discord with
                        which we have not, and do not wish to have, anything to do. When an American
                        citizen thus conducts himself, whether at home or abroad, he is entitled to
                        the confidence of his government and active support of all its officials. If
                        business interests or the ties of affection take him into lands where from
                        any cause laws which protect him from arrest and imprisonment do not exist,
                        his government claims the right to interpose its own shield to take the
                        place of the protection which is denied by local laws.</p>
                    <p>The President is aware that Ireland is now in an exceptional condition. But
                        even if all be true which is stated; if it is impossible to conduct a trial
                        by jury of a breaker of the peace with any hope of conviction even with the
                        clearest proof; if the witness who testifies against such an offender does
                        it with his life in his hands if it be impossible for owners of property to
                        collect rents under any process of law 5 if those who are responsible for
                        the administration of law in Ireland are seeking to do away with this
                        unhappy condition—even if all this be true, it furnishes no sufficient
                        reason why an American citizen should remain incarcerated without
                        accusation, without chance of trial, without opportunity for release. The
                        President is gratified to observe that the claim thus to hold American
                        citizens is modified by the following language in Lord Granville’s
                        instruction of April 6th to Mr. West: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The Irish Government have in many instances released prisoners upon a
                                reasonable belief that it could be done without risk to the public
                                safety, and I need hardly say that Her Majesty’s Government are not
                                desirous of detaining unnecessarily in prison any person from whom
                                no danger to the public peace is to be apprehended.</p>
                            <p>They will therefore be prepared to consider the circumstances of any
                                citizens of the United States now detained who may be willing to
                                engage forthwith to leave the United Kingdom.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The President moreover has little doubt that Her Majesty’s Government do not
                        intend to insist in practice upon the extreme doctrine that an American
                        citizen against whom there is no charge shall, without trial, remain in
                        prison or leave the United Kingdom. But he believes, by fairly considering
                        each case as it arises, conclusions will be reached satisfactory to both
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>After satisfying yourself that the three persons whose names are now reported
                        to us are citizens, you will ask Her Majesty’s Government why they are
                        detained, and whether it is contemplated to give them trials, reporting by
                        cable; and should your intervention or protection be claimed by others
                        hereafter, you will be governed by the rules and principles laid down in
                        this dispatch.</p>
                    <p>You are instructed to read this instruction to Lord Granville and to leave a
                        copy of it with him if he desires it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that since my last
                        dispatch on the subject of the persons claiming to be naturalized citizens
                        of the United <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0307"/>States now Imprisoned
                        in Ireland, I bad an interview, by appointment, with Mr. Forster on Friday,
                        21st April, the results of which I have already communicated in substance by
                        telegram. I assented that he should try the experiment of offering their
                        release to all the so-called American suspects on condition of their going
                        back within a reasonable time to the country they claim to have adopted, but
                        I distinctly informed him that I was not authorized by my government to
                        accept anything less than unconditional liberation, On my part I promised to
                        have the prisoners informed, on my own responsibility alone, that “in case
                        they should be released” forty pounds sterling should be at the disposal of
                        each to pay his passage across the Atlantic. I accordingly instructed
                        Messrs. Barrows and Wood, consuls respectively at Dublin and at Belfast; and
                        Mr. Tinsly, consular agent at Limerick, to visit the prisoners and make
                        known to them the offer. Two of them, McInerny and Slattery, were allowed
                        three days to consider whether they would accept or not; the others,
                        O’Mahoney, Gannon, and McSweeney, refused to be liberated on any terms
                        whatever. Under whose advice or orders they were acting is a matter of very
                        probable conjecture.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile it is nearly certain that all the suspects, except those charged
                        with crimes of violence, will be very shortly set at liberty, thus rendering
                        nugatory the most effective argument in favor of disorder and resistance to
                        the law. * * *</p>

                            had, as consular agent of the United States at-Limerick, received
                            authority to pay him forty pounds sterling for his passage to the United

                            payment was to be conditional upon his leaving this country for America,
                            to which I replied that I presumed it was. But to satisfy them I read

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                            yours of the 21st. In obedience to your instructions to “see William
                            Brophy” I called upon the under secretary and asked, for an order
                            directed to the governor of Naas jail which would allow me to see Brophy
                            privately. The courtesy was at once accorded me, and on yesterday I
                            proceeded to Naas. Governor Gildea gave me a private room, where I saw
                            Brophy, who, in the course of conversation, remarked that if released he
                            could not undertake to leave under three or four months; that his
                            mother-in-law died last May intestate, and that he and the other
                            relatives are unable to agree on executors or administrators; that he
                            came to Dublin from New York in 1877; returned to America once for about
                            six months; does not deny that he was a Fenian in 1867, but declares
                            positively that <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0309"/>lie is not
                            concerned in the present movement in any way whatever, nor does he
                            belong to any society or organization; that he has five children, the
                            youngest only five weeks old, his wife a delicate woman and unable to
                            travel. He stated, finally, that he had no desire or intention of
                            remaining in Ireland after the settlement of his private affairs, but he
                            refused absolutely to accept release on the condition of his leaving for
                            America.</p>
                        <p>His decision is emphasized by inclosed telegram, which I received from
                            him this morning, wherein, you will observe, he refuses anything but
                            unconditional release.</p>

                            to-day, I did so, and had an interview with them. They said as it was to
                            benefit their health they came to Ireland, and neither of them feeling
                            well, they would not be disposed at present to return to the United

                            was authorized, as an act of kindness, to pay to each of them the amount

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the proceedings
                            taken under the instructions of your letter of the 21st instant, in
                            respect of the communication to be made to Henry O’Mahoney and Daniel
                            McSweeney, now confined respectively in Her Majesty’s prisons at
                            Monaghan and Dundalk. The letter was received by me at so late an hour
                            on Saturday, the 22d instant, as made it impracticable to reach either
                            of the two places on that day, and no communication was available on
                            Sunday. I was not able to go in person. Mr. Samuel P. Brown, a consular
                            clerk, holding the commission of the President, and now on duty at this
                            consulate, was accordingly delegated by me, under suitable instructions,
                            to perform the service. He left Belfast on Monday morning, the 24th
                            instant, and returned last evening. A copy of the report of his
                            proceedings is herewith submitted. I have every reason to believe that
                            the object of your instructions was most discreetly and faithfully
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>In the event that either O’Mahoney or McSweeney should be liberated, I

                            your letter, unless I shall be otherwise instructed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with your instructions, I
                            left Belfast at 9 a. m., on Monday, the 24th instant, for Monaghan, and
                            arrived there about 12 m. I at once proceeded to Her Majesty’s prison
                            and requested an interview with the prisoner Henry O’Mahoney. The warden
                            of the prison received me with courtesy, and at once sent for Mahoney. I
                            then communicated to the latter the statement of Mr. Lowell’s letter.
                            Mahoney seemed undecided whether he would accept the terms implied in
                            that communication as to his departure for America. It did not appear
                            that he had any information that he had been or was to be pardoned.</p>
                        <p>On leaving Monaghan I was obliged, in order to reach Dundalk that
                            evening, to drive to Clones. On reaching Dundalk it was too late for an
                            interview with the prisoner Daniel McSweeney, but I was able to arrange
                            for an interview on the following morning. This took place about 11
                            o’clock a. m. Before making Mr. Lowell’s communication to McSweeney, he
                            at once said that he would not accept his liberation on the condition of
                            returning to the United States.</p>
                        <p>In both these cases the prisoners observed that the departure for the
                            United States was a condition of their liberation, although no
                            communication beyond the words of Mr. Lowell’s letter was made. The
                            warder at Dundalk gave me a copy of a letter, dated the 24th instant,
                            from Dublin Castle (which is hereto appended), advising him of the
                            liberation of McSweeney on condition of his leaving Ireland for the
                            United States. I was advised that it had not, at the time of my
                            interview, been made known to McSweeney.</p>
                        <p>In view of the indecision of O’Mahoney and the declaration of McSweeney
                            as to the acceptance of liberation on the condition of proceeding to the
                            United States, I informed them, agreeably to your instructions, that the
                            consul at Belfast would carry out Mr. Lowell’s instructions as to the
                            payment of the money to each of them in case they were liberated by Her
                            Majesty’s Government, provided he should not in the mean time receive
                            instructions revoking his authority in this respect.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The case of John R. McCormack, a prisoner in
                        Clonmel jail, who asserts his American citizenship, and sends me a
                        certificate of naturalization bearing the name of John McCormiek, is one of
                        those that will still embarrass me with the question of continuous domicile,
                        even should he succeed in establishing his identity with the person named in
                        the certified extract from the record of the justice’s court of the district
                        of Troy, New York, on which he bases his claim for my intervention in his
                        behalf.</p>
                    <p>The date of the certificate of naturalization is the 25th October, 1867. A
                        letter from Mrs. McCormack informs me that her husband returned to Ireland
                        in 1869, and has continuously resided there ever since (with the exception
                        of a visit to the United States in 1873) as the publisher and editor of a
                        local newspaper.</p>
                    <p>The United States have from the first justly insisted on and have finally
                        established the principle of the right of expatriation; but when a man has
                        completed the process of expatriating himself and returns to the land of his
                        birth, I should be glad to be instructed how far his residence there may be
                        prolonged without extinction of the acquired and revival of the original
                        allegiance; over how many years may the <hi rend="italic">animus
                            revertendi</hi> be reasonably considered elastic enough to stretch; and
                        what kind or continuity of business pursuit may be supposed to establish the
                            <hi rend="italic">animus manendi.</hi></p>
                    <p>In treaties with the North German Confederation and with Würtemberg, <pb
                            n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0312"/>the United States have agreed to
                        consider two years as the reasonable limit beyond which a continuous
                        residence in his native country by the naturalized citizen of another will
                        be considered as establishing the <hi rend="italic">animus manendi</hi>.
                        Some of the decisions of the court seem to imply a much shorter period.</p>
                    <p>In the cases of most, if not all, the so-called American suspects in Ireland,
                        continuous residence has exceeded this term; in some it has greatly exceeded
                        it; in the case of McOorraack it has apparently extended to thirteen years-
                        I cannot help thinking that the British Government would be justified in
                        questioning the final perseverance (if I may borrow a theological term) of
                        adopted citizenship under adverse circumstances like these.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I beg to bring under your notice that
                            I am an American citizen, suffering imprisonment under the English
                            coercion act. I am guiltless of any crime punishable by law, and what I
                            request is that, in pursuance of a resolution passed by the United
                            States legislature, you use your office in securing for me that
                            protection which I claim as a citizen of the United States, and that
                            justice which, only through your government, I can obtain. If the
                            government of this most unhappy country has a charge against me, all I
                            ask is that I be brought to trial and given a chance of refuting the
                            charge before one of the legal tribunals of the country. If there be no
                            charge against me other then, perhaps, that of fallacious suspicion,
                            founded upon the whisper of an <hi rend="italic">ambitious</hi>
                            policeman, or grounded on the <hi rend="italic">elastic</hi> information
                            of a hireling informer, then I think it is no more than ordinary justice
                            to demand my release or my trial. It is not necessary, however, that I
                            should here enter into a discussion of the injustice which I am
                            suffering at the hands of a rather strange government and the action,
                            nay the duty, of that magnanimous government which you represent, and
                            which I have sworn to maintain. For the present I think it sufficient to
                            inform you of my position, and to request that you will see to it.</p>

                            my American citizenship, and beg to request that you will lose no time
                            in forwarding it to Mr. Lowell. I lost the original document, and in
                            consequence of your reply tome last February, I neglected sending for a
                            duplicate until the 20th ultimo. I trust that Mr. Lowell will lose no
                            time in representing my case, as I am now undergoing my fourth month’s
                            imprisonment without the slightest shadow of a charge against me. Of
                            course my business as a journalist and newspaper proprietor is suffering
                            severely through this most wanton outrage perpetrated on me by the
                            British Government, and I think it would be nothing more than ordinary
                            justice that Mr. Lowell should demand compensation for me for the losses
                            which I have sustained. I shall expect at least that my trial or
                            unconditional release will be demanded forthwith. Surely four months
                            should be time enough for the British authorities to trump up a charge
                            against me if they could, but I defy them to do so.</p>
                        <p>It might be necessary for me to explain the slight difference between the
                            name under which I was arrested and that in my certificate of
                            citizenship. The name under which I was arrested is John R. McCormack,
                            the R being used by me from my mother, whose name is Ryan, in order to
                            distinguish me from several John McCormacks in Tipperary, amongst them
                            three first cousins of my own. Of course I am prepared to prove that I
                            am the actual person mentioned in the inclosed duplicate.</p>

                    <p>My <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>: Referring to the interview which your
                        lordship was kind enough to grant me on the 3d instant, in relation to the
                        case of Joseph B. Walsh, arrested under the coercion act at Castlebar,
                        County Mayo, on the 8th March last, I have now the honor to request that you
                        would at your convenience furnish me, in order to my better understanding of
                        the facts of the case, with a copy of the warrant under which he was
                        arrested, and with such particulars as to the offense with which he is
                        charged as may be within your knowledge, Mr. Walsh having furnished me with
                        evidence satisfying me that he is a naturalized citizen of the United
                        States, though I have no reason to think that Her Majesty’s Government were
                        aware of the fact when the warrant was issued. As your lordship will observe
                        by the dates, Mr. Walsh has already suffered a three months’ imprisonment,
                        to the manifest detriment of his affairs; and the President, while anxious
                        not to embarrass in any way the action of a friendly government in dealing
                        with a very difficult and delicate question of domestic policy, cannot but
                        also feel solicitous not to ignore any just claim of American citizens to
                        his intervention in their behalf.</p>

                    <p>My <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>: I have to-day received a letter from Mr.
                        William Simms, the vice-consul of the United States at Belfast, informing me
                        of the arrest of Mr. Daniel Sweeney, or McSweeney, an American citizen, and
                        inclosing papers in the case. The papers include a copy of the warrant of
                        arrest, a letter from Mr. Sweeney to myself, and his certificate of
                        citizenship. It appears that he was arrested on the 2d instant, and lodged
                        in Dundalk jail. In his letter to me Mr. Sweeney denies that he has ever
                        said anything which could be construed into an incitement to riot, and
                        asserts that, on the contrary, he has advised against the commission of
                        crime and the violation of law. I should be glad to be informed of the
                        particulars of the charge against Mr. Sweeney. I may repeat what I said in
                        my note of the 8th instant with regard to the case of Mr. Walsh, that my
                        government, though anxious not to ignore the just claim of American citizens
                        to protection, has no desire to embarrass the action of a friendly
                        government in dealing with a difficult and delicate domestic question.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Lowell informed me on the 3d instant that he had received instructions
                        from his government by telegraph to make representations to me on the
                        subject of a naturalized American citizen who had been arrested in Ireland
                        on the 8th of March last, to ask what was the crime for which he had been
                        arrested, and to press for his being brought to trial.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lowell added that he had been promised that fuller instructions on the
                        subject should be sent him by mail.</p>
                    <p>I answered that such representations took me much by surprise, considering
                        the circumstances of the case and the understanding which existed between
                        the two countries on this point of international law; but 1 added that, as
                        he expected fuller instructions, it would be better to await their arrival
                        before discussing the question.</p>
                    <p>I now transmit for your information a copy of a letter which I have received
                        from Mr. Lowell, in which, he requests to be furnished with certain
                        particulars connected with the arrest, under the act for the better
                        protection of person and property in Ireland of the 2d March, 1881, at

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch of the 17th instant,
                        in which I communicated to you a copy of the letter addressed to me by Mr.
                        Lowell, requesting that he might be furnished with certain particulars
                        connected with the arrest in Ireland, under the peace preservation (Ireland)
                        act, 1881, on the 8th March last, of Mr. Joseph B. Walsh, who is said to be
                        a naturalized citizen of the United States, I now propose to place before
                        you the considerations which, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government,
                        justify them in declining to recognize any distinction between the liability
                        of foreigners <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0316"/>and British subjects
                        in respect to unlawful acts committed within the limits of British
                        jurisdiction, or to admit any claim to exemption on behalf of any person,
                        whether alien or citizen, from the operation of the laws which equally
                        affect all persons residing in the dominions and under the protection of the
                        Crown.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I wish to observe that Her Majesty’s Government have not
                        failed to note the friendly assurances given on the part of the President of
                        the United States towards this country, as contained in Mr. Lowell’s letters
                        of the 8th and 10th instant when applying for information with regard to the
                        arrests in Ireland, under the act already cited, of Messrs. Walsh and
                        Sweeney.</p>
                    <p>The right of every State to subject foreigners within its limits, no less
                        than its own subjects, to every law made for the maintenance of law and
                        order is an undisputed principle of the law of nations, and is a right
                        necessarily inherent in the sovereignty of every independent community.</p>
                    <p>The principle is universally recognized, and is well stated by the great
                        French jurist Portalis, as quoted by Sir Robert Phillimore in his
                        “Commentaries upon International Law,” vol. 1, cap. xviii, section 334, p.
                        454:</p>
                    <p>“Chaque État a le droit de veiller à sa conservation, et c’est dans ce droit
                        que réside la souveraineté. Or, comment un État pourrait il se conserver et
                        maintenir, s’il existait dans son sein des hommes qui pussent impunément
                        enfreindre sa police et troubler sa tranquillité? Le pouvoir souverain ne
                        pourrait remplir la fin pour laquelle il est établi, si des hommes étrangers
                        ou nationaux étaient indépendants de ce pouvoir. Il ne peut être limité, ni
                        quant aux choses, ni quant aux personnes. Il n’est rien s’il n’est tout. La
                        qualité d’étranger ne saurait être une exception légitime pour celui qui
                        s’en prévaut contre la puissance publique qui régt le pays dans lequel il
                        réside. Habiter le territoire, c’est se soumettre à la souveraineté.”</p>
                    <p>The principles thus stated apply alike to exceptional laws which the
                        necessities of state have caused to be imposed, and to the action of the
                        ordinary tribunals.</p>
                    <p>Foreigners, whether the native-born or naturalized subjects of their own
                        state, are equally amenable to the laws for the time being in force in the
                        country in which they are resident.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that in the dispatch of the 18th December, 1848 (British
                        and Foreign State Papers, vol. xlvii, p. 1242), Mr. Buchanan, the United
                        States Secretary of State, admitted that the application of the law
                        suspending the writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> was one to which
                        his government might have “submitted in silence” if it “had been carried
                        into execution in the same impartial manner against the citizens and
                        subjects of all foreign nations.”</p>
                    <p>But on the occasions to which attention has now been called by Mr. Lowell
                        there is no room for complaint of any exceptional treatment in the case of
                        American citizens.</p>
                    <p>In the correspondence in 1866 between the British Government and the United
                        States, the true light from which the matter is to be regarded was set forth
                        very clearly in the statement made by Mr. Seward in his confidential
                        dispatch to Mr. Adams, the substance of which will be found in Lord
                        Clarendon’s dispatch to Sir F. Bruce of the 14th April, 1866.<note n="*"
                            xml:id="d132fn1">See appendix.</note> Mr. Seward then said that he
                        “frankly admitted that Americans, whether native-born or naturalized, owe
                        submission to the same laws in Great Britain as British subjects, while
                        residing there and enjoying the protection of the British Government;” and
                        Mr. Seward added that “the United States Government had applied the converse
                        of that principle to British subjects who were sojourning or traveling in
                        the United States during the late rebellion.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Seward, no doubt, here referred to the discussion which took place
                        between the two governments in the year 1861, when the writ of <hi
                            rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> was suspended by the Executive of its
                        own authority in America.</p>
                    <p>This correspondence will be found in the British and Foreign State Papers,
                        1860–’61, vol. li, pp. 241, 243, 252, 264.</p>
                    <p>The principle was then admitted on both sides that if such a proceeding was
                        lawfully authorized (as it has been, without question, in the case of
                        Ireland), no complaint could be made if, under its principles, the subjects
                        of foreign states were treated in like manner, or, as Mr. Seward expressed
                        it in his letter to Lord Lyons of the 14th October, 1861 (p. 245), “with no
                        greater or less rigor” than the citizens of the country in which such an
                        exceptional law had become duly operative.</p>
                    <p>(<hi rend="italic">Vide</hi> also the correspondence in the case of Mr. Shaw,
                        British and Foreign State Papers, 1864–’65, vol. lv, p. 710.)</p>
                    <p>Having regard to the fact that amongst the most mischievous and dangerous
                        attempts against peace and order in Ireland are those due to Irishmen who
                        have become naturalized in America, it would be, in the opinion of Her
                        Majesty’s Government, most highly impolitic to admit, either in principle or
                        practice, any departure from the doctrine of their equal liability to the
                        procedure which it has been found necessary to apply in the case of the
                        subjects of the Queen.</p>
                    <p>Nothing could be more injurious than the belief that Irish-American citizens
                        could carry on lawless projects in Ireland covered by an exceptional
                        immunity.</p>
                    <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0317"/>
                    <p>If that were permitted, they would become the principal agents in the crimes
                        which it was the object of the act 44 Vict., cap. 4, for the protection of
                        person and property in Ireland, to suppress.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I transmit, for your information, a copy of the reply which I
                        am about to return to Mr. Lowell’s applications of the 8th and 10th instant,

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with the request contained in
                        your letter of the 8th instant, I have now the honor to forward a copy of
                        the warrant under which Mr. Joseph B. Walsh, who is said to be a naturalized
                        citizen of the United States, was arrested at Castlebar, County Mayo,
                        Ireland, on the 8th March last.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s Government have also had under their consideration the
                        application made by you on the 10th instant, requesting to be furnished with
                        particulars of the charge under which Mr. Daniel Sweeney, or McSweeney, an
                        American citizen, had been arrested on the 2d June, and lodged in Dundalk
                        jail.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, I beg leave to assure you that Her Majesty’s Government
                        are very sensible of the friendly feeling toward this country, and of the
                        appreciation shown by the President of the United States with regard to the
                        difficulties presented by the abnormal condition of affairs at this moment
                        in a portion of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>It will not, I trust, be necessary to enter at great length upon the reasons
                        which, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, prevent them from
                        recognizing any distinction between the liability of foreigners and British
                        subjects in respect of unlawful acts committed within the limits of British
                        jurisdiction, or from admitting any claim to exemption on behalf of any
                        person, whether alien or citizen, from the operation of the laws which
                        equally affect all persons residing in the dominions and under the
                        protection of the Crown.</p>
                    <p>It will, it is hoped, suffice to refer to the dispatch written on the 18th
                        December, 1848 (see British and Foreign State Papers, vol. xlvii, p. 1242),
                        to Mr. Bancroft by Mr. Buchanan, where he admits that the application Of the
                        law suspending the writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> (11 and 12
                        Vict., cap. 35) was one to which his government might have “submitted in
                        silence” if it “had been carried into execution in the same impartial manner
                        against the citizens and subjects of all foreign nations.”</p>
                    <p>On the present occasion Her Majesty’s Government have no reason to believe
                        that there is ground to suppose that American citizens have met with
                        exceptional treatment.</p>

                        Joseph B. Walsh was arrested at Castlebar, county Mayo, Ireland, in the
                        month of March last. It appears by the copy of a certificate <pb n="246"
                            xml:id="pg_246" facs="0318"/>sent to me that Mr. Walsh was duly admitted

                        the year 1875, to be a citizen of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>I have been instructed by Mr. Blaine to make the necessary inquiries into the
                        cause of Mr. Walsh’s arrest and detention, and I should feel much obliged to
                        your lordship if you could furnish me with a statement of the dates, places,
                        and other details of the specific acts said to have been committed by Mr.
                        Walsh, upon which it was thought proper to issue the warrant in

                        between foreigners and British subjects, and that, in the case of the
                        latter, the only information given is that contained in the warrant.</p>

                    <p>My <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>: I have the honor to acquaint you that I
                        have to-day received a letter from Mr. B. H. Barrows, the consul of the
                        United States at Dublin, inclosing a communication, dated the 30th ultimo,
                        that had been made to him by Mr. Joseph B. Walsh, a prisoner arrested under
                        the protection act, and confined in Kilmainham jail.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Walsh is a naturalized citizen of the United States, and I was instructed
                        some time since to inquire into the circumstances of his arrest. My action
                        in his case, and in other similar cases, is still the subject of
                        correspondence between myself and my government. Whatever may be the final
                        decision in regard to this, Mr. Walsh’s statements in his letter to Mr.
                        Barrows are such that it is proper I should lose no time in communicating
                        them to your lordship. He says that his health is very much impaired, and
                        that further imprisonment would be dangerous to his life. He desires that a
                        medical examination may be made into the truth of his statement.</p>
                    <p>I should be much obliged to your lordship if you would make such
                        representations to the proper authorities as to cause this to be done, and
                        to have this man liberated from prison if practicable.</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0319"/>
                    <p>It is proper to add that Mr. Blaine, in his instructions to me upon his
                        arrest, says that Walsh’s “character as a law-abiding and good citizen is
                        vouched for by well-known and respectable citizens of Pennsylvania.”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have received to-day from Mr. Blaine a
                        dispatch stating that Mr. P. C. O’Connor, of Baltimore, Md., has informed
                        the Department of State that his brother, Mr. Denis H. O’Connor, a
                        naturalized American citizen, has, without cause, been arrested and
                        imprisoned by the British authorities in Ireland on suspicion of being in
                        sympathy with the Irish National Land League.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaine incloses a copy of the certificate of the naturalization of Denis
                        H. O’Connor, and also of a letter from P. C. O’Connor above mentioned, by
                        which it appears that the said Denis went to Ireland about four years ago,
                        and engaged in general drapery business in Charleville, in the county of
                        Cork, under the firm name of O’Connor and Malony, and in Kilmallock,
                        Limerick County, under the firm name of D. H. O’Connor and Co. It is further
                        stated that his incarceration, if continued, may prove fatal, as his health
                        is not good, and may also injure him financially, as he is at the head of
                        the two business establishments, with all his means at present in the hands
                        of strange clerks and salesmen.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Blaine instructs me to bring this subject to
                        the attention of your lordship, with the request that I may be informed as
                        to the grounds upon which Mr. O’Connor was arrested and imprisoned.</p>

                        resolution to the following effect:</p>
                    <p>“That the President be requested to obtain from the British Government a list
                        of all American citizens, naturalized or native-born, under arrest or
                        imprisonment by authority of said government, with a statement of the causes
                        of such arrest or imprisonment, especially of such citizens as may have been
                        thus arrested and imprisoned under a suspension of <hi rend="italic">habeas
                            corpus</hi> in Ireland, and, if not imcompatible with the public
                        interest, that he communicate such information as he receives, together with
                        all the correspondence now on file in the Department of State relating to
                        any existing arrest or imprisonment of citizens as aforesaid;” upon which
                        Mr. Robinson, of New York, made a violent speech, copy of which is herewith
                        inclosed, against the British Government, and said, alluding to the
                        prohibition of the importation of hogs into England from America some time
                        ago, which created so much sensation, “Oh! that we only paid as much
                        attention, as much honor, to a live American citizen as we do to a dead
                        Cincinnati hog!” I called Mr. Frelinghuysen’s attention to the terms of this
                        resolution, and to the language used in debate upon it, but he said he had
                        no knowledge of any such resolution as I had now alluded to, and which I
                        showed to him, nor could he tell me what was likely to be the ultimate fate
                        of it. I remarked to Mr. Frelinghuysen that, although not much importance
                        need be attached to such language as that used by Mr. Robinson, still the
                        wording of the resolution was calculated to produce a bad effect, and might
                        cause unnecessary irritation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen said he would make inquiries as to what had taken place in
                        the committee respecting the resolution.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Robinson, of New York, took the floor to discuss the resolution. He
                            related how, some months ago, he had met the late English minister, and
                            how that gentleman had stated to him that some American hogs of bad
                            character had been taken over to England for consumption. The wires
                            under the Atlantic had flashed the news of outrages that were about to
                            be perpetrated upon the dead Ohio hog. At the same time, American
                            citizens, who bad fought upon the battle-fields of the Union, whose
                            blood had given additional redness to the Stripes and brightened the
                            glory of the Stars, were thrown into prison without any crime being
                            alleged against them, were tried as felons, and were without any
                            opportunity to get their cases before the Government or the people of
                            the United States. He (Mr. Robinson) had been led to exclaim: “Oh, that
                            we only paid as much attention, as much honor, to a live American
                            citizen as we do a dead Cincinnati hog!” But so it was. The State
                            Department would not call up the cases of those citizens and have them
                            examined. There were five American citizens now confined in British
                            bastiles. They had been seized, brought before a jury, tried, and
                            acquitted; but immediately afterward the suspension of the <hi
                                rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> had been brought to bear, they had
                            been rearrested, and were now languishing in prison. He had endeavored
                            to get the cases of these moaning, sickened, dying American citizens
                            before this House, but until the present time had been unable to do so.
                            He was going to move an amendment to the report, and was going to take
                            higher ground than was there taken. Not only had the United States a
                            right to interfere in behalf of American citizens in British prisons,
                            but it had the right, and it was its duty, to demand the release of the
                            members of Parliament elected by the people of Great Britain, and whom
                            the British Government had imprisoned. “A gentleman here,” continued Mr.
                            Robinson, “shakes his head. I will shake his heart.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Robinson then quoted from a speech delivered by Lord John Russell in
                            favor <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0322"/>of the British Government
                            interfering to compel the release by the Tuscan Government of certain of
                            its own subjects. Russian despotism hid its head, Turkish tyranny paled
                            into insignificance and grew pygmyish in comparison with the great wrong
                            and tyranny and despotism that had been inflicted on some of the people
                            of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>At this point the matter went over until Tuesday, when it will come up as
                            unfinished business.</p>

                    <p>With reference to my dispatch of the 25th ultimo, I have the honor to inform
                        your lordship that the House of Representatives, after a long debate,
                        adopted the resolution reported from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the
                        terms of which are as follows:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">“Resolved</hi>, That the President be requested to obtain a
                        list of American citizens, naturalized or native-born, under arrest or
                        imprisonment in Great Britain by authority of said government, with a
                        statement of the cause or causes of such arrest and imprisonment, and
                        especially of such citizens as have been thus arrested and imprisoned under
                        the suspension of the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> in Ireland, and
                        that he communicate such information, when received, to this House, together
                        with all correspondence now on file with the Department of State relating to
                        any existing arrest and imprisonment of citizens as aforesaid.”</p>
                    <p>I do not think it necessary to trouble your lordship with comments on the
                        abusive speech of Mr. Robinson, of New York, in support of his amendment, to
                        which no importance was attached, but at the same time 1 would remark upon
                        the fact of the resolution having been adopted, as showing the importance
                        attached to conciliating the Irish vote.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Orth, of Indiana, however, stated, in support of the resolution which he,
                        as a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, reported back to the
                        House, that it was one simply of inquiry, calling upon the State Department
                        to furnish to the House such information as may be accessible in reference
                        to alleged wrongs committed against certain American citizens within the
                        jurisdiction of the British Government, adding that sundry petitions and
                        memorials to this effect which had reached the committee formed the basis of
                        it. In this sense the House adopted the resolution, whereupon Mr. Orth moved
                        to reconsider the vote by which it was adopted, and also that the motion to
                        reconsider be laid on the table.</p>

                        on the subject with as little delay as practicable. As there are many such
                        cases of arrest and imprisonment, of which I cannot conveniently obtain the
                        particulars excepting through the kind offices of your lordship, I
                        respectfully ask that you will cause me to be furnished with the information

                    <p>With reference to my dispatch of the 1st instant, I have the honor to inform
                        your lordship that the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
                        Representatives having reported adversely a further resolution offered by
                        Mr. Robinson, of New York, respecting the arrest of American citizens in
                        Ireland, it was “tabled” (tantamount to its death-blow) by a majority of 117
                        to 102. This resolution was to the following effect:</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the Attorney-General of the United
                        States is hereby directed to communicate to this House his opinion, in
                        writing, on the following question:</p>
                    <p>“If Joseph Warren Keifer, Speaker of this House, or Alonzo B. Cornell,
                        governor of the State of New York, or Charles Carroll, a laborer in the
                        department of public works in the city of New York, being a citizen of the
                        United States, visit any part of the British Empire, and should there be
                        arrested without having committed any crime, and without any definite charge
                        of crime being alleged against him, could the English Government, by
                        suspending the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>, or otherwise, lawfully
                        detain him indefinitely on suspicion, without trial, or without any right in
                        our government to demand his release? Also, his opinion on the application
                        of the law of the 29th July, 1868, to such cases, and the President’s duty
                        under it.”</p>
                    <p>Another resolution was then reported back to the House with a recommendation
                        that it should likewise be tabled. The terms were:</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the President of the United States, if
                        not incompatible with the public service, be requested to communicate to
                        this House all correspondence with the British Government on file in the
                        State Department with reference to the case of D. H. O’Connor, a citizen of
                        the United States, now imprisoned in Ireland.”</p>
                    <p>The House, however, refused by 79 to 71 to do so, and a long discussion
                        ensued upon it. The chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs having
                        stated that he had not understood that this resolution had been considered
                        by the committee, a point of order was raised on the ground that the
                        resolution was not a report of the committee, and Mr. Cox, of New York, then
                        moved to recommit it, and to insert therein the names of Michael Hart, H.
                        O’Mahoney, and John McEnery, and to add a clause requesting the President to
                        demand of the British Government the prompt trial of those citizens or their
                        prompt release, whereupon Mr. Orth, of Indiana, the reporter of the
                        Committee on Foreign Affairs, stated that he had no objection to such action
                        being taken, and the resolution was accordingly recommitted with
                        instructions as above stated.</p>
                    <p>The only real point of interest in the discussion was the production of a
                        letter from ex-Secretary Blaine to the brother of Denis O’Connor, in which,
                        in speaking of the action of the British Government, he “reminds him that
                        the act of Parliament under which O’Conner is held is a law of Great
                        Britain, and it is an elementary principle of public law that in such case
                        the government of that country, in the exercise of its varied functions,
                        judicial and executive, administers and interprets the law in question. The
                        right of every government in this respect is absolute and sovereign, and
                        every person who voluntarily brings himself within the jurisdiction of the
                        country, whether permanently or temporarily, is subject to the operation of
                        its laws, whether he be a citizen or mere resident. In stating this familiar
                        principle, no more is conceded to Great Britain than every country may of
                        right demand, and it is one of the sovereign rights which the Government of
                        the United States has always insisted upon and maintained for itself.”</p>
                    <p>A letter from the United States minister in London to the United States
                        consul at Cork was also quoted, in which that minister says:</p>
                    <p>“The coercion act, so called, is an exceptional and arbitrary measure. * * *
                        Its very substance and main purpose are to deprive suspected persons of the
                        speedy trial they desire. This law is of course contrary to the spirit and
                        foundation principles of both English and American jurisprudence. But it is
                        the law of the land, and it controls all persons domiciled in the proclaimed
                        districts of Ireland, whether they are <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252"
                            facs="0324"/>British subjects or not, and it is manifestly entirely
                        futile to claim that naturalized citizens of the United States should be
                        exempted from its operation.</p>
                    <p>“Unless I am instructed to the contrary by the Department of State, I must
                        take this view of my duties.”</p>

                                Citizenship.</hi>—Mr. Denis H. O’Connor, who is now confined in
                            prison in Ireland as a “suspect,” and over whose case quite a discussion
                            occurred in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, was formerly a
                            resident of Baltimore. He is a brother of Mr. P. C. O’Connor, who keeps
                            a grocery store at the corner of Chase and Chapel streets, and is a
                            fully naturalized citizen of the United States. Mr. P. C. O’Connor was
                            called upon yesterday by an American reporter, and in response to
                            inquiries, stated that his brother, Denis H. O’Connor, the prisoner
                            alluded to, had resided in Baltimore for ten years previous to 1878, in
                            which year, being broken down in health, he had taken a trip to Ireland,
                            and had since made it his home. He had while in this city been an active
                            and energetic business man, and among other houses with which he was
                            associated were mentioned Hinkelman, Jackson, and Phelps, of Baltimore;
                            John B. Ellison &amp;, Son, of Philadelphia; and Dahlnen, Forbes &amp;
                            Co., of New York. His health-being partially restored shortly after
                            landing in Ireland, Mr. O’Connor opened an extensive dry-goods
                            establishment in Charleville, county Cork, and another in Kilmallock,
                            county Limerick. His brother says that Denis was a general favorite on
                            account of his genial disposition, but more, perhaps, on account of his
                            outspoken love for republican institutions. When the Land League
                            agitation commenced, O’Connor was chosen as treasurer of the Charville
                            Branch, and so remained until arrested on the 22d October, 1881. Mr. P.
                            C. O’Connor, on learning of the arrest of his brother, took steps to
                            obtain his release on the ground of American citizenship. He procured a
                            letter of introduction from Mayor Whyte to the then Secretary of State,
                            Mr. Blaine, and proceeding to Washington, laid the whole case before Mr.
                            Blaine. On the 25th November, 1881, Mr. P. C. O’Connor received a letter
                            from Mr. Blaine, in which it was stated that the case was one of a class
                            receiving the attention of the government, and would take the same
                            course as others preceding it. Mr. Blaine also reminded Mr. O’Connor
                            that the act of Parliament under which his brother <pb n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253" facs="0325"/>is held is a law of Great Britain, and
                            that it is an elementary principle of public law that in such cases the
                            government of that country, in the exercise of its varied functions,
                            judicial and executive, administers and interprets the law. The right of
                            every government in this respect, says Mr. Blaine, is absolute and
                            sovereign, and every person who voluntarily brings himself within the
                            jurisdiction of the country, whether temporarily or permanently, whether
                            he be a citizen or a mere resident, is subject to the operation of those
                            laws so long as, in the case of the alien resident, no treaty
                            stipulation or principle of international law is contravened by the
                            proceedings taken against him. Mr. P. C. O’Connor has also, since the
                            change made in the cabinet, addressed quite a long communication to Mr.
                            Frelinghuysen on the same subject, calling his attention to cases of a
                            similar character in years gone by, with the action of various
                            Secretaries of State in each case. To this letter no reply has as yet
                            been received.</p>

                        received yesterday from Mr. Frelinghuysen a cable dispatch in cipher, of

                    <p>“Referring to the cases of O’Connor, Hart, McSweeney, Walsh, McEnery, and
                        Dal-tol, American citizens imprisoned in Ireland, say to Lord Granville
                        that, without discussing whether the provisions of the force act can be
                        applied to American citizens, the President hopes that the lord lieutenant
                        of Ireland will be instructed to exercise the powers intrusted to him by the
                        first section to order early trials in their (and all other) cases in which
                        Americans may be arrested.”</p>

                        have to-day received a dispatch from Mr. Frelinghuysen, instructing me to
                        inquire into the circumstances attending the arrest of Mr. James L. White, a
                        naturalized American citizen, who has been for some months imprisoned in
                        Naas jail, in Ireland, under the so-called “coercion act,” on a charge of
                        being “reasonably suspected” of offenses against this act.</p>
                    <p>Mr. N. P. Hill, a Senator of the United States from the State of Colorado,
                        has represented to the Secretary that Mr. White was for two years a member
                        of the city council of Denver, in that State, and is said to be a peaceable,
                        quiet man, well-disposed toward <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0327"
                        />good government. He left Denver about the 22d day July, 1878, and returned
                        to Ireland for the purpose of visiting his aged father, and staying with him
                        the remainder of his life. Very respectable persons in Denver offer to vouch
                        for the intelligence, sobriety, and integrity of Mr. White.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to ask your lordship that inquiries may be made into the
                        circumstances attending the arrest of Mr. White, and if it shall appear that
                        there has been any mistake or undue severity in his case, that he may be
                        released or granted a speedy trial.</p>

                        been given both by the President of the United States and by the Secretary
                        of State, upon the application that has been made by Her Majesty’s minister
                        at Washington in order to obtain for William Lane, a British subject, who is
                        detained in prison at Detroit, a judicial hearing of his case, which the
                        accused asserts he is unable to obtain.</p>
                    <p>In reply, I beg leave to express to you my thanks for the information you
                        have conveyed to me respecting William Lane, the particulars of whose ease
                        have not yet reached this department, and to assure you that the action of
                        the President and of Mr. Frelinghuysen with regard to the representations
                        made by Mr. West are cordially recognized by Her Majesty’s Government.</p>

                        prison in Ireland under the protection of person and property (Ireland) act,
                        I greatly regret the delay which has arisen in replying to the
                        representations you have already addressed to me on their behalf. This delay
                        has unfortunately been unavoidable, and has only occurred from the necessity
                        of communicating upon the subject with the responsible advisers of Her
                        Majesty in Ireland. I trust, however, that I may very shortly be in a
                        position to communicate to you the views of Her Majesty’s Government in this
                        matter.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I told Mr. Lowell in conversation to-day that
                        the communications which he had addressed to me, and of which copies were
                        forwarded to you with my dispatch of the 29th instant, with regard to the
                        suspects imprisoned in Ireland, who are alleged to be citizens of the United
                        States, involve principles of such importance that Her Majesty’s Government
                        would prefer to convey their views on the subject to the Government of the
                        United States through Her Majesty’s minister at Washington. I hope to be
                        able to send you the necessary instructions for this purpose in the course
                        of a few days.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile, I stated to Mr. Lowell, as you will have learned from my
                        telegram of this day, that the imprisonment of suspects under the protection
                        of person and property (Ireland) act, 1881, is not a measure for the
                        punishment of crime but for its prevention. In many instances prisoners have
                        been released by the Irish Government upon reasonable belief that this could
                        be done without risk to the public safety. Her Majesty’s Government, I
                        added, are not desirous of unnecessarily detaining in prison any person from
                        whom no danger to the public peace need be apprehended, and they will be
                        prepared, therefore, to take into consideration the circumstances of any
                        citizens of the United States now so detained who may be willing to engage
                        forthwith to leave the United Kingdom.</p>

                        who is confined in Limerick County jail, under the protection of person and
                        property act (Ireland), and who incloses a certificate of his naturalization
                        as a citizen of the United States on the 17th December, 1872, which seems to
                        be in proper form.</p>
                    <p>I have already communicated to your lordship a telegram which I received on
                        the 4th March last, in which I was directed to say that the President hoped
                        the lord-lieutenant of Ireland would be instructed to exercise the powers
                        intrusted to him by the first section of the act in question, to order early
                        trials in the cases of the suspects mentioned in that telegram, and in all
                        other cases in which Americans might be arrested. I beg, therefore, that the
                        President’s request may be granted in the case of Mr. Slattery, who states
                        that he has been imprisoned since the 25th July last.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am an Englishman, a native of Bristol,
                            Gloucestershire, and claim your assistance under the following
                            circumstances:</p>
                        <p>On the 18th June last I was arrested on a charge of attempted murder, and
                            have since then been held in jail awaiting trial, which I am utterly
                            unable to obtain. I have been taken into court eight or nine times, and
                            always remanded on some pretext or other. I can easily prove my
                            innocence if I have half a chance, but as I have no relations and no
                            money I cannot get it. I have written to judge, prosecuting attorney,
                            and the papers to demand the trial that I think I am entitled to, but
                            this is such a free country that they do as they like, and do not like
                            to give me one. A week ago I was in court and the judge promised to
                            discharge me to-day if the prosecution would not go on with the case,
                            but to-day 1 went down and was again remanded.</p>
                        <p>I am 20 years of age, a printer by trade, and have been four years in
                            this country, coming to New York in January, 1878. I have never even
                            been arrested before, and always bore a good character. The holding of
                            me so is contrary to the laws of Michigan, and grossly unjust anyway.
                            Will you please put a stop to this sort of thing as quickly as possible.
                            If you write a line to the judge I think he will discharge me directly,
                            and I would sooner it was done quietly, but anyway get me out of this.
                            The judge’s name is Chambers, Wayne circuit court, Detroit, Mich.</p>
                        <p>Hoping to have an answer by return, I remain, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to receive on the 25th
                            instant your note of the 24th, in relation to the imprisonment at
                            Detroit, Mich., of a British subject, named William Lane, who, it is
                            stated, has been hitherto unable to obtain trial on the charge under
                            which he has been held since the 18th June last. I immediately addressed
                            a telegram to the attorney-general of the State of Michigan, acquainting
                            him with the purport of your note, and expressing the desire of the
                            President to learn the facts of the case, and to have the best exertions
                            of the State authorities used to secure to Mr. Lane the early trial
                            which he asserted he was unable to obtain.</p>
                        <p>I am now in receipt of a telegram of yesterday’s date from Mr. J. J. Van
                            Riper, the attorney-general of Michigan, who, it seems, at once went
                            from the capital of the State to Detroit, to investigate the case in
                            person. The facts, as very fully reported by Mr. Van Riper, are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>William Lane, the accused, had formed an attachment for the wife of one
                            George W. Allen, also a British subject. On the 16th June, 1881, Lane
                            and Allen were out together in a boat. Lane prepared in a cup a drink
                            which he represented to be lemon juice, but which contained a large
                            quantity of morphine, and gave it to Allen, who swallowed the liquid.
                            Violent vomiting ensued, which saved Allen’s life, although his recovery
                            was long despaired of, and he has not yet recovered from the effects of
                            the poison.</p>
                        <p>Lane was arrested on the following day, 17th June, 1881. He made a
                            written confession that he had poisoned Allen, adding that his intention
                            was, when Allen should have become unconscious, to tip him out of the
                            boat. He subsequently withdrew his confession, saying that he did not
                            know what he said or wrote. Mr. Van Riper has seen this written
                            confession.</p>
                        <p>Lane was arraigned for trial on the 29th September, 1881. Since that time
                            repeated continuances have been had, but in every instance at the
                            request of Lane’s attorneys, and never on the application of the
                            prosecution. The case is, however, now on trial; it was begun on Friday
                            last, the 24th instant; was continued on Saturday, and was on trial
                            yesterday. The State’s attorney-general finds no blame attaching to the
                            authorities for the delay in bringing Lane to trial. The low state of
                            Allen, who was suffering from the poison, prevented the case from being
                            set down for trial earlier than the 29th September, 1881, in the absence
                            of the principal witness, while since that date the dilatory motions, as
                            before said, have come wholly from the side of the defense.</p>
                        <p>I have acquainted Mr. Lowell by telegraph of the investigation ordered on
                            receipt of your note and of its result, in order that Her Majesty’s
                            Government may see the jealous watchfulness which this government is
                            disposed to exercise when the inherent right of any accused person, and
                            especially a subject of a friendly state, to a speedy trial on the
                            charges preferred, is in question.</p>

                        have received this morning two applications for my intervention from
                        citizens of the United States who have been arrested under the protection of
                        person and property act (Ireland) 1881. One of them is William Brophy, who
                        sends his certificate of naturalization, and states that he was arrested on
                        the 4th March last, and is confined in Naas jail. The other is John Leonard
                        Gannon, who asserts that he was born at Hampton Hill, in the State of
                        Connecticut, on the 13th December, 1852, and imprisoned in the jail at
                        Galway on the 7th May, 1881, on suspicion of being one of an unlawful
                        assembly. He says also that he knows nothing further of the charge against
                        him or of his accuser.</p>
                    <p>I have no information of the causes why Brophy was arrested, but I shall
                        write to our consul at Dublin to ascertain what is stated in the warrant on
                        this subject, and I may have occasion to address your lordship again in
                        relation to it.</p>
                    <p>In respect to the case of Mr. Gannon, his imprisonment has now continued for
                        so long a period that I am sure your lordship will understand why I ask your
                        attention to it with unusual earnestness.</p>
                    <p>It is so contrary to the spirit of English as well as of American law to keep
                        a man in <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0333"/>prison for many months
                        without any opportunity of confronting his accusers or of disproving the
                        charges against him, that your lordship cannot be surprised at the great
                        excitement which such cases as this of Mr. Gannon have occasioned in the
                        United States, or at the instructions I have received from my government to
                        ask respectfully that the accused parties may either be released or brought
                        to trial.</p>
                    <p>I beg leave to repeat this request in the cases of Mr. Brophy and Mr. Gannon,
                        as well as of other American citizens who have been imprisoned in Ireland,
                        some of them for long periods of time.</p>

                        lordship that a bill has been introduced into the Senate by Senator Morgan,
                        of Alabama, to define the rights of American citizens in and when residing
                        in foreign countries. It sets forth that the rights of American citizenship
                        in foreign countries, which are required to be protected in the manner and
                        by the means provided in section 2001 of the Revised Statutes, extend to and
                        include the right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects
                        against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to be exempt from
                        domiciliary visits without legal warrant, according to the forms of law of
                        the country in which they are dwelling; and the right on demand of
                        themselves or counsel to be informed of the nature and cause of any
                        accusation against them, when they are under arrest or are imprisoned upon a
                        suspicion, or accusation, or charged of being guilty of any crime or offense
                        against the laws of such foreign country; and the right of trial in such
                        cases within a reasonable time to be confronted with witness against them,
                        to have compulsory process for obtaining witness in their favor, and to have
                        counsel for their defense. This bill was read and referred to the Committee
                        on Foreign Relations.</p>

                            may be said as to the justice or injustice of the charges. They have
                            been imprisoned under the coercion acts, which are now the public law of
                            Ireland. Legally arrested, they have not been tried; and accordingly
                            there has been no judical investigation which would enable the President
                            to determine whether they have been justly or unjustly deprived of their
                            liberty. It is utterly impossible for the President to decide whether
                            the arrest of these suspects has been “wrongful” and in “violation of
                            the rights of American citizenship,” and consequently he cannot demand
                            their release. Congress never has given and never can give the Executive
                            the right to demand the unconditional release of an American citizen,
                            naturalized or native-born, who has been legally arrested in another
                            civilized state. If he has been illegally arrested, or if his innocence
                            has been established after a judicial investigation, his release may be
                            demanded, but not otherwise.</p>
                        <p>What, then, is it in the province of the Executive to demand in the case
                            of the Irish-American suspects? Let their naturalization be assumed, and
                            they must be held by Great Britain to be entitled to all the rights
                            which have been guaranteed to citizens of the United States under the
                            naturalization treaty. A fair and impartial trial in accordance with the
                            local law that has been violated is one of those rights, and the
                            Executive is justified in demanding it, for the suspects have been in
                            prison many months. But in the proclaimed districts of Ireland the local
                            law has been suspended. The government does not grant to its own
                            subjects the privilege of a jury trial in those districts; and, indeed,
                            a jury trial would not be a judicial process under the circumstances,
                            for each and every suspect would be acquitted without regard to the
                            facts of the case. A fair and impartial trial, by which the innocence or
                            guilt of the accused can be ascertained, is simply out of the question.
                            That is the one demand which our government is competent to make and it
                            is one with which the British Government think it impossible to comply.
                            They might as well discharge the American suspects outright.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lowell, who has been denounced by Mr. Randall for his “sickening
                            sycophancy to English influence,” has treated this matter not as an
                            English, Irish, or American question, but purely as a point of
                            international law. He has had no sympathy with the coercion legislation,
                            and has even taken pains to characterize it as exceptional and
                            arbitrary. In his letter to the suspects who applied for his
                            intervention, he says: “The chief object of these measures is to enable
                            the authorities to arrest persons whom they suspect of illegal conduct,
                            without being obliged to produce any proof of their guilt. Its very
                            substance and main purpose are to deprive suspected persons of the
                            speedy trial they desire. This law is, of course, contrary to the spirit
                            and foundation principles of both English and American jurisprudence.
                            But it is the law of the land, and it controls all persons domiciled in
                            the proclaimed districts of Ireland, whether they are British subjects
                            or not; and it is manifestly futile to claim that naturalized citizens
                            of the United States should be exempted from its operation.”</p>
                        <p>That law legalized the arrest of the suspects in districts where the writ
                            of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> had been suspended, and where
                            the natives were not allowed the privilege of a jury trial. To have
                            demanded their unconditional release, when no discrimination had been
                            made between them and the natives, would have been an open affront to a
                            friendly power. What Mr. Lowell did was to follow the best precedents of
                            criminal jurisdiction in international cases, several of which had been
                            established during the American civil war, when British subjects were
                            arbitrarily arrested and denied the privilege of trial. At the same
                            time, he has conducted the negotiations with the foreign office with so
                            much tact and decision that we are inclined to expect a speedy clearance
                            of the Irish jails from suspects whose citizenship in the United States
                            is authenticated. Whatever may be the privileges of the natives, the
                            British Government are not likely to incur the odium of imprisoning
                            foreigners for indefinite terms without trial. They will be glad to
                            release them, if they can be assured that their naturalization papers
                            shall not be used as a safe-conduct for conspiracy in the proclaimed
                            districts of Ireland.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lowell’s Success</hi>.—Mr. Lowell’s negotiations
                            for the release of the Irish-American suspects have been crowned with
                            partial success. Before the mass meeting at Cooper Institute disgraced
                            itself by heaping reproaches upon him, the Department <pb n="264"
                                xml:id="pg_264" facs="0336"/>of State had received official
                            information that all but three of these prisoners had been set at
                            liberty in response to the request of the United States minister. The
                            three suspects who have not been released are McSweeny, McEnery, and
                            O’Mahoney. Two of these are undoubtedly naturalized citizens, and as
                            such are entitled to a fair and impartial trial. The British Government
                            is either unable or unwilling to order a judicial investigation, but it
                            will not incur the odium of imprisoning the citizens of another state
                            for an indefinite period. The leading English journals concede that any
                            suspect whose naturalization in the United States can be established
                            will be released if he agrees to leave the country; and the State
                            Department has every reason to expect that this action will be speedily
                            taken in these two cases. There is some doubt as to the validity of
                            O’Mahoney’s naturalization, but the chances are in favor of his release,
                            as the British foreign office does not seem to be disposed to make an
                            exception in his case on technical grounds if he will promise to leave
                            Ireland as soon as he is released.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen reports that the negotiations have been carried on
                            between the two governments for sometime “in a spirit of entire
                            friendship.” This result has been promoted by the cordial relations
                            existing between Lord Granville and Mr. Lowell. The fact that our
                            government has been represented in these negotiations by one of our
                            foremost men of letters has been a most fortunate circumstance. Mr.
                            Lowell had won the respect and admiration of the best men in English
                            public life, and when he came to plead for these suspects his personal
                            character and popularity were of direct service to them. Bluster and bad
                            manners would have prolonged their imprisonment and disturbed the
                            relations of the two countries. Mr. Lowell made, as our special cable
                            dispatches have stated, every effort consistent with diplomatic usage,
                            and at the same time performed a most delicate duty with such consummate
                            tact as to remove all sources of irritation. The result has been that as
                            soon as the formalities of proving the naturalization of the suspects
                            have been complied with, all but three of them have been released, and
                            the liberation of the remaining prisoners is confidently expected by the
                            State Department.</p>
                        <p>The delicacy of Mr. Lowell’s task will be better appreciated if the fact
                            be borne in mind that the British Government is struggling hand over
                            hand with a formidable conspiracy which has been directly promoted by
                            the Irish citizens of the United States. The passage of the land act
                            would have paralyzed the League if the Parnellites had not been forced
                            by pressure from this side of the ocean to denounce it and to proclaim
                            the repudiation of rent-paying. It has been moral and pecuniary support
                            from the American base of supplies which has enabled the agitators to
                            defy the Liberal Government and to prolong indefinitely a blustering
                            period of lawlessness and anarchy in Ireland. Not a week passes but
                            there are cowardly assassinations and revolting crimes committed in
                            every quarter of the island. Tenants whose sole offense is a disposition
                            to pay their debts and to live in peace with their landlords are
                            murdered in cold blood. Land agents are fired at from hedges, and
                            innocent women are butchered in the high roads. We do not say that the
                            Land League organization and its American contributors are responsible
                            for the shocking crimes; but it cannot be denied that they have delayed
                            the pacification of the island which might have been effected under the
                            beneficent clauses of the land act, and by prolonging the agitation have
                            multiplied opportunities for agrarian horrors.</p>
                        <p>Is it to be wondered at that the British Government should have hesitated
                            before releasing suspects whose only claim for consideration was a
                            questionable citizenship in the United States? The money contributed for
                            the cause could not be intercepted; if the patriotic sympathy and moral
                            support could not be counteracted; but those who came from America to
                            instigate revolution and crime must share the risks with native
                            conspirators. This being the English view of the case, diplomatic
                            intervention in behalf of the suspects was extremely likely to excite
                            intense irritation. If, therefore, Mr. Lowell has dispatched the
                            business, rescued the prisoners, and asserted the rights of American
                            citizenship, without causing bitterness or estrangement between the two
                            governments, he is entitled to the gratitude of Americans and Englishmen
                            alike. If his intellectual attainments, his graces of manner, and his
                            personal friendships in English society have contributed to that end, it
                            was not a mistake to send to the court of St. James an American
                            gentleman.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Adams called upon me three days ago
                            and read to me a confidential dispatch from Mr. Seward respecting the
                            Fenian agitation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seward said that he did not think that either time or occasion had
                            arrived for making any communication on the subject to Her Majesty’s
                            Government, but in view of the news which had arrived of the suspension
                            of the act of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> in Ireland, Mr.
                            Seward thought Mr. Adams ought to be informed of the sentiments of the
                            President in regard to Fenianism.</p>
                        <p>The Fenian excitement in the United States was, Mr. Seward said, a
                            political question, exclusively affecting Ireland as one of the United
                            Kingdoms. Those engaged in the agitation were, as a general rule, native
                            Irishmen, of whom some had, while others had not, become naturalized in
                            the United States. In moving, controlling, and directing the Fenian
                            agitation these persons were influenced by feeling, sentiments, and
                            views which they cherish as Irishmen, notwithstanding their change of
                            domicile or place of residence or citizenship. In a word, the Fenian was
                            a British, and not an American movement.</p>
                        <p>The only question for the United States Government, Mr. Seward said, was
                            not whether the motives or designs of these agitations in regard to
                            Ireland were just, wise beneficent, and humane, or the reverse, but
                            whether, in seeking to promote their designs, they commit any violation
                            of the laws of the United States which have been adopted to prevent
                            military or naval aggression against nations with whom the United States
                            are at peace.</p>
                        <p>Thus far, Mr. Seward said, no such violation of the law had been brought
                            to the knowledge of the United States Government, either by its own
                            agents or by the British Legation, and it did not appear to the United
                            States Government to be wise to denounce the proceedings of the
                            agitators so long as they were confined within those limits of moral
                            agitation recognized equally by the United States and Great Britain as
                            legitimate.</p>
                        <p>It was not unreasonable to suppose that any unlawful enterprises against
                            Ireland and the Colonies contrived in the United States would prove
                            abortive and even absurd unless the movement had some connection with an
                            uprising in the country to be invaded. It was not for the United States
                            Government to pronounce upon the improbability or otherwise of such an
                            uprising in Ireland. It was, however, reasonable to suppose that if
                            anything of the sort was contemplated, the suspension of the act of <hi
                                rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> would bring matters to a crisis,
                            and if no uprising had taken place, it might be supposed either that
                            such a movement had not been meditated, or that it had been averted. In
                            either case it was not to be apprehended that a violation of United
                            States neutrality would now be committed. On the other hand, if any
                            insurrection should have already broken out in Ireland, it would be by
                            no means the purpose or policy of the United <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
                                facs="0338"/>States to suffer their own laws to he violated, and
                            their dignity and honor to be compromised.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seward further said that it might he expected that some Irish-born
                            hut naturalized American citizens who might be now sojourning or
                            traveling in Ireland would be arrested upon complaints of complicity in
                            seditious proceedings. Of these, some would probably be innocent, and
                            others guilty. The situation would thus for a time necessarily become
                            inconvenient and embarrassing; but Mr. Seward frankly admitted that
                            Americans, whether native born or naturalized, owe submission to the
                            same laws in Great Britain as British subjects while residing there and
                            enjoying the protection of the British Government, and Mr. Seward added
                            that the United States Government has applied the converse of that
                            principle to British subjects who were sojourning or traveling in the
                            United States during the late rebellion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Adams was, therefore, to give a careful examination to each
                            complaint, dealing at all times frankly with the British Government, and
                            asking on their part strict justice where American citizens were
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Adams that I had listened with much satisfaction to the views
                            and opinions of Mr. Seward, as stated in the dispatch which he had just
                            read to me, and that I trusted that both the state of Ireland and the
                            prudence of the lord lieutenant would prevent any difference between Her
                            Majesty’s Government and that of the United States upon a question
                            involving a principle, the discussion of which, in connection with
                            Fenianism, it would be desirable not to enter upon.</p>

                                may have attention drawn to it through Mr. Lowell, the American
                                minister. I am imprisoned in this jail, under the “coercion act,”
                                since May 7, 1881, on suspicion of being one of an unlawful
                                assembly. I have never been brought to trial, nor do I know anything

                                recorded by Dr. Dyer Hughes. The governor of the State at the time
                                was, I think, Governor Cleveland. Will you kindly forward these
                                facts at once to the proper quarter, and have attention drawn to my
                                case, as I am now eleven months imprisoned here without trial.</p>

                                at Fort (illegible) August 5, 1870. I served in Capt. Charles A.

                                release. It is disgraceful the way Americans are treated. I am a

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I see by the Freeman Journal of
                                the 27th of April, where Mr. Orth stated, during the debate on
                                American citizens confined in British prisons, that. I held an
                                office in Great Britain when arrested.</p>
                            <p>Now, sir, I claim that whatever source Mr. Orth received such
                                information from misinformed him; and in justice to me I must
                                respectfully ask you to contradict it.</p>
                            <p>When Colonel Brooks (United States consulate at Queenstown) called on
                                me last June at Limerick prison, Mr. Eagan (who is governor of that
                                prison) tried to prejudice my case by saying that I held an office
                                in this country, and evidently whoever furnished Mr. Orth or the
                                Department of State at Washington with such information, was
                                prompted by the same motives.</p>
                            <p>The position I held then and <hi rend="italic">does</hi> hold now
                                (and which I explained to Colonel Brooks) is that of a poor-law
                                guardian; it is a position that an American, German, Russian, or any
                                other man may hold, provided he resides in the township, occupies
                                premises rated to a certain amount, and elected by the people. His
                                duty is to administer to the wants of the poor for a period of not
                                over one year, except <hi rend="italic">rellected</hi>: he receives
                                no remuneration for his services, and no oaths of office required;
                                therefore I cannot see how it could prejudice my <hi rend="italic"
                                    >cas</hi> as far as claiming protection as an American citizen;
                                on the contrary, it clearly proves that I don’t belong to the class
                                which coercion was intended, viz, village tyrants and dissolute
                                ruffians, as no man is elected to that position except a respectable
                                man and a man who possesses the confidence of the people.</p>
                            <p>And it seems that all the information that could possibly be
                                furnished from this side of the Atlantic to the Department of State
                                at Washington to prejudice the cases of American citizens confined
                                in British prisons has been furnished, and hence our long
                                confinement without trial.</p>
                            <p>I would respectfully draw your attention to a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >cumunication</hi> of mine last July, requesting you to grant me
                                a trial, which I believed then and now I ought to be entitled to.
                                Your reply was that I should show there was some exceptional
                                injustice done me before calling on you to intervene, and also that,
                                in your opinion, when a man violates the law of the country he
                                should be held amenable to the law he violated. In reply to the
                                first part of your letter, it was impossible for me to show the
                                injustice done me while I was locked in a convict’s cell, deprived
                                of all communication with the outer world, even to a member of the
                                United States House of Representatives or the British House of

                                guilty of violating the law, why not grant me a trial, convict, and
                                punish me. It is true I have been punished severely, but without
                                crime, trial, or conviction, and I challenge the British Government
                                to-day to grant me an impartial trial and prove that I have violated
                                the laws of any civilized country.</p>
                            <p>In your letter of the 25th instant you stated that my case was under
                                consideration at the Department of State at Washington. I claim,
                                sir, that it is impossible for my case to be favorably considered
                                while representations are made to them that I hold an office in
                                Great Britain, and consequently I am not entitled to the protection
                                of an American citizen, and probably they (the Department of State)
                                considers the source from which they receive their information from
                                reliable. Therefore, I must again ask you, in justice to me, and I
                                hope in the discharge of your own duty, immediately contradict such
                                misrepresentation.</p>
                            <p>I am, sir, yours, respectfully,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Sackville West has handed me copies of
                            two dispatches from Lord Granville to him respecting the Clayton-Bulwer
                            treaty; the first, dated 7th January last, comments upon Mr. Blaine’s
                            270 of the <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0344"/>19th of November;
                            the second, of the 14th January, comments upon Mr. Blaine’s 281 of the
                            29th November.</p>
                        <p>They have been read with interest and with attention. After careful
                            consideration, the President is not without hope that the views of the
                            two governments may be harmonized in this matter. He therefore directs
                            me to communicate to you, somewhat at length, the opinions entertained
                            here respecting the traditional continental policy of the United States
                            and the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.</p>
                        <p>A canal across the isthmus for vessels of all dimensions and every
                            character, under possible conditions hereinafter referred to, would
                            affect this republic in its trade and commerce; would expose our Western
                            coast to attack; destroy our isolation; oblige us to improve our
                            defenses and to increase our Navy, and possibly compel us, contrary to
                            our traditions, to take an active interest in the affairs of European
                            nations. The United States, with their large and increasing population
                            and wealth, cannot be uninterested in a change in the physical
                            conformation of this hemisphere which may injuriously affect either the
                            material or political interests of the republic, and naturally seek that
                            the severance of the isthmus connecting the continents shall be effected
                            in harmony with those interests. This government, while believing that
                            the isthmus should not be severed so as to do unnecessary injury to the
                            United States, at the same time appreciates the desire of Great Britain
                            that she should be able by a short and easy passage from ocean to ocean
                            to reach her eastern and American possessions on the Pacific, and that
                            other nations of the world have a similar interest in such a passage.
                            There is, however, no necessary conflict between the political claims of
                            the United States in this matter and the material inte rests of other
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>A canal across the isthmus can be created, and, under the protectorate of
                            the United States and the republic whose territory it may cross, can be
                            freely used by all nations; thus in some degree would be continued to
                            the United States the benefit of that conformation of the earth which is
                            now an element of security and defense.</p>
                        <p>For thirty years the Panama Railroad has been maintained without other
                            protection than that of the United States and the local sovereign, in
                            accordance with the treaty of 1846 with New Granada.</p>
                        <p>During that period Great Britain has carried to a successful result the
                            wars of the Crimea and the Indian mutiny; France has three times
                            convulsed Europe with strife; a conflict between Russia and Turkey has
                            changed the face of the Ottoman Empire; thrones have crumbled; empires
                            have been constructed; republics have arisen, while on this continent
                            the most remarkable civil war in history has occurred, and at the same
                            time the Emperor of the French was lending his active support to an
                            aspirant for imperial honors in the neighboring republic of Mexico.
                            Within that period almost every form of war and strife has taken place
                            that would seem to make especially necessary the neutralization of the
                            isthmus, and yet the trains of the Panama Railroad have run from ocean
                            to ocean peacefully and with no other interruption than what has come
                            from the rare turbulence of the local population.</p>
                        <p>During the same time another isthmus has been pierced, and while wars
                            have raged within sight of the Mediterranean port the peaceful commerce
                            of the world has moved through the Suez Canal quietly and safely under
                            no international protectorate.</p>
                        <p>If no guarantee or protectorate has been found necessary during such
                            troubled times, it can scarcely be required in the more peaceful period
                            which both the Government of the United States and that of Great Britain
                            hope and strive for.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0345"/>
                        <p>The President, therefore, considers it unnecessary and unwise, through an
                            invitation to the nations of the earth, to guarantee the neutrality of
                            the transit of the isthmus, to give their natives a pretext for
                            assembling in waters contiguous to our shores, and to possibly involve
                            this republic in conflicts from which its natural position entitles it
                            to be relieved.</p>
                        <p>It will doubtless occur to Lord Granville, as it does to us, that
                            international agreements of this kind, calling for interference by
                            force, and conferring joint rights upon several independent powers, are
                            calculated to breed dissension and trouble. In times of peace, when
                            there is no call for their exercise, they are harmless though useless.
                            But when wars and trouble come, it too frequently happens that
                            differences arise, and so at the very moment when the agreement should
                            be enforced it is impossible to enforce it; and such agreements would
                            lead to that political intervention in American affairs which the
                            traditional policy of the United States make it impossible that the
                            President should either consent to or look upon with indifference.</p>
                        <p>The President believes that the formation of a protectorate by European
                            nations over the isthmus transit would be in conflict with a doctrine
                            which has been for many years asserted by the United States. This
                            sentiment is properly termed a doctrine, as it has no prescribed
                            sanction and its assertion is left to the exigency which may invoke it.
                            It has been repeatedly announced by the Executive Department of this
                            government and through the utterances of distinguished citizens; it is
                            cherished by the American people, and has been approved by the
                            Government of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>It is not the inhospitable principle which it is sometimes charged with
                            being, and which asserts that European nations shall not retain dominion
                            on this hemisphere, and that none but republican governments shall here
                            be tolerated; for we well know that a large part of the North American
                            continent is under the dominion of Her Majesty’s Government, and that
                            the United States were in the past the first to recognize the imperial
                            authority of Dom Pedro in Brazil and of Iturbide in Mexico. It is not
                            necessary now to define that doctrine, but its history clearly shows
                            that it at least opposes any intervention by European nations in the
                            political affairs of American republics.</p>
                        <p>In 1823, Mr. Canning, with the concurrence of the cabinet of London,
                            informed Mr. Rush that Great Britain could not see with indifference the
                            intervention of foreign powers in Spanish America, or the transfer to
                            those powers of any of the colonies, and suggested a joint declaration
                            to that effect by the United States and Great Britain. This suggestion
                            grew out of the relations then existing between France and Spain, their
                            attitude towards the South American republics then struggling for
                            independence, and the injuries to the colonies and commerce of Great
                            Britain which would result from a successful prosecution of the policy
                            of those two governments. President Monroe did not adopt the proposal
                            for a joint declaration, but in his message of December 2, 1823, after
                            stating that it was our policy not to interfere with the internal
                            concerns of European powers, speaking of the war which the revolted
                            colonies were carrying on against Spain, and of contemplated
                            interference by the “Holy Alliance” in behalf of the latter, said, in
                            language which has gone into history under his name, thus: <quote

                                    conspicuously different. It is impossible that the allied powers
                                    should extend their political system to any portion of either
                                    continent without endangering our peace and happiness, nor <pb

                                    that we should behold such interposition in any form with
                                    indifference.</p>

                        <p>This sentiment was received in England with enthusiasm. Mr. Brougham
                            said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The question in regard to Spanish America is now, I believe,
                                    disposed of, or nearly so; for an event has recently happened
                                    than which none has ever dispersed greater joy, exultation, and
                                    gratitude over all the freedmen of Europe; that event which is
                                    decisive on the subject is the language held with respect to

                            Mr. Monroe, explained in a message to the House of Representatives on

                            with the existing European colonies in America; that the language was
                            only a frank declaration that the United States could not look with

                            affairs arose from complications in South America, and was announced by
                            Mr. Monroe on the suggestion of the official representative of Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>The doctrine so formulated by Monroe and expounded by Adams has since
                            remained a cardinal principle of our continental policy. In several
                            notable instances, especially in the case of the French attempt to set
                            up imperial authority in Mexico, it guided our political action, and it
                            is to day firmly imbedded in the American heart.</p>
                        <p>It is true that this doctrine refers to the political, and not to the
                            material interest of America; but no one can deny that to place the
                            isthmus under the protection and guarantee of the powers of Europe,
                            rather than under the protection of the leading power of this
                            hemisphere, would seriously threaten and affect the political interest
                            of that power.</p>
                        <p>It is not to be anticipated that Great Britain will controvert an
                            international doctrine which she suggested to the United States when
                            looking to her own interest, and which, when adopted by this republic,
                            she highly approved; and it is but frank to say that the people of this
                            country would be as unwilling that the pathway of commerce between the
                            Pacific coast and our eastern market should be under the dominion of the
                            allied European powers as would be the people of Great Britain that the
                            transit from one to another part of her possessions should be under such
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the war of the Revolution, Great Britain had acquired strong
                            positions from Halifax to Antigua, dominating the coast of the United
                            States. She retained these positions after the peace of 1783, and
                            continues to use them for offensive and defensive purposes. She has
                            strengthened old strongholds and made new ones, while the United States
                            has ever refused to avail itself of proffered commanding external
                            military stations.</p>
                        <p>No well-informed statesman doubts the ability of this nation to raise <pb
                                n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0347"/>a powerful navy. To raise such
                            a navy might bring commercial advantages to the United States, but it is
                            doubtful whether it would promote the peace of the world; and the United
                            States desire that their citizens may, without any armed assertion of
                            right, be conveyed by water transit from their western to their eastern
                            snores without passing under the guns of European powers.</p>
                        <p>These are our own views, and it is but frank to state them, while Her
                            Majesty’s Government is not called upon either to admit or deny
                            them.</p>
                        <p>To considerations such as these Lord Granville, in his dispatch of
                            November 10, 1881, answers that the position of Great Britain and the
                            United States, in reference to the canal, is determined by the— <quote

                                <p rend="flushleft">engagements entered into by them respectively in
                                    the convention, which was signed at Washington on the 19th of
                                    April, 1850, commonly known as the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and
                                    that Her Majesty’s Government rely with confidence upon the
                                    observance of all the engagements of that treaty.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>We are thus fairly brought to the consideration of the Clayton Bulwer
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The treaty relates to communication between the oceans, and divides
                            itself into two parts.</p>
                        <p>First, and principally, that which the treaty terms a “particular
                            object,” to wit, a then projected interoceanic canal in Central America
                            by the Nicaragua route; and this is the only object stated in the
                            preamble of the treaty; which says that the two governments, “being
                            desirous of consolidating the relations of amity which so happily
                            subsist between them, by setting forth and fixing in a convention their
                            views and intentions with reference to any means of communication by
                            ship-canal which may be constructed between the Atlantic and Pacific
                            Oceans by the way of the river San Juan de Nicaragua and either or both
                            of the lakes of Nicaragua or Managua to any port or place on the Pacific
                            Ocean,” to that end confer full powers on Mr. Clayton and Sir Henry
                            Bulwer.</p>
                        <p>This first and principal object of the treaty is considered in the first
                            seven articles.</p>
                        <p>Second, the subordinate object of the treaty is that treated of in the
                            remaining or eighth article, which states that the two governments
                            “having not only desired, in entering into this convention, to
                            accomplish a <hi rend="italic">particular object</hi>, but also to
                            establish a general principle (and this is the principle), hereby agree
                            to extend their protection by treaty stipulation to any other practical
                            communication” across the isthmus, “and especially to the interoceanic
                            communications, should the same prove practicable, whether by canal or
                            railroad, which are now proposed to be established by the way of
                            Tehuantepec or Panama.” This “general principle” or joint protection is
                            to be effected as stated, “by treaty stipulations.”</p>
                        <p>Although this discussion relates to a canal by the Panama route outside
                            of Central America, to which the eighth article refers, yet your
                            attention is invited as well to the first and principal as to the second
                            and subordinate purpose of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>First. While the primary object of the treaty, as will be seen, was to
                            aid the immediate construction of a canal by what is known as the
                            Nicaragua route, it is equally plain that another and important object,
                            which the United States had in view, was to dispossess Great Britain of
                            settlements in Central America, whether under cover of Indian
                            sovereignty or otherwise. The United States were tenacious that Great
                            Britain should not extend further her occupation of threatening military
                                <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0348"/>or naval strategic points
                            along their maritime frontier. To assure this, the parties to the treaty
                            jointly agreed not to exercise dominion over, or fortify or colonize
                            Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast, or any part of Central
                            America. Great Britain, however, exercises dominion over Belize or
                            British Honduras, the area of which is equal to that of Massachusetts,
                            Connecticut, and Rhode Island, and the impression prevails that since
                            the conclusion of the treaty of 1850 the English inhabitants of that
                            district have spread into the territory of the neighboring republics and
                            now occupy a large area of land which, under the convention, belongs to
                            one or the other of the two republics, but over which the government of
                            Her Majesty assumes to exercise control.</p>
                        <p>Such dominion seems to be inconsistent with that provision of the treaty
                            which prohibits the exercise of dominion by Great Britain over any part
                            of Central America. This makes it proper for me to say that the English
                            privileges, at the time of the conclusion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
                            in what has been known as the Belize, were confined to a right to cut
                            wood and establish saw-mills in a territory defined by metes and bounds.
                            These privileges were conferred by treaties, in which Spanish
                            sovereignty was recognized. On the successful revolution, the rights of
                            Spain vested in the new republics, and had not been materially changed
                            when the Clayton-Bulwer treaty was concluded. That treaty was concluded
                            April 19, and its ratification advised by the Senate May 22, 1850. On
                            the exchange of the ratifications, Sir Henry Bulwer filed in this
                            Department, under date of June 29, 1850, a declaration that the exchange
                            was made with the understanding on the part of Her Majesty’s Government
                            that the treaty did not apply to Her Majesty’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >settlement</hi> at Honduras, and its dependencies. Mr. Clayton
                            answered, under date of July 4, 1850, that he so understood, but that he
                            must not be understood to either affirm or deny British title therein.
                            It is to be observed that each of these declarations was made after the
                            conclusion of the treaty by the joint action of the President and the
                            Senate, and that the declaration was not made to or accepted by them. In
                            1859 Great Britain entered into a treaty with Guatemala, in which what
                            had been called the <hi rend="italic">settlement</hi> in the declaration
                            made on the exchange of the ratification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
                            was styled “Her Britannic Majesty’s settlement and possessions.”</p>
                        <p>In the treaty with Guatemala the boundaries were defined, and it was
                            agreed that all on one side of the defined boundaries “belongs to Her
                            Britannic Majesty.” It is further understood that when the commissioners
                            met to mark the boundary in accordance with the agreement it was found
                            that the subjects of Great Britain had occupied so much more of
                            Guatemala than was supposed that the commissioner on the part of Her
                            Majesty’s Government refused to proceed, and this large area of land has
                            since remained practically in the possession of Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>The United States have never given their assent to this conversion of the
                            British “settlement” in Central America under Spanish-American
                            sovereignty into a British “possession” with British sovereignty. There
                            is a vast difference between a settlement subject to the sovereignty of
                            the Central American republic and a colony controlled by Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>Under the treaty of 1850, while it is binding, the United States have not
                            the right to exercise dominion over or to colonize one foot of territory
                            in Central America. Great Britain is under the same rigid restriction.
                            And if Great Britain has violated and continues to violate that
                            provision, the treaty is, of course, voidable at the pleasure of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>Again, it is well known that the parties to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
                            anticipated that a canal by the Nicaragua route was to be at once
                            commenced. Under the assumption of a protectorate of Mosquito, British
                            authority was at that time in actual and visible occupation of one end
                            of the Nicaragua route, whether with or without title is not now
                            material, and it was intended by this treaty to dispossess Great Britain
                            of this occupation. This object was accomplished in 1859 and 1860 by
                            treaties between Great Britain, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua,
                            referred to in Lord Granville’s dispatch of January 14, 1882. It was to
                            this adjustment, which was one of the prime objects of the treaty, and
                            not to the colonization of British Honduras, that Mr. Buchanan in his
                            message of December 3, 1860, alludes as “an amicable and honorable
                            adjustment of dangerous questions arising from the Clayton-Bulwer
                            treaty.”</p>
                        <p>When the Clayton-Bulwer treaty was concluded it was contemplated that the
                            Nicaragua Canal, to which the treaty principally had relation, would be
                            at once commenced and finished with all possible speed by American and
                            British capital under the impulse of the joint protectorate. This
                            appears not only from the context of the treaty, but also from the
                            history of the negotiations which led to the treaty and the relations
                            which then existed between this government and the Central American
                            States.</p>
                        <p>On December 12, 1846, New Grenada, by a treaty of commerce, in
                            consideration of certain guarantees, made the United States valuable
                            grants relating to the Panama route, to which your attention will be
                            directed when we consider the rights of this republic in relation to the
                            Panama route.</p>
                        <p>The discovery of gold in California soon made it important to find some
                            rapid way of reaching it. Notwithstanding the progress of the Panama
                            Railroad scheme, public feeling was running strongly in favor of a
                            ship-canal large enough to accommodate ocean steam-ships. Influenced by
                            this strong feeling the minister of the United States in Nicaragua,
                            without instrcutions, negotiated a treaty with that republic, which
                            conferred upon certain citizens of the United States the valuable right
                            to construct a ship-canal from San Juan on the Atlantic coast to the
                            Pacific. Nicaragua claimed sovereignty over the whole of the line of the
                            proposed canal, while Great Britain, as I have shown, claimed
                            sovereignty over a porition of it occupied by the Mosquito Indians.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the concession by Nicaragua it would have been impossible
                            to procure in the United States the capital necessary for the
                            construction of a ship-canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Hence it was that; when Mr. Clayton learned of the concession, he at once
                            informed Mr. Crampton, the British minister, saying that the United
                            States did not propose to avail themselves exclusively of these
                            privileges, but wished a canal constructed, and that the claim of Great
                            Britain on behalf of the Mosquito Indians, which the United States could
                            not admit, stood in the way. The Government of the United States Mr.
                            Clayton said, was persuaded that— <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    an arrangement with regard to the Mosquito Indians as would
                                    prevent its being an obstacle to the design in question.</p>

                        <p>President Taylor was present at the interview, and “cordially concurred.”
                            Mr. Crampton reported the conversation to Lord Palmerston the 1st
                            October, and on the 15th of the same month transmitted to him a copy of
                            the concession by Nicaragua to the American company. The 22d November
                            Mr. Abbott Lawrence officially informed Lord Palmerston <pb n="278"
                                xml:id="pg_278" facs="0350"/>that an American company, aided by the
                            subscription of a large amount of British capital, had begun to
                            construct the Panama Railroad, and had completed the contracts for iron
                            for it. He transmitted to Lord Palmerston a copy of the guaranty in the
                            treaty of 1846 with New Grenada, and invited Great Britain to join in
                            the guaranty. In the same note he acquainted Her Majesty’s Government
                            with the concession from Nicaragua to the American canal company, and
                            said that the conflicting claims as to Mosquito threw an obstacle in the
                            way of the work, and invited a conversation on the subject. It seems
                            that several conversations were had, since on the 14th of the following
                            December Mr. Lawrence addressed a formal note to Lord Palmerston, in
                            which, after referring to them and again setting forth the concessions
                            for the Panama Railroad and the Nicaragua Canal, and stating that the
                            United States had “disclaimed all intention to settle, annex, colonize,
                            or fortify the territory of Central America, which declaration had been
                            met by a similar disclaimer on the part of Great Britain,” and also that
                            Her Majesty’s Government “had intimated their willingness to join with
                            the United States in their guaranty of neutrality,” he asked in
                            substance, 1st. Whether Great Britain would enter into a treaty with
                            Nicaragua similar to that negotiated by the United States? 2d. Whether
                            Great Britain would enter into treaty with New Grenada guaranteeing the
                            neutrality of the railway then under construction? 3d. Whether the
                            obstruction of the Mosquito protectorate would be removed? This note was
                            never answered formally in London, but negotiations were transferred to
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>Meantime, and in the autumn of 1849, Sir Henry Bulwer had succeeded Mr.
                            Crampton in Washington, and, soon after his arrival, commenced
                            negotiations with Mr. Clayton for a treaty for the protection of a
                            canal.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th January, 1850, Sir Henry Bulwer wrote to Lord Palmerston,
                            saying: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    States in this matter has arisen from its newly acquired
                                    possession in the Pacific, and the project of an American
                                    company to form a water communication between the two oceans,
                                    passing through the lake of Nicaragua and the river San Juan;
                                    this company having obtained from the state of Nicaragua the use
                                    of its lakes and territory for this purpose, and the use also of
                                    the river San Juan, to which Nicaragua lays claim. * * * But it
                                    so happens that while it is very difficult, not to say
                                    impossible, for Her Majesty’s Government to listen to those
                                    claims of Nicaragua, our decision with respect to which has been
                                    already openly taken, there is no difficulty, I believe,

                                    be almost as desirous as the United States to see established. *

                            Palmerston’s criticism the full project of a treaty. Extracts from the
                            covering dispatch fully explain what the treaty was intended to
                            accomplish: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    was, however, impossible for the contemplated scheme to be

                                    the mouth of the San Juan River was in the hands of another

                                    providing for its security. * * * It is with such views that the

                            its provisions and in most of its language identical with the treaty
                            subsequently concluded, with one marked exception. In the project,
                            Article VII stopped with the general provision to give encouragement and

                        <p>The Clayton-Bulwer treaty was concluded on the 19th of the following
                            April, and I think it will not be denied that the object which President
                            Taylor, Mr. Clayton, Sir Henry Bulwer, and Lord Palmerston had in view
                            in making it was primarily and mainly this: To insure at the earliest
                            possible moment the completion of the particular ship-canal for which a
                            concession had been made by Nicaragua to citizens of the United States
                            on the 29th of August, 1849. All the interviews of which accounts remain
                            and all the correspondence relate to this particular canal and to no
                            other. As if to make assurance doubly sure, the project of a treaty
                            which Sir Henry Bulwer sent to Lord Palmerston the 3d of February being
                            found doubtful or insufficient in this respect, was so amended between
                            that time and the 19th April as to make it practically certain that that
                            grant would be accepted by both governments as the one covered by the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>It was to this particular canal that were to be applied all the
                            provisions of the first article in the treaty relating to the
                            fortification of the canal, the control over it, and exclusive advantage
                            in it; of the second article, relating to blockade, detention, or
                            capture; of the third and fourth articles, relating to protection during
                            construction and to free ports; of the fifth article, in regard to a
                            guaranty of neutrality; of the sixth article, with regard to treaties
                            with other states and the use of the good offices of the high
                            contracting parties; and of the seventh article as already noticed; but
                            if under the provisions of the seventh article the claims of the holders
                            of this particular concession should be set aside, then each government
                            reserved to itself the right to determine whether its interests required
                            it to afford protection to the holders of any other concession.</p>
                        <p>The two governments did, however, subsequently come to a harmonious <pb

                            grant by Nicaragua, the one contemplated by the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The company was organized, and Colonel Childs, who had been chief
                            engineer of the canals of the State of New York, was sent to Nicaragua
                            to make a survey. He arrived there in August, 1850, and in 1852 his
                            report was received, printed, and laid before the Secretary of War by
                            direction of the President, who detailed Colonel Abert and
                            Lieutenant-Colonel Turnbull, of the United States Army, to examine it
                            and give their opinions upon it. They approved the report on the 20th
                            March, 1852.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th June, in the same year, Mr. Lawrence informed Lord Malmesbury
                            of these facts, and requested Her Majesty’s Government to appoint
                            engineers of skill and experience to examine it on the part of that
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lawrence was on the 30th July informed that an officer of the royal
                            engineers and an eminent civil engineer had been appointed for that
                            purpose, and on the 13th August their report was transmitted to Mr.
                            Lawrence by Lord Malmesbury. The report was favorable, and a combination
                            of British capitalists was made in contemplation of united action with
                            American shareholders in the construction of the canal. For reasons
                            which need not now be repeated, but principally because of the
                            discussion which immediately began as to the clauses of the treaty
                            relating to settlements in British Honduras, the project failed, and no
                            canal was ever constructed under that grant.</p>
                        <p>A line of steamers was put on and run for many years, carrying passengers
                            between New York and San Francisco. The expedition of Walker into
                            Nicaragua terminated this line. The grant was revoked, the steamers were
                            seized; the stockholders received no benefit from their property, and
                            although the company nominally exists, it has been, practically
                            superseded by subsequent grants from Nicaragua to other companies.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed in the treaty that the parties should invite other
                            states to enter into similar stipulation, to the end that they might
                            share in the “honor and advantage of having contributed to a work of
                            such general interest and importance as the canal herein contemplated,”
                            to wit, that by the Nicaragua route.</p>
                        <p>It is to be observed that if other nations were to become parties to the
                            enterprise it was only on the joint invitation of both the United States
                            and Great Britain; but the President regards the provision as lapsed by
                            the failure to construct the canal to which it referred, and by the fact
                            before stated that experience has shown that no joint protectorate for
                            any canal across the isthmus is requisite. The canal, however, now in
                            question is on the Panama and not on the Nicaragua route.</p>
                        <p>The remaining subject of the treaty is contained in the eighth article,
                            which relates to a canal or railway across the isthmus other than by the
                            Nicaragua route, as by way of Tehuantepec or Panama, and it is this
                            provision of the treaty which has occasioned this correspondence. The
                            article provides as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>It is to be here observed that the Government of the United States has a
                            treaty with New Grenada, now a part of the United States of Colombia,
                            entered into in 1846, by which free transit is guarantied to the
                            citizens of the United States across the Isthmus of Panama upon any mode
                            of communication that may be constructed, subject to no-duties or
                            burdens but such as may be imposed upon citizens of New Grenada; and by
                            which, in order to secure the tranquil and constant enjoyment of these
                            advantages, the United States guaranteed, positively and efficaciously,
                            the <hi rend="italic">perfect neutrality of the isthmus</hi>, with the
                            view that free transit from sea to sea might not be interrupted or
                            embarrassed, and also guaranteed the rights of sovereignty and property
                            which New Grenada (now the United States of Colombia) had and possesses
                            over said territory.</p>
                        <p>By this treaty with New Grenada the United States claim to occupy a
                            peculiar relation to the means of transit by railroad or canal across
                            the isthmus, within the territories of the United States of Colombia; a
                            relation which cannot justly be superseded by the intervention of other
                            states without the consent of the United States, duly and properly
                            obtained. A protectorate of this kind is, like government, necessarily
                            exclusive in its character, and implies a right and duty to make it
                            effective. There may be a joint protectorate engaged in by mutual
                            convention of different States, but the protectorate itself must be a
                            unit. The treaty with New Grenada of 1846 still remains in full force.
                            If Great Britain should desire to be united with the Government of the
                            United States in that guaranty, of course, it would require the consent
                            of the United States of Colombia and of this government, and a
                            convention to that end, the terms of which should be made agreeable to
                            the parties.</p>
                        <p>Article VIII of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty relates only to those projects
                                <hi rend="italic">now</hi> [1850] proposed to be established; and
                            expressly contemplates some further “treaty stipulation” on the part of
                            Great Britain with the United States of America and New Grenada, now the
                            United States of Colombia, before Great Britain can join the United
                            States in the protectorate of the canal or railway by the Panama route.
                            No such treaty stipulation has been made or has been proposed by Great
                            Britain. Since the ratification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, for thirty
                            years the United States, under the treaty of 1846 with New Grenada, has
                            extended protection to the transit from sea to sea by the Panama
                            Railway.</p>
                        <p>Should Her Majesty’s Government, after obtaining the consent thereto of
                            the United States of Colombia, claim, under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
                            the right to join the United States in the protection of the existing
                            Panama Railway, or any future Panama canal, the United States would
                            submit that experience has shown that no such joint protectorate is
                            requisite; that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is subject to the provisions
                            of the treaty of 1846 with New Grenada, while it exists, which treaty
                            obliges the United States to afford, and secures to it the sole
                            protectorate of any transit by the Panama route; and if Great Britain
                            still claimed the right to join in the protectorate the United States
                            would then determine whether the “treaty stipulations” proposed by Great
                            Britain regulating that joint protectorate were just; and, if so,
                            whether the length of time during which Great Britain has concurred in
                            the protection of the Panama route under the treaty with New Grenada has
                            or has not relieved the United States from any obligation to accept a
                            proposal from the government to join in the guarantee.</p>
                        <p>I may then state the President’s views on the whole subject, which I do
                            with an assurance that they will meet with a candid consideration <pb
                                n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0354"/>from Lord Granville, and with
                            the hope that they may be substantially concurred in by Her Majesty’s
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Clayton-Bulwer treaty was concluded to secure a thing which did not
                            exist, and which now never can exist. It was to secure the construction
                            of a canal under the grant of 1849 from Nicaragua that the United States
                            consented to waive the exclusive and valuable rights which had been
                            given to them; that they consented to agree with Great Britain that they
                            would not occupy, fortify, colonize, or assume dominion over any part of
                            Central America; and that they consented to admit Her Majesty’s
                            Government at some future day to a share in the protection which they
                            have exercised over the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
                        <p>The Government and people of the United States, though rich in land and
                            industry, were poor in money and floating capital in 1850. The scheme
                            for a canal, even without the complications of the Mosquito
                            protectorate, was too vast for the means of the Americans of that day,
                            who numbered then considerbly less than one-half of their numbers
                            to-day. They went to England, which had what they had not, surrendered
                            their exclusive privileges, offered an equal share of all they had in
                            those regions in order, as expressed in the seventh article of the
                            treaty “that no time should be unnecessarilly lost in commencing and
                            constructing the said canal.” Through no fault of theirs time was
                            unnecessarily lost, the work was never begun, and the concession
                            failed.</p>
                        <p>The President does not think that the United States are called upon by
                            any principle of equity to revive those provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer
                            treaty which were specially applicable to the concession of August,
                            1849, and apply them to any other concession which has been since or may
                            hereafter be made. The conditions of 1882 are not those of 1852. The
                            people of the United States have now abundance of surplus capital for
                            such enterprises, and have no need to call upon foreign capitalists. The
                            legislative branch of the Government of the United States may also
                            desire to be free to place the credit of the United States at the
                            service of one or more of these enterprises. The President does not feel
                            himself warranted in making any engagement or any admission respecting
                            the extinct provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty which would prevent
                            or interfere with such a purpose. On the contrary, frankness requires
                            him to say that as the persons who held the grant which the United
                            States understood to be accepted by the two governments under the
                            provisions of the treaty have not “carried out the proposed enterprise,”
                            the United States esteem themselves competent to refuse to afford their
                            protection jointly with Great Britain to any other persons or company,
                            and hold themselves free hereafter to protect any interoceanic
                            communication in which they or their citizens may become interested in
                            such way as treaties with the local sovereign powers may warrant and
                            their interests may require.</p>
                        <p>There are some provisions of the treaty which the President thought might
                            be advantageously retained. With this purpose the present correspondence
                            was opened by the note to you of the 19th November last, in which these
                            points were indicated. The President is still ready on the part of the
                            United States to agree that the reciprocal engagements respecting the
                            acquisition of territory in Central America, and respecting the
                            establishment of a free port at each end of whatever canal may be
                            constructed, shall continue in force, and to define by agreement the
                            distance from either end of the canal where captures may be made by a
                            belligerent in time of war, and with this definition thus made to keep
                            alive the second article of the treaty. He hopes that Lord Granville on
                                <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0355"/>future consideration may
                            not be averse to revising his opinion that such agreements would not be
                            beneficial.</p>
                        <p>To the suggestion made by Lord Granville, at the close of this note of
                            January 7, that the United States should take the initiative in an
                            invitation to other powers to participate in an agreement based upon the
                            convention of 1850, the President is constrained, by the considerations
                            already presented, to say that the United States cannot take part in
                            extending such an invitation, and to state with entire frankness, that
                            the United States would look with disfavor upon an attempt at a concert
                            of political action by other powers in that direction.</p>
                        <p>It is not necessary to observe that there is no provision of the
                            Clayton-Bulwer treaty which authorizes Great Britain to invite, or
                            obliges the United States to accept, the aid of other nations to protect
                            or to guarantee the neutrality of the Panama route.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately the want of harmony in the views of the two governments can
                            have at present no injurious influence. No canal yet exists across the
                            isthmus, and in the natural course of events some time must elapse
                            before one can be constructed; meanwhile the points of divergence
                            between Her Majesty’s Government and that of the United States may
                            disappear. The President hopes that long before the subject becomes one
                            of practical importance Her Majesty’s Government may be brought to see
                            that the interests of Great Britain and of the United States in this
                            matter are identical, and are best promoted by the peaceful policy which
                            he has marked out for this country.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the diversity of opinion which now exists will not in
                            any wise impair the good understanding happily existing between the
                            people and Governments of the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                        <p>You will read this dispatch to Lord Granville, and if he desires to have
                            a copy of it you may leave one with him.</p>
                        <p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            reception of your instruction No. 368 of the 8th of May last, stating
                            the position of the Government of the United States in relation to
                            questions growing out of the (so called) Clayton-Bulwer treaty. It
                            arrived on the 27th ultimo, when the members of the government were
                            leaving town for the Whitsuntide holidays. I have had no opportunity of
                            seeing Lord Granville until yesterday, when I had an interview with him
                            by appointment at the foreign office. I read the dispatch to him and
                            left a copy of it with him at his request, agreeably to your directions.
                            I have already informed you of this by cable.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my telegram of the 20th of
                            May last, in which I stated that I had read your No. 366 to Lord
                            Granville and left a copy with him on the 18th of that month, I have the
                            honor to acquaint you that I have just received a letter from his
                            lordship in reply to that dispatch, a copy of which I herewith
                            inclose.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that of the six alleged American citizens to which
                            you invited my attention in that dispatch on the 25th of April last,
                            Brophy has accepted his release on the condition proposed by the lord
                            lieutenant, and McInerny has also been released from custody.</p>
                        <p>The remaining four suspects still remain in prison, viz, O’Mahoney,
                            McSweeney, Slattery, and Gannon.</p>
                        <p>The certificate of naturalization which O’Mahoney produced to me
                            expressly stated that it was granted on the ground of his service in the
                            Navy, which was so clearly irregular that I do not consider him entitled
                            to the privileges of American citizenship.</p>
                        <p>In the lists of persons detained in prison June 5,1882, under the statute
                            44 Victoria, c. 4, a copy of which accompanied Lord Granville’s note,
                            and which I also inclose herewith, I do not find the names of any
                            persons who have been arrested under that act and who have applied to me
                            for protection excepting those mentioned in Lord Granville’s
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the British Government do not entertain the
                            intention of bringing the four persons still remaining in prison to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Her Majesty’s Government have had
                                under consideration Mr. Frelinghuysen’s dispatch of the 25th of
                                April, a copy of which you were good enough to communicate to me on
                                the 18th of May, in which the Secretary of State has invited
                                attention to the cases of Messrs. O’Mahoney, McSweeney, McInerny,
                                Slattery, Brophy, and Gannon, who are stated to be American citizens
                                and have been detained in prison under the protection of person and
                                property (Ireland) act, 1881. I have now the honor to state to you
                                that I have been informed that in the case of five of these
                                prisoners, namely, O’Mahoney, McSweeney, McInerny, Slattery, and
                                Brophy, an order was issued by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on the
                                24th of April last that they should be discharged from custody on
                                the terms of their leaving Ireland for America.</p>
                            <p>They all at the time refused to accede to these terms and were
                                consequently detained in custody. Brophy, however, subsequently
                                consented to go to America, and has been since released, and
                                McInerny has also been released from custody.</p>
                            <p>Some doubt existed at the time as to the claim set up by John Gannon
                                as an American citizen, but on being satisfied on this point later,
                                his excellency made the same order in his case as that made in the
                                case of the other five prisoners, viz, that he should be discharged
                                if he consented to leave Ireland for the United States; a permission
                                of which the prisoner has not availed himself.</p>
                            <p>Of the persons, therefore, on whose behalf application has been made
                                by the Government of the United States, four still remain in
                                custody, viz, O’Mahoney, McSweeney, Slattery, and Gannon.</p>
                            <p>In response to the desire expressed by the Government of the United
                                States to be furnished with information as to the causes of their
                                detention, I have the honor to forward herewith duplicate copies of
                                a paper which has been laid before Parliament, <pb n="285"
                                    xml:id="pg_285" facs="0357"/>containing a list of all persons
                                detained in prison under statute 44 Vict., c. 4, in which are given
                                in a separate column the grounds stated for their arrest in the
                                warrant sunder which they are detained.</p>
                            <p>I beg leave to refer you to Nos. 4, 13, 27, and 74, in this list,
                                under which will be found the particulars laid before Parliament as
                                to the arrest of Messrs. O’Mahoney, McSweeney, Slattery, and

                            <p>In conclusion I have the honor to state to you that at present Her
                                Majesty’s Government do not entertain the intention of bringing
                                these prisoners to trial.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose two copies of
                            the prevention of crime (Ireland) act, which has just received the royal
                            assent.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>It is the revival of the alien act as part of the crimes act which alone
                            directly concerns our relations with this government. Questions are
                            likely to arise under it which will need to be treated with extreme
                            delicacy and discretion. It will be rather to the personal application
                            of the act than to its principle that objection will lie, and I should
                            be glad to be armed beforehand with the opinion of the President as to
                            what my general line of action should be under these new circumstances.
                            There must be a great number of naturalized American citizens in Ireland
                            besides those that have rendered themselves obnoxious to the local
                            authorities, and the alien clauses of the act may very probably
                            strengthen the temptation of private enmity to bring false accusations,
                            as it undoubtedly increases the opportunity for them. I have every
                            reason to believe that under the present government the act will be
                            applied with caution and discrimination, but a change of ministry may
                            take place at any moment. In any event, however, I think myself safe in
                            predicting that the provisions of the act will be brought to bear only
                            in the cases of men who have made, or may make, themselves particularly
                            prominent by incitement to disorder or defiance of authority.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In acknowledging your No. 393 of July 10,
                            1882, I am gratified to learn that two of the six alleged American
                            citizens, to whom I invited your attention in my No. 366 of April 25
                            last, have been released. I regret, however, to learn that the other
                            four are still detained, and that the British Government does not
                            entertain the intention of bringing them to trial. I have again to
                            instruct you to say to Lord Granville that as these prisoners have been
                            so long detained the President hopes that the British Government may now
                            feel justified in instructing the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to exercise
                            the powers intrusted to him by the first section of the act of March 2,
                            1881, to order an early trial in these cases.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 402, of the
                            19th of July last, I have the honor to forward herewith the copy of a
                            letter which I received to-day from Lord Granville, by which it appears
                            that the lord lieutenant of Ireland, on the 14th of July, caused it to
                            be intimated to Messrs. O’Mahoney, McSweeney, and Slattery that he was
                            still willing to allow them to be released on the terms of their leaving
                            the country, but they have all refused to accept this offer, and his
                            excellency could not consistently with his duty allow them to be at
                            large in Ireland, in the present state of the country.</p>
                        <p>Lord Granville further states that an unconditional release had been
                            granted to John Gannon, and that William Brophy, who had consented to go
                            to America, and at one time was making arrangements for his departure,
                            had not taken any further steps in that direction. The reason he would
                            give for this is probably the want of means as stated in my dispatch of
                            the 19th July.</p>
                        <p>Lord Granville calls my attention to the cause of Brophy’s imprisonment,
                            that he is declared to be reasonably suspected of being guilty, as
                            principal, of the crime of murder.</p>

                                address to you on the 8th ultimo, relative to the case of six
                                American citizens who have been detained in prison under the
                                protection of person and property (Ireland) act, 1881, it was stated
                                that as Messrs. O’Mahoney, McSweeney, Slattery, and Gannon had not
                                accepted the terms on which their discharge had been offered to
                                them, they were still detained in custody; and that Messrs. McInerny
                                and Brophy had been released.</p>
                            <p>I now beg leave to acquaint you that I am informed that on the 14th
                                ultimo his exeellency the viceroy of Ireland caused it to be
                                intimated to the three first named of these prisoners that he was
                                still willing to allow them to be released on the terms of their
                                leaving the country, but that they have refused to accept this
                                offer, and his excellency cannot consistently with his duty allow
                                them to be at large in Ireland in present state of the country.</p>
                            <p>Upon a full consideration of the case of John Gannon, his excellency
                                has ordered his unconditional release.</p>
                            <p>With regard to William Brophy, who, as was stated in my letter of the
                                8th of July, had consented to go to America, and at one time was
                                making arrangements for his departure, I am informed that he has not
                                taken any further steps in that direction. For the particulars of
                                the grounds stated in the warrant for this man’s arrest, I beg leave
                                to refer you to No. 204 in the list laid before Parliament, of which
                                a copy accompanied my letter of the 8th ultimo. You will observe
                                that he is there declared to be reasonably suspected of being guilty
                                as principal of the crime of murder.</p>

                            been liberated, I inclose herewith for your information a copy of a

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Permit me to thank, through you,
                                the Department you represent, for the prompt service rendered in the
                                case of our editorial correspondent in Ireland, Stephen Joseph
                                Meany, who was arrested at Ennis. We received a cable message last
                                evening announcing that he had been discharged from custody,
                                doubtless in consequence of the representations made in his behalf
                                by Minister Lowell, at your request.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Meany is a naturalized citizen, and has for many years been a
                                resident and a voter in this State. On two previous journeys to
                                Ireland, as our representative, he experienced no personal
                                molestation, although his correspondence was examined repeatedly and
                                only forwarded after considerable delay by the English postal
                                authorities. I inclose you the cablegrams received by us on the
                                subject, which contain all the information at hand, and which I
                                would respectfully request you to investigate.</p>
                            <p>You will observe that, in addition to his arrest, his trunks were
                                searched and he was only permitted to go on giving bonds for good
                                “behavior.” As he has at all times, both at home and abroad,
                                demeaned himself as a quiet and respectable American citizen, it is
                                difficult to understand the nature of the information which led to
                                his arrest as a “dangerous character.” He has never, to my
                                knowledge, or that of his most intimate friends, been guilty of any
                                conduct which could be construed as being incentive to sedition
                                against Her Majesty’s Government, or to a breach of the peace,
                                either at home or abroad. I have written to Mr. Meany to furnish
                                Minister Lowell with evidences of his American citizenship, his
                                passport, and all the other information in his possession bearing on
                                the question of his status abroad at the present time.</p>
                            <p>At 2.30 p.m. to-day I received the first instalment of Mr. Meany’s
                                editorial correspondence, the envelope containing which bears
                                evidence of having been opened in transit and resealed by the United
                                States postal authorities. The envelope is inclosed herewith,
                                together with other matters bearing on the subject of the recent
                                arrest.</p>
                            <p>Very truly, yours,</p>

                            <p>Simultaneously with the tidings of the liberation of Henry George
                                comes the announcement that Stephen J. Meany, the New York Star’s
                                special correspondent in Ireland, has been arrested at Ennis,
                                whither he went to visit his relatives, and whence he was about to
                                make a tour of the most distressed portions of the West of Ireland,
                                where evictions are being carried on at a wholesale rate. These
                                arbitrary seizures are the first fruit of the new repression act,
                                and their manifest intent is to intimidate American citizens from
                                visiting Ireland. Mr. Meany was arrested on Thursday while in bed in
                                Brennan’s Hotel, in Ennis, County Clare, under a warrant issued by
                                Earl Spencer, charging Mr. Meany with being a dangerous character.
                                Mr. Meany was subsequently released on giving bail for his good
                                behavior for six months. Mr. Meany’s trunk was searched for
                                treasonable documents, but none were found.</p>

                                <p>It now appears that Stephen J. Meany was arrested on Thursday
                                    night at Brennan’s Hotel, Ennis, under a warrant of the lord
                                    lieutenant, charging him with being a dangerous character. He
                                    was detained all night at the police barracks and discharged in
                                    the morning on giving bail for good behavior for six months. His
                                    trunks were searched but nothing of a treasonable character was
                                    found in them.</p>

                                intelligence from London of yesterday by which the public <pb

                                arrest in Ireland of Mr. Henry George, a distinguished citizen of
                                the United States, and for many years past a resident of the city of
                                San Francisco, and State of California.</p>
                            <p>Mr. George is my personal friend, whom I have known favorably and
                                intimately for many years. He is a journalist and author of very
                                high order; a gentleman of rare intellectual acquirements, and of
                                irreproachable private character; a native-born citizen of the
                                United States; and his second arrest in Ireland is a matter which,
                                in my judgment, should be promptly and fully inquired into by the
                                proper authorities of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Congress being not now in session, and its members constituting the
                                California delegation having repaired to their homes, leaves the
                                case of Mr. George without remedy through his immediate
                                representatives in Congress; and for this reason, among others, I
                                therefore, as his personal friend (a native-born citizen of the
                                United States, and resident of California, temporarily sojourning in
                                Washington City), do request, that you may be pleased to immediately
                                instruct the United States minister, resident in London, to
                                officially and promptly and fully inquire into all the circumstances
                                and causes of these two arrests of Mr. Henry George in Ireland; the
                                character and nature of the charges preferred against him, if any;
                                and promptly and fully to report to your Department in regard
                                thereto.</p>
                            <p>This constant re-occurrence of the arrest, without adequate cause, of
                                peaceable and law-abiding citizens of the United States while
                                traveling through the isles over which the flag of England floats,
                                is a matter of grave public concern, and one which demands the first
                                attention of the proper authorities of the United States; and the
                                friends of Mr. George confidently believe, if his arrest and
                                confinment in an English prison have taken place, in these cases,
                                either without sufficient or just authority of law, or without good
                                causes first clearly established, that the United States will not
                                permit so gross a wrong upon American citizens abroad to pass either
                                unnoticed or undredressed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatches Nos. 439 and
                            445, and to several telegrams from the Department, I have the honor to
                            report my action in the cases of Messrs. Meany and George, arrested in
                            Ireland, under the prevention of crimes act.</p>
                        <p>I have already in my dispatch No. 433, of the 24th instant, informed you
                            of what I had done in respect to the first named of these cases,
                            previous to that date.</p>
                        <p>On the 21st of August instant, I received from Mr. Davis, the acting
                            secretary, the following message: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Is there any information in regard to the case of George, and is
                                    he still under arrest?</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0363"/>
                        <p>As I had not heard from Mr. George personally, or from the consul of the
                            foreign office, I replied, on the 22d, as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Only information I have as regards George is contained in
                                    newspaper reports. I believe he is at liberty.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On the 23d of August, I received the following additional telegram from
                            Mr. Davis: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Use all diligence to find out where George is, and telegraph
                                    facts of case at once.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On the 24th of August, I addressed the following telegram to Mr. Barrows,
                            the consul at Dublin: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Will you kindly inquire at the proper office as to the present
                                    whereabouts of Henry George, arrested at Loughrea, and
                                    afterwards at Athenry, and the reason of his arrest?</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On the 26th of August, Mr. Barrows wrote me: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The under secretary does not know where Mr. George is at present,
                                    but promised to send me the particulars of his arrest. I shall
                                    forward same soon as received. I was informed unofficially that
                                    Mr. George was arrested under the crimes act, for being seen in
                                    the company of suspicious persons, but was not detained more
                                    than one or two hours.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Mr. Barrows has not yet sent me the account from the under secretary,
                            which was promised.</p>
                        <p>On the 14th of August, in order to prevent delay, I ventured to
                            transgress official rules, and addressed Mr. Trevelyan, the Irish
                            secretary, directly, without asking the intervention of the foreign
                            office, in relation to the arrest of Mr. Meany. Mr. Trevelyan was absent
                            upon a tour in Ireland, and did not reply to my letter. I addressed him
                            again on the 24th instant, in respect to both Mr. Meany and Mr. George.
                            Not having heard from him, I telegraphed to you on the 26th instant, as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>No answer yet from Irish secretary in regard to Meany or
                                    George.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>On the 27th instant, however, I received a <hi rend="italic"
                                >confidential</hi> reply from Mr. Trevelyan.* * *</p>
                        <p>I have been waiting for fuller information before addressing Lord
                            Granville upon the subject of these arrests, but as I did not think
                            proper to delay any longer communicating what I presumed would be the
                            views of the President on this subject, I have written him a letter a
                            copy of which I inclose, and which will be sent to him forthwith.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have delayed addressing your
                                lordship on the subject of the recent arrests of Mr. Henry George, a
                                well-known writer on political economy, at Athenry, and Mr. Stephen
                                J. Meany, editor of a respectable New York newspaper, at Ennis, two
                                American citizens traveling in Ireland on perfectly legitimate
                                business, so far as I can learn, because I have been in the daily
                                hope of obtaining fuller and more authentic particulars on which to
                                base a remonstrance.</p>
                            <p>I beg to ask your lordship’s attention to the peculiar features of
                                hardship which characterize these two cases. Mr. George was twice
                                arrested, and though shortly discharged, from lack, apparently, of
                                any ground of reasonable suspicion, must naturally resent this
                                repeated violation of his rights as the citizen of a friendly
                                nation, and this public indignity which he was carelessly made to
                                suffer.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Meany, who was arrested at midnight and taken from his bed, was
                                also released <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0364"/>after a short
                                imprisonment, but is still subjected to a qualified imprisonment, by
                                baring been put under bonds and pointed out to the special
                                surveillance of the police,</p>
                            <p>Your lordship will observe that these cases seem to differ
                                essentially from former arrests of American citizens, concerning
                                which so much correspondence has already passed between the
                                Government of the United States and that of Her Majesty, and are
                                even more likely than those to enlist the sympathy of the American
                                people, peculiarly sensitive as they are in regard to such
                                infringements of personal liberty, especially in the case of adopted
                                citizens.</p>
                            <p>As I am well aware that no one would more sincerely deplore than your
                                lordship any occurrence which would have the untoward effect of
                                impairing, in any way, the friendly relations now so happily
                                existing between our respective countries, and as I am persuaded
                                that the arrests, of which I have to complain, are due to the
                                indiscreet zeal of subordinate officials, I venture to express the
                                hope that Her Majesty’s Government will take steps to prevent the
                                future occurrence of such unfortunate incidents, which they would be
                                the first to regret.</p>

                            extract from the Times newspaper of yesterday, in which it is stated
                            that Mr. Meany informed the court at Ennis, the day before, that he was
                            acting, in the proceedings he was taking, under instructions from this
                            legation and on the advice of the American Government. This was repeated

                        <p>As the only communication we have had with Mr. Meany was to inform him

                            correct at once this statement which he is reported to have made, and I
                            accordingly addressed a note to Lord Granville on the subject which was
                            delivered at the foreign office this morning and a copy of which I

                            <p>The press association Ennis correspondent says that Mr. Stephen J.

                                own recognizances, attended yesterday at the police barracks in
                                accordance with instructions from the American legation in London to
                                surrender to his bail. The subinspector, however, declined to take
                                any action and referred him to Mr. Purcell, stipendiary magistrate.
                                Mr. Meany, acting on advice from the American Government, is
                                determined to test the legality of his arrest, and has adopted this
                                mode of bringing the question to a decisive issue.</p>

                                correct a statement which appears in the Times and other newspapers
                                this morning, that Mr. Stephen J. Meany, who was <pb n="293"

                                instructed by this legation to surrender to his bail. No
                                instructions of any sort have been given to him by this

                            <p>It is further stated that Mr. Meany, acting on advice from the

                                arrest, and has adopted this mode of bringing the question to a
                                decisive issue. I cannot believe that any such advice has been
                                offered by my government to Mr. Meany. It certainly has not been

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have, in an instruction, No. 438, of the
                            15th August last, acknowledged the receipt of your dispatch No. 398, of
                            the 14th July, in <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0366"/>relation to
                            the “Prevention of crime (Ireland) act,” recently passed by the British
                            Parliament.</p>
                        <p>The careful attention which you have evidently given to the subject, and
                            your just comments on the policy that could have dictated so
                            extraordinary a measure in a country whose traditional history in regard
                            to the freedom of the individual, the security of the domicile, and the
                            right of every man accused of crime to an impartial trial has formed its
                            crowning glory, relieve me from the necessity of giving you anything
                            more than general directions as to your future conduct in connection
                            with the cases affecting American citizens that may possibly come before
                            you. Nevertheless, I deem it proper, in the interest of our citizens and
                            in compliance with your own expressed desire to that effect, to put you
                            in possession of the general views of the President on this recent act
                            of the British Parliament—an act which he conceives may seriously affect
                            a large number of the citizens of this republic.</p>
                        <p>It is, as you justly observe, the revival of the alien act, as a part of
                            the crimes act, that more directly concerns us, and it is this feature
                            of the measure which has caused the President to feel anxiety as to its
                            possible effect on the business and social relations of American
                            citizens, particularly those of Irish birth.</p>
                        <p>Many Irish-American citizens have parents, brothers, and sisters resident
                            in Ireland, and whenever they learn of their destitution, as the most
                            effective mode of relief, they send a member of the family to Ireland
                            with the means to aid them. The possibility that persons in pursuit of
                            their lawful business enterprises, or on their mission of benevolence,
                            should come under the operation of the proceedings contemplated by
                            provisions of the new law, is much to be deprecated. The opportunities
                            for this kind of annoyance which the act affords for the gratification
                            of private enmity, as you justly remark, increases the grounds of this
                            apprehension, and when to this is added the superserviceable zeal of
                            local officials, it is hardly to be expected that an Irish-American
                            citizen, however innocent he might be in act and intention, should
                            consider his person or his property safe in that country. His private,
                            although temporary abode, may be forcibly visited by night or day, his
                            papers and his valuables may be taken from him and subjected to search,
                            and he may be ordered out of the country at the will of the executive
                            with the stigma of guilt upon him and without having had an opportunity
                            for hearing or trial. The President, moreover, cannot contemplate the
                            enforcement of this measure on mere suspicion against American citizens
                            without fears of its having an unhappy influence upon the good feeling
                            which exists between two great nations of common origin and common
                            language.</p>
                        <p>I need scarcely add that this government has no sympathy with the motives
                            or the methods of the class of indiscreet individuals, insignificant in
                            number, in this country whose ill directed zeal can neither serve the
                            cause of Ireland nor reflect credit oh the country of their adoption.
                            The law-abiding and peaceable American citizens of Irish birth should
                            not be exposed to suffer on their account.</p>
                        <p>The President, looking only to the interests of American citizens, has
                            deemed it proper that these suggestions should be transmitted to you in
                            view of any future contingency. It would be difficult, in the absence of
                            any actual case, to give you any more specific instructions. Much must
                            be left to your own judgment. Cases may arise when it will be necessary
                            for you to act at once without consulting the department; in such cases
                            the President trusts to your discretion.</p>
                        <p>You will, of course, keep the Department informed of whatever steps <pb
                                n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0367"/>you may find it necessary to
                            take in any and every case that may come before you, using the telegraph
                            for that purpose when you deem it expedient.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I lost no time in referring to the
                                Lord Lieutenant of Ireland the request contained in Mr. Lowell’s
                                note of the 29th ultimo, for an explanation of the circumstances
                                which led to the recent arrests in that country of two American
                                citizens, Mr. H. George and Mr. Stephen J. Meany, and I have now the
                                honor to lay before you the following statement:</p>
                            <p>With regard to Mr. George, who was arrested at Loughrea, in the
                                county Galway, on the 8th of August, I am informed that during the
                                three days that he was in that district his movements and the
                                persons with whom he associated raised a suspicion in the minds of
                                the local officers that he was there for an unlawful purpose.</p>
                            <p>At Ballinasloe he associated with an ex-suspect (named Mat Harris)
                                who has been for years identified prominently and mischievously with
                                organizations against law and order, and accordingly on his arrival
                                at Loughrea he was arrested by the police at 6.30 p.m., and brought
                                before the resident magistrate, who, however, after hearing the
                                case, ordered his release, which took place at 9 o’clock the same
                                evening. He went on the following day to Athenry, in the same
                                county, where he was seen the day after in close conversation with
                                persons who were well known to the police as being active in illegal
                                organizations. He was accordingly rearrested and brought before the
                                resident magistrate, who reported that he regarded Mr. George’s
                                presence and action in the county as calculated to endanger peace
                                and good order, and that he would have dealt with him under the 12th
                                section of the prevention of crime act, and put him under a rule of
                                bail, were it not a case which, in his opinion, would come under the
                                provisions of the alien act, should the Lord Lieutenant so decide.
                                Thereupon Mr. George was again released.</p>
                            <p>The movements of Mr. George, and the notorious character of some of
                                the persons with whom he associated on his arrival from the United
                                States, were calculated to excite suspicion as to the object of his
                                visit to Ireland, and I am convinced that the United States
                                Government will readily acknowledge that considerable allowance must
                                be made for the difficulties with which the officials charged with
                                the preservation of order in that country have to contend at the
                                present time. Nevertheless, in view of the information furnished by
                                Mr. Lowell, as to the character and pursuits of Mr, George, which
                                certainly rebut any presumption of unlawful designs on his part, I
                                can only express to you the regret of Her Majesty’s Government that
                                this incident should have occurred.</p>
                            <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0368"/>
                            <p>I beg now to refer to the case of Mr. Stephen J. Meany, who was
                                arrested at Ennis on the 10th August. Mr. Meany has long been under
                                the observation of the police, and with good reason, for he was, in
                                1867, convicted of treason, felony, and sentenced to 15 years penal
                                servitude. He was released in 1868 on the ground of ill health, and
                                since then has, on numerous occasions, delivered inflammatory and
                                seditious lectures.</p>
                            <p>It was proved before Mr. Purcell, the resident magistrate before whom
                                he was brought, that the last time he had been in Ennis, notices of
                                a disloyal nature were extensively posted throughout the town, and
                                he stated to Mr. Purcell that he was an Irish revolutionist. I may
                                also be allowed to remind you that he is invariably spoken of as
                                such in the Irish newspapers published in the United States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Purcell ordered him to give security himself in £50 and two
                                sureties of £25 to be of good behavior for a period of six months.
                                He was at the time unable to get sureties, and remained in the
                                police barracks till next morning, when he was released on the
                                required bail being entered into.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the suspicion which attaches to a person of Mr.
                                Meany’s character and antecedents, the lord lieutenant, after
                                carefully reviewing his past history, has come to the conclusion
                                that his presence in a proclaimed district, is rather to be
                                attributed to a desire for notoriety, and an attempt to regain some
                                weight, which he appears to have forfeited with persons of extreme
                                views than to “criminal intent” within the meaning of the twelfth
                                section of the prevention-of-crime act, and I have accordingly the
                                honor to inform you that Lord Spencer has issued instructions that
                                Mr. Meany is not to be interfered with by the police.</p>
                            <p>I trust that the above explanation, as well as the action of Her
                                Majesty’s Government in these two cases, will be appreciated by the
                                Government of the United States, and I have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge your No. 434, of the
                            30th August last, in relation to the arrest of Mr. Henry George.</p>
                        <p>This Department was first informed of Mr. George’s arrest by reports in
                            the newspapers, and then telegraphed to you. Mr. George being in Great
                            Britain, it was supposed he would communicate to you in writing the
                            facts as to his arrest and thus afford you a basis for proper action. He
                            however seems not to have written to you on the subject.</p>
                        <p>After his release he had, it is understood, a personal interview with
                            you, and the action thereupon promptly taken by you on the information
                            you possessed is justified by the statements herein contained.</p>
                        <p>His letter to the President, which at once appeared in the newspapers and
                            was referred to this Department, contained the first detailed statement
                            of the facts received here. As I understand that no similar
                            communication has been made to you, I inclose a copy of the letter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. George is a citizen of the United States and a gentleman well known
                            in this country. He states that in October, 1881, he landed in Ireland,
                            and since then he has traveled in Great Britain, always conducting
                            himself in a lawful manner. On the 8th of August last, he started from
                            Dublin for the west of Ireland, and on his arrival in the town of
                            Loughrea, at about six o’clock in the evening, he was seized by the
                            constabulary, carried to the police prison, where, in spite of his
                            declaration that he was a citizen of the United States, traveling
                            through the country without criminal intent or unlawful purpose, he was
                            held a close prisoner for about three hours, during which time his
                            baggage and person were searched and all his letters and papers minutely
                            examined. Finally a magistrate arrived, who was informed by the
                            subinspector that Mr. George had been arrested upon telegraphic
                            information that he was a <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0369"
                            />suspicious stranger; but Mr. George’s, request to be informed of the
                            source of the information and the ground of suspicion was refused. The
                            subinspector further stated that nothing suspicious had been found upon
                            Mr. George’s person or in his effects. He was thereupon discharged. Mr.
                            George immediately protested in what appears to be proper terms against
                            the treatment he had received, stating that he should have been given
                            reasonable opportunity for clearing up any suspicion which might have
                            been entertained of him before being arrested, imprisoned, and
                            searched.</p>
                        <p>On the following day Mr. George left Loughrea and proceeded to Athenry, a
                            town but a few miles distant in the same county and within the
                            jurisdiction of the same inspector and magistrate. There he remained one
                            night, and the next morning, after having visited the antiquities of the
                            place, was about to take the train for Galway, when he was again stopped
                            by a subinspector of constabulary and questioned as to his name,
                            nationality, business, from whence he had come, and whither he was
                            going. To all these questions he gave true answers, showing him to be an
                            American citizen of reputable character traveling upon lawful business.
                            Nevertheless, he was not permitted to take the train, but was again
                            placed under arrest, carried to the police barracks, and his clothing
                            and baggage again searched in the same manner as at Loughrea, and this
                            notwithstanding the fact that his arrest, search, and discharge at
                            Loughrea were known to the constabulary at Athenry. Mr. George, who in
                            the whole matter appears to have acted with discretion and within his
                            rights, demanded to be promptly taken before a magistrate, but was
                            detained a close prisoner until the arrival in the evening of the same
                            magistrate before whom he was examined at Loughrea; yet even then he was
                            not discharged until nearly midnight, and after again being subjected to
                            a long examination.</p>
                        <p>The President is persuaded that the acts so justly complained of must
                            have been committed without authority by subordinate officials of the
                            government. But while the first arrest was an annoyance to which
                            innocent travelers should not be subjected, and while the search and
                            examination were not justifiable, and seem to have been conducted in a
                            manner not consonant with the spirit of the laws both of Great Britain
                            and the United States, it is particularly to the repetition of the
                            indignity that the President wishes your attention to be directed.</p>
                        <p>The second arrest occurred within forty eight hours after the first; it
                            was made within the same jurisdiction by officers conversant with what
                            had occurred at Loughrea, who again searched his person and effects, and
                            again forced Mr. George to undergo an examination, and that before the
                            same magistrate who had interrogated him at Loughrea.</p>
                        <p>These acts indicate an intention on the part of the officials to subject
                            Mr. George to unnecessary personal annoyance.</p>
                        <p>Nor can this action be excused by the fact that he is alleged to have
                            visited the ruins of Athenry in company with the curate and another
                            gentleman, or that he was seen to enter shops of alleged “suspects.” The
                            examination of Mr. George at Loughrea had presumably shown the object of
                            his presence in Ireland, and should have convinced the authorities
                            without an additional examination that his visit to the ruined abbey was
                            one of curiosity, and that he entered the shops with the innocent
                            purpose of making purchases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. George’s conduct in Athenry appears to have been natural to a
                            traveler seeking information and amusement, and such as could not fairly
                            subject him to suspicion. While citizens of the United States traveling
                            or resident abroad are subject to the reasonable laws of the <pb n="298"
                                xml:id="pg_298" facs="0370"/>country in which they may be
                            sojourning, it is nevertheless their right to be spared such indignity
                            and mortification as the conduct of the officers at Loughrea and Athenry
                            seems to have visited upon Mr. George.</p>
                        <p>This government is loath to believe that the current rumors are true that
                            the behavior of the officers and magistrate was prompted by a prejudice
                            said to exist among the officials in Ireland against citizens of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In Great Britain, as in the United States, it has been a governmental
                            principle that the right of the individual to exemption from arrest or
                            search without good reason, and without the observance of form’s
                            calculated to insure that right, should be jealously guarded, and when
                            unfortunate events have demanded a temporary suspension or qualification
                            of the right great care has been exerted to avoid injustice or
                            unnecessary indignity.</p>
                        <p>The power given to subordinate officials by the “prevention-of-crime act”
                            is so great and the rights subjected to their discretion are so
                            important that foreign governments may reasonably require that so far as
                            their citizens, present in Ireland on legitimate and proper business,
                            are concerned, the individuals selected to administer that act should be
                            competent, well-informed, and unprejudiced. And should it appear that
                            these officials have in the case of such foreign citizens misused the
                            powers intrusted to them, they should be subjected to such condemnatory
                            action, and the citizen wronged should receive such amends as the facts
                            may warrant.</p>
                        <p>The President regrets to observe that, so far as he has the facts before
                            him, the officials at Loughrea, and Athenry seem to have fallen far
                            short of treating the rights of an innocent traveler with that respect
                            which he cannot doubt Her Majesty’s Government exacts of subordinate
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>It is not necessary now to comment upon the law under color of which
                            these arrests were made.</p>
                        <p>As you have already addressed a note to Lord Granville on this subject, a
                            reply will probably soon be received by you. It is trusted that the
                            tenor of that reply may prove satisfactory to this government and also
                            relieve Mr. George from any reproach the arrests are calculated unjustly
                            to cast upon him. More definite instructions, therefore, than those
                            herein contained and those heretofore received by you need not now be
                            given.</p>
                        <p>You are authorized, if you deem it advisable to do so, to read this
                            instruction to Lord Granville, and, should he desire it, to leave a copy
                            of it with him.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I desire respectfully to call your
                                attention to annoyances and indignities to which citizens of the
                                United States traveling in Ireland are exposed, and for that purpose
                                to state my own experience:</p>
                            <p>I am a citizen of the United States, born in the State of
                                Pennsylvania, and long a citizen of the State of California. I
                                landed first in Ireland on the 25th of October, 1881, and have, in
                                all parts of the dominions of the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland
                                that I have since visited, conducted myself in a lawful manner.</p>
                            <p>On the 8th instant I started from the city of Dublin for the west of
                                Ireland for the <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0371"/>purpose of
                                seeing the country and informing myself as to the condition of its
                                people. Immediately upon my arrival in the town of Loughrea, in the
                                county of Galway, at about six o’clock in the evening, I was seized
                                by the royal Irish constabulary and carried to the police prison,
                                where, in spite of my declaration that I was a citizen of the United
                                States of reputable character, traveling through the country without
                                criminal intent or unlawful purpose, I was held a close prisoner for
                                about three hours, during which time my baggage and person were
                                searched, and all my letters and papers minutely examined by a
                                number of constables. Finally a magistrate, to wit, Resident
                                Magistrate Byrne, was brought. The subinspector of constabulary
                                declared to him that he had arrested me upon telegraphic information
                                that I was a suspicious stranger, but my request to be informed of
                                the source of the information and ground of suspicion was refused.
                                The subinspector further stated that nothing suspicious had been
                                found upon my person or in my effects. The magistrate upon this
                                discharged me from custody.</p>
                            <p>I thereupon protested to the magistrate against the imprisonment and
                                indignity to which I had been subjected as unprovoked, unnecessary,
                                and unreasonable, declaring if any suspicion had been entertained of
                                me I should have been given reasonable opportunity of clearing it up
                                before being arrested, imprisoned, and searched.</p>
                            <p>On the following day I left Loughrea, and proceeded to Athenry, a
                                town but a few miles distant in the same county, and within the
                                district of the same police inspector and the jurisdiction of the
                                same resident magistrate. I staid there for the night and, having
                                during the next morning viewed the antiquities of the place, was
                                about taking the train to proceed to the town of Galway, when I was
                                stopped by a subinspector of constabulary and questioned as to my
                                name, nationality, business, from whence I had come, whither I was
                                going, &amp;c. To all of these questions I gave true answers—said
                                answers showing that I was an American citizen of reputable
                                character, traveling upon lawful business. Nevertheless, I was not
                                permitted to take the train, but was placed under arrest, carried to
                                the police barracks, and my clothing and luggage again searched in
                                the same manner as at Loughrea, notwithstanding the fact that my
                                arrest, search, and discharge at Loughrea were well known to the
                                constabulary at Athenry. And, although I demanded to be promptly
                                taken before a magistrate, I was detained a close prisoner until the
                                same magistrate before whom I had been taken at Loughrea had arrived
                                at Athenry in the evening; and then I was not discharged until
                                nearly midnight, and after a long and frivolous examination, having
                                been restrained of my liberty for about ten hours and compelled,
                                owing to the running of the trains, to lose nearly a day in my
                                journey.</p>
                            <p>The wantonness of this second arrest and imprisonment will appear not
                                merely from the fact that my arrest, search, and discharge at
                                Loughrea were well known to the constabulary at Athenry, but from
                                the reason for my arrest given to the magistrates by the
                                subinspector, who deposed that he had arrested me because I had in
                                the town of Athenry associated with suspicious persons, and who in
                                proof of this brought forward ten constables who testified that they
                                had seen me visiting the ruins of an old abbey in company with the
                                Rev. Father McPhilpin, the Catholic curate of Athenry, and an
                                English gentleman, Mr. James Leigh Joynes, of Eton College; and also
                                that they had seen me entering three shops on the main street (where
                                I had gone to make a small purchase), and which they averred were
                                the shops of “suspects,”<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, persons who
                                had been imprisoned on suspicion of having committed a certain crime
                                peculiar to this country, to wit: “Of having encouraged divers
                                persons to incite other persons to intimidate certain persons from
                                doing what they had a legal right to do.”</p>
                            <p>I would not, Mr. President, think of addressing you on this subject
                                were my case an isolated one, as then it would merely show an abuse
                                of power by certain individual officials. But, on the contrary, such
                                cases are constantly occurring, and many American citizens have
                                already, in various parts of this country, been subjected to similar
                                and even to much worse indignities and hardships. And this
                                evidently, not by accident, but because of being Americans; for
                                while it is true that the masses of the people of these islands
                                entertain towards us those feelings of friendship which it is to be
                                hoped may always exist, it is at the same time notorious that by
                                some of the local officials in certain parts of Ireland an American
                                is regarded as peculiarly a subject for suspicion and annoyance.</p>
                            <p>I fully realize, Mr. President, that it is the duty of an American
                                citizen in a foreign country to conform his conduct to the laws of
                                that country, and that he cannot expect exemption from such police
                                regulations as its government may deem necessary. But, at the same
                                time, I submit to you that it is due to their own dignity that the
                                United States should claim for their citizens traveling in countries
                                with which they maintain relations of amity, exemption from wanton
                                annoyances, unreasonable inquisitions, and imprisonment upon
                                frivolous pretexts.</p>
                            <p>Yet, I regret to say that the belief prevails here that the United
                                States take no interest in the treatment of their citizens in
                                foreign parts. American citizens have been imprisoned here for long
                                periods, without trial, and even without specific accusation, on the
                                mere suspicion of just such officials as those of whom I have had
                                experience, <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0372"/>as before
                                related, while the only action taken by the United States in the
                                matter, so far as known and currently reported here, is that
                                American consuls have visited these imprisoned citizens and
                                attempted to bribe them by offers of money into acknowledgment of
                                the justice of such arbitrary imprisonment, by agreeing to leave the
                                country as a condition of release. The contemptible position in
                                which the United States have thus been placed in the eyes of the
                                people of this country may be well imagined, but is not a pleasant
                                thing for an American citizen to portray.</p>
                            <p>Having discharged what I deem to be my duty in laying these facts
                                before you, as Chief Executive of the nation, for such consideration
                                as you may deem it your duty to give them,</p>

                                    and burned, though all official information in relation thereto
                                    was refused me, and insomuch as it is the belief of many of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acquaint you that on
                            the 21st of September last I received a telegram from you, of which the
                            following is the substance: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Ascertain accurately and inform us why an exception is made in
                                    the case of Brophy, who, it is understood, is still
                                    imprisoned.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I at once caused an unofficial inquiry to be made at the Irish office to
                            obtain the information you desired. There being no person there who
                            could answer the question, I addressed a note to Lord Granville on the
                            22d ultimo, of which I inclose a copy. Not having received an answer to
                            this note, Mr. Nadal, at my request, went to the foreign office and saw
                            Sir Julian Pauncefote. He was informed that a telegram had been sent to
                            Dublin on the subject, and that whenever the reply arrived it should be
                            communicated to me. Being still without an answer I addressed a second
                            note to Lord Granville on the 28th of September, and on the 30th of that
                            month I received a reply from his lordship on the subject. I inclose
                            copies of the communications.</p>
                        <p>I sent you a telegram on the 30th of September, to the effect that I was
                            only that morning informed, after repeated inquiries of foreign
                            minister, that Brophy was released on the 19th, and was then in
                            Dublin.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have just received a telegram
                                from Mr. Frelinghuysen of which the substance is as follows:</p>
                            <p>“Ascertain accurately and inform us why an exception is made in the
                                case of Brophy, who, it is understood, is still imprisoned.”</p>

                            <p>I beg leave to remind your lordship that this William Brophy is a

                                Ireland under the act for the protection of person and property, and
                                whose case has already been the subject of a correspondence between
                                your lordship and this legation. It has been stated in the public
                                journals that one William Brophy has been released from prison, but
                                either they have not learned this at Washington or there is some
                                question there as to the identity of the individual. May I therefore

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 279a of the 13th ultimo
                            I informed you that the United States minister at this court had
                            communicated to me the substance of a dispatch which he had received
                            from Mr. Blaine, then Secretary of State, on the subject of the
                            convention of the 19th April, 1850. Finding that Mr. Lowell was
                            authorized to give me a copy of this dispatch if I wished it, I
                            requested him to do so, and I have already forwarded to you a copy for
                            your information.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government have given their careful consideration to the
                            views set forth in this paper. They entirely agree in the statement made
                            towards its conclusion as to the cordial relations so happily existing
                            between the two countries, and as to the opportunity which this state of
                            things affords for a frank exposition of the views held by either
                            government without risk of misconstruction. They have no hesitation,
                            therefore, in proceeding to examine the grounds advanced by Mr. Blaine
                            for desiring a modification of the convention.</p>
                        <p>The principles upon which the whole argument of the dispatch is founded
                            are, as far as I am aware, novel in international law. If a discussion
                            of the subject on the abstract grounds of public right were deemed
                            useful or opportune, it would not be difficult to quote passages from
                            publicists of acknowledged authority in both countries in support of
                            this opinion. But for several reasons it will be better to treat the
                            matter from the side of the practical considerations which it involves,
                            without, of course, being precluded from reverting at any future stage,
                            in case of need, to its other aspect.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government cannot admit that the analogy which it is sought
                            to draw from the conduct of Great Britain in regard to the Suez Canal is
                            correct or justified by the facts. They have made no attempt to fortify
                            the island of Cyprus, or to establish it as an armed position on an
                            important scale, though they have an undoubted right to do so. The
                            fortress of Gibraltar, the island of Malta, and the military
                            establishment at Aden came into the possession of England at a date long
                            anterior to the time when the Mediterranean and the Red Sea could be
                            regarded as a military route to India. For years afterwards the whole
                            mass of reinforcements for India was sent by way of the Cape of Good
                            Hope. Nor has any serious addition been made to the strength of these
                            positions since the opening of the canal beyond what has been a natural
                            consequence of the improvements in military science. Although no doubt
                            well adapted by its situation to command the Straits of Bab-el-mandeb,
                            the island of Perim has not in any real sense been made a fortified
                            position. The fort and garrison on the island are, in fact, sufficient
                            only to protect the light-house, which has been erected there for the
                            general benefit of navigation, from possible attack by predatory
                            Arabs.</p>
                        <p>The Navy Department of the United States must be well aware that Her
                            Majesty’s Government have never sought to bar or even to restrict the
                            use of the canal by the naval forces of other countries, and that even
                            during the recent war between Russia and Turkey, when the canal itself
                            formed a portion of the territory of one of the belligerents, when the
                            seat of conflict was close at hand, and when British interests might in
                                <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0375"/>many other respects have
                            been nearly involved, they contented themselves with obtaining an
                            assurance that the sphere of operations should not be extended to the
                            canal.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government cordially concur in what is stated by Mr. Blaine
                            as regards the unexampled development of the United States on the
                            Pacific coast, and the capacity which they possess for further progress.
                            That development has been watched in this country with admiration and
                            interest, and will continue to be so regarded. But though in rapidity it
                            may, and probably has, exceeded the most sanguine calculation, Her
                            Majesty’s Government cannot look upon it in the light of an unexpected
                            event, or suppose that it was not within the view of the statesmen who
                            were parties on either side to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. The
                            declarations of President Monroe and of his cabinet, in 1823 and 1824,
                            whatever may be the view taken of their scope and bearing, and of the
                            admissibility of the principles which they involve, or which it is
                            sought to deduce from them, show at least that at that period—twenty-six
                            years anterior to the treaty now under discussion—there was a clear
                            prevision of the great future reserved to the Pacific coast. It is, in
                            the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, an inadmissible contention that
                            the regular and successful operation of causes so evident at the time,
                            and in their nature so irrepressible, should be held to have completely
                            altered the condition of affairs to the extent of vitiating the
                            foundations of an agreement which cannot be supposed to have been
                            concluded without careful thought and deliberation.</p>
                        <p>While recognizing to the fullest degree the extent to which the United
                            States must feel interested in any canal which may be constructed across
                            the Isthmus of Panama, Her Majesty’s Government would be wanting in
                            regard to their duty if they failed to point out that Great Britain has
                            large colonial possessions, no less than great commercial interests,
                            which render any means of unobstructed and rapid access from the
                            Atlantic to the North and South Pacific Oceans a matter for her also of
                            the greatest importance.</p>
                        <p>The development of these possessions and interests has steadily
                            continued, possibly with less rapidity, but on a scale which has some
                            relation even to that of the Pacific States. Her Majesty’s Government do
                            not wish to ignore the share which other nations have acquired in the
                            commerce of Central and South America, nor to exclude from consideration
                            the interest of those countries in any canal which may be made across
                            the isthmus. They are of opinion that such a canal, as the waterway
                            between two great oceans and between all Europe and Eastern Asia, is a
                            work which concerns not merely the United States or the American
                            Continent, but the whole civilized world. This is a view which finds its
                            expression in the VIth article of the treaty of 1850. Her Majesty’s
                            Government are as anxious as that of the United States that, while all
                            nations should enjoy their proper share in the benefits to be expected
                            from the undertaking, no single country should acquire a predominating
                            influence or control over such a means of communication; and they will
                            not oppose or decline any discussion for the purpose of securing on a
                            general international basis its universal and unrestricted use.</p>
                        <p>With all deference to the considerations which have prompted <hi
                                rend="italic">the proposals made in Mr. Blaine’s dispatch</hi>, Her
                            Majesty’s Government cannot believe that they would promote this object
                            or be beneficial in themselves. The relations of the United States with
                            the European powers are fortunately of a nature to give rise to no
                            feelings of suspicion or alarm. The general tendency of their foreign
                            policy gives good promise that they will so continue. But if provision
                            is to be made on one side for a different state of affairs, it must be
                            expected that the course thus <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0376"
                            />indicated will find its natural and logical counterpart on the other.
                            Her Majesty’s Government can conceive no more melancholy spectacle than
                            a competition among the nations holding West Indian possessions, and
                            others on the Central and South American Continent, in the construction
                            of fortifications to obtain the command over the canal and its
                            approaches, in the event of occasion arising for such a measure. They
                            cannot believe that it would be agreeable or convenient to any South
                            American state through which the canal may pass to find itself called
                            upon to admit a foreign power to construct and garrison on its territory
                            a succession of fortresses of increasing magnitude, designed to oppose
                            such attempts, even though that foreign power be a neighboring one, and
                            situated upon the same continent. And when the claim to do this is
                            accompanied by a declaration that the United States will always insist
                            on treating the water-way which shall unite the two oceans “as part of
                            her coast line,” it is difficult to imagine that the states to which the
                            territory lying between that water-way and the United States belongs can
                            practically retain as independent a position as that which they now
                            enjoy.</p>
                        <p>These are the consequences which, in the conviction of Her Majesty’s
                            Government, would almost certainly follow from a claim on the part of
                            the United States to assume the supreme authority over the canal and all
                            responsibility for its control. Her Majesty’s Government hold, on the
                            contrary, that the principles which guided the negotiators of the
                            convention of 1850 were intrinsically sound, and continue to be
                            applicable to the present state of affairs. Their wish would be that
                            those principles should receive the practical development which was
                            contemplated at the time; and that effect should be given to that
                            portion of the treaty which provides that the contracting parties shall
                            invite all other states with whom they have friendly intercourse to
                            enter into similar stipulations with them.</p>
                        <p>A certain amount of progress was made in this direction by the conclusion
                            of conventions with Honduras and Nicaragua by Great Britain in 1856 and
                            1860, and by the United States in 1864 and 1867, and by Nicaragua with
                            France in 1859, with the object of upholding the general principles
                            inserted in the treaty. During the period when there were still matters
                            to regulate with respect to Grey Town, the Bay Islands, the frontier of
                            British Honduras, and the protection of the Mosquito Indians, and when
                            the construction of a canal still seemed a contingency more or less
                            doubtful and remote, it was not strange that the engagement to address
                            other powers should have been allowed to remain dormant; but the project
                            of the canal has now assumed sufficient shape to render such an
                            application reasonable and pertinent.</p>
                        <p>Her Majesty’s Government believe that the extension of an invitation to
                            all maritime states to participate in an agreement based on the
                            stipulations of the convention of 1850 would obviate any objection that
                            may possibly be raised against it as not being adequate in its present
                            condition for the purpose for which it was designed. This course formed
                            the basis of Mr. Fish’s proposal to Dr. Cardenas, the Nicaraguan
                            minister, in 1877; and Her Majesty’s Government would gladly see the
                            United States again take the initiative in an invitation to the powers,
                            and will be prepared either to join it or to support and indorse it in
                            the way that may be found most fitting and convenient, provided it does
                            not in any way conflict with the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 296 of the 31st ultimo,
                            I have forwarded to you a copy of a dispatch from Mr. Blaine to the
                            United States minister at this court, containing further observations in
                            support of his arguments and proposals for a modification of the treaty
                            between this country and the United States of the 19th of April, 1850.
                            In this dispatch Mr. Blaine gives extracts from the correspondence which
                            passed between the two governments between 1856 and 1858, in consequence
                            of questions that arose as to the construction to be placed on certain
                            provisions of the treaty. Mr. Blaine seeks to establish from these
                            extracts that “the vexatious and imperfect character of the treaty has
                            been repeatedly recognized on both sides;” and he adds that the present
                            proposal of the United States Government “is to free it from those
                            embarrassing features, and to leave it, as its framers intended it
                            should be, a full and perfect settlement, for all time, of all possible
                            issues between the United States and Great Britain with regard to
                            Central America.”</p>
                        <p>The correspondence in question was laid before Parliament in 1860, and
                            the principal papers included in it have also been published in
                            Hertslet’s State Papers.<note n="*" xml:id="d205fn1">Vol. xl, p. 953;

                            quoted by Mr. Blaine will be necessary in order to appreciate the
                            character which Mr. Blaine has attributed to them.</p>
                        <p>In cases where the details of an international agreement have given rise
                            to difficulties and discussions to such an extent as to cause the

                            modification as one of several possible alternatives, and where it has
                            yet been found preferable to arrive at a solution as to those details
                            rather than to sacrifice the general basis of the engagement, it must
                            surely be allowed that such a fact, far from being an argument against
                            that engagement, is an argument distinctly in its favor. It is equally
                            plain that either of the contracting parties which had abandoned its own
                            contention for the purpose of preserving the agreement in its entirety
                            would have reason to complain if the differences which had been settled
                            by its concession were afterwards urged as a reason for essentially
                            modifying those other provisions which it had made this sacrifice to
                            maintain. That both these arguments apply in the present instance a
                            brief review of the correspondence will, I think, suffice to show.</p>
                        <p>The treaty of 1850 was concluded (as is declared in the VIIIth Article)
                            with the desire “not only to accomplish a particular object, but also to
                            establish a general principle,” in regard to the protection, by treaty
                            stipulations, of any practical communications, whether by canal or
                            railway, across the isthmus which connects North and South America.</p>

                        <p>Soon after the signature of the treaty various discussions arose as to
                            the interpretation to be put upon those clauses which debarred either of
                            the contracting parties from occupying, fortifying, or colonizing, or
                            assuming or exercising any dominion over Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the
                            Mosquito coast, or any part of Central America, &amp;c. Great Britain
                            being at the time in possession of Ruatan and other islands off the
                            coast of Honduras, and having a protectorate over the Mosquito Indians
                            located on the coast of Nicaragua, a lengthened correspondence arose as
                            to the effect to be given to the treaty in this respect, and also as to
                            the boundary of British Honduras. A treaty was eventually signed by Lord
                            Clarendon and Mr. Dallas, for the settlement of the various questions at
                            issue, on the 17th October, 1856; but this agreement was not received
                            with favor by the United States Senate, and the incoming government of
                            President Buchanan, who had acceded to office in March, 1857, declined
                            to confirm it without certain modifications. To these the British
                            Government proposed further amendments, which were not at that time
                            deemed acceptable by that of the United States, and the treaty was never
                            formally ratified.</p>
                        <p>To show how far this part of the discussion belonged in some of its
                            features to a state of affairs that is now past, one of the objections
                            taken by General Cass to the treaty in its last amended form was that it
                            involved a recognition by the United States of a treaty between Great
                            Britain and Honduras for the cession of the Bay Islands to the latter
                            country, in which it was stipulated that slavery should not at any time
                            be permitted to exist there. General Cass stated that “a treaty with
                            such a provision would never be recognized by a United States Senate.”

                        <p>I now proceed to examine some of the extracts given in Mr. Blaine’s

                                    abrogated all intervention on the part of England in the Central
                                    American territory. The British Government had put a different
                                    construction on the treaty, and he regretted the vote he had
                                    given in its favor.</p>

                                    relations of an ancient date; it was just, and consistent with
                                    the practice of the United States, that those Indians should be
                                    secured in the separate possession of lands, the sale of which
                                    should be prohibited, and in the enjoyment of rights and
                                    franchises, though in a condition of dependency and protection.
                                    The British Government had already removed one impediment to the
                                    execution of the Bulwer-Clayton treaty by the cession of their

                                    Britain and Nicaragua, in which the concessions and guarantees
                                    of the latter in favor of the Indians should be associated with

                        <p>The next quotation is from another dispatch of Lord Napier, dated the 6th
                            of May, 1857, and the passage given runs thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The President denounced the Clayton-Bulwer treaty as one which
                                    had been fraught with misunderstanding and mischief from the
                                    beginning; it was concluded under the most opposite
                                    constructions by the contracting parties. If the Senate had
                                    imagined that it could obtain the interpretation placed upon it
                                    by Great Britain, it would not have passed. If he had been in
                                    the Senate at the time, that treaty never would have been
                                    sanctioned.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>But President Buchanan went on to say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>With reference to arbitration (which Lord Napier had only thrown
                                    in as a suggestion of his own), he could not give any opinion at
                                    present. The President also inveighed against the excess of
                                    treaties, affirming that they were more frequently the cause of
                                    quarrel than of harmony, and that if it were not for the
                                    interoceanic communications, he did not see there was any
                                    necessity for a treaty respecting Central America at all.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It seems, therefore, that the President’s condemnation of the
                            Clayton-Bulwer treaty was principally founded on the construction placed
                            upon it by Great Britain at the time, and was also in some measure
                            explained by his objections to treaties in general, but that he admitted
                            that the question of the interoceanic connection made such an agreement
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blaine then quotes a note from Mr. Cass to Lord Napier, of the 29th
                            May, 1857, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Clayton-Bulwer treaty, concluded in the hope that it would
                                    put an end to the differences which had arisen between the
                                    United States and Great Britain concerning Central American
                                    affairs, had been rendered inoperative in some of its most
                                    essential provisions by the different constructions which had
                                    been reciprocally given to it by the parties. And little is
                                    hazarded in saying that, had the interpretation since put upon
                                    the treaty by the British Government, and yet maintained, been
                                    anticipated, it would not have been negotiated under the
                                    instructions of any Executive of the United States, nor ratified
                                    by the branch of the government intrusted with the power of
                                    ratification.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>But how does General Cass continue? He goes on to say: <quote

                                    failed to reconcile the conflicting views of the parties; and,
                                    as a last resort, a negotiation was opened for the purpose of
                                    forming a supplementary treaty which should remove, if
                                    practicable, the difficulties in the way of their mutual good
                                    understanding, and leave unnecessary any further discussion of
                                    the controverted provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. It was
                                    to effect this object that the Government of the United States
                                    agreed to open the negotiation which terminated in the treaty of

                                    of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, and, having failed to
                                    meet its approbation, has been returned unratified. The parties
                                    are thus thrown back upon the Bulwer-Clayton treaty, with its
                                    disputed phraseology and its conflicting interpretations; and
                                    after the lapse of seven years, not one of the objects connected
                                    with the political condition of Central America which the United
                                    States had hoped to obtain by the arrangement has been

                        <p>It was not, therefore, to the principles or basis of the arrangement (the
                            importance of which was fully recognized), but to the unfortunate
                            phraseology of a single portion of the treaty, that objection was

                        <p>Mr. Blaine then refers to Sir W. Gore Ouseley’s missions, the object of
                            which was to settle the points at issue in a manner practically
                            satisfactory to the United States by independent negotiations with the
                            Central American states, after first communicating with the government
                            at Washington. Mr. Blaine quotes a passage from a letter of General Cass
                            to Lord Napier, of the 20th October, 1857, as follows: <quote

                                <p>I have thus endeavored to meet the frank suggestions of your

                                    policy of the United States with respect to the governments and

                                    contemplating a “harmonious course of action and counsel between

                                    adjust between the United States and Great Britain still remain
                                    unsettled, while the treaty itself has become the subject of new
                                    and embarrassing complications.</p>

                        <p>It will be useful to refer to the previous portion of this note to show
                            what was the statement of the “general policy of the United States” thus
                            referred to, and how far that policy corresponds with Mr. Blaine’s
                            present proposals. The note begins thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have had the honor to receive your lordship’s communication of
                                    the 9th instant, in reference to the existing relations between
                                    Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and have submitted it to the
                                    consideration of the President.</p>
                                <p>These relations have attracted the earnest attention of the
                                    President, not only from the importance of the San Juan transit
                                    to the commerce of the world, but from the interest which is
                                    naturally felt by the United States in the neighboring republics
                                    of this continent. The President has witnessed, therefore, the
                                    restoration of peace to Nicaragua and Costa Rica with the
                                    highest gratification; and he sincerely hopes that it may not
                                    again be interrupted, either by the calamity of civil war or the
                                    invasion of their territory from other countries. Their security
                                    and welfare would undoubtedly be promoted by a just and friendly
                                    settlement between them of their mutual boundaries and
                                    jurisdiction; and I need hardly add that such an adjustment
                                    would be viewed with satisfaction by the United States. This
                                    government, however, has never admitted the pretensions of Costa
                                    Rica to an equal control with Nicaragua of the San Juan River,
                                    but has regarded the sovereignty of the river, and consequently
                                    of the interoceanic transit by that route, as rightly belonging
                                    to the republic of Nicaragua.</p>
                                <p>A similar view of the question appears to have been recognized by
                                    Great Britain; and, whatever may be the rights of Costa Rica
                                    with respect to the free passage of her own products by the
                                    river to the ocean, it is better, probably, that what has been
                                    thus acquiesced in, and has led, moreover, to important
                                    contracts and responsibilities, should not now be disturbed. But
                                    under any circumstances the commercial nations of the world can
                                    never permit the interoceanic passages of the isthmus to be
                                    rendered useless for all the great purposes which belong to them
                                    in consequence of the neglect or incapacity of the States
                                    through whose territories they happen to run. <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>And in a later note to Lord Napier, of the 8th November, 1858, General
                            Cass states with still greater clearness the object with which the
                            treaty was concluded, and the grounds on which the difference between
                            the two governments had arisen. He says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Since the announcement by your lordship, in October, 1857, of Sir
                                    William Ouseley’s special mission, the President has awaited not
                                    so much any new proposition for the adjustment of the Central
                                    American questions as the statement in detail, which he had been
                                    led to expect, of the method by which Sir William Ouseley was to
                                    carry into effect the previous proposition of the British
                                    Government. To make this plain, your lordship will pardon me for
                                    making a brief reference to what has occurred between the two
                                    governments in respect to Central America since the ratification
                                    of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850.</p>
                                <p>While the declared object of that convention had reference to the
                                    construction of a ship-canal, by the way of San Juan and the
                                    Lakes of Nicaragua and Managua, from the Atlantic to the Pacific
                                    Oceans, <hi rend="italic">yet it avowed none the less plainly a
                                        general principle in reference to all practicable
                                        communications across the isthmus, and laid down a distinct
                                        policy by which the practical operation of this principle
                                        was likely to be kept free from all embarrassment. The
                                        principle was that the interoceanic routes should remain
                                        under the sovereignty <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309"

                                        should he neutral and free to all nations alike. The policy
                                        was that, in order to prevent any government outside of
                                        those states from obtaining undue control or influence over
                                        those interoeeanic transits, no such nation should erect or
                                        maintain any fortifications commanding the same, or in the
                                        vicinity thereof, or should “occupy, or fortify, or
                                        colonize, or assume, or exercise any dominion over
                                        Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito coast, or any part of
                                        Central America.”</hi> So far as the United States and Great
                                    Britain were concerned, those stipulations were expressed in
                                    unmistakable terms; and in reference to other nations it was
                                    declared that the “contracting parties in this convention engage
                                    to invite every state with which both or either have friendly
                                    intercourse to enter into stipulations with them similar to
                                    those which they have entered into with each other.”</p>
                                <p>At that time the United States had no possessions whatever in
                                    Central America, and exercised no dominion there. In respect to
                                    this government, therefore, the provisions of Article I of the
                                    treaty could operate only as a restriction for the future; but
                                    Great Britain was in the actual exercise of dominion over nearly
                                    the whole eastern coast of that country, and in relation to her
                                    this article had a present as well as a prospective operation.
                                    She was to abandon the occupancy which she already had in
                                    Central America, and was neither to make acquisitions, or erect
                                    fortifications, or exercise dominion there in the future. In
                                    other words, she was to place herself in the same position with
                                    respect to possessions and dominion in Central America which was
                                    to be occupied by the United States and which both of the
                                    contracting parties to the treaty engaged that they would
                                    endeavor to induce other nations to occupy.</p>
                                <p>This was the treaty as it was understood and consented to by the
                                    United States, and this is the treaty as it is still understood
                                    by this government.</p>

                        <p>He then recapitulates the discussions and abortive negotiations which had
                            ensued in consequence of the different interpretations put upon the
                            treaty by the two governments; and, after criticising and expressing
                            disappointment at the last communication made to him by Lord Napier, he
                            concludes: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It is of no small consequence either to the United States or
                                    Great Britain that these Central American controversies between
                                    the two countries should be forever closed. On some points of
                                    them, and, I have been led to hope, on the general policy which
                                    ought to apply to the whole isthmian region, they have reached a
                                    common ground of agreement. The neutrality of the interoeeanic
                                    routes, and their freedom from the superior and controlling
                                    influence of any one government; the principles upon which the
                                    Mosquito protectorate maybe arranged, with justice alike to the
                                    sovereignty of Nicaragua and the Indian tribes; the surrender of
                                    the Bay Islands, under certain stipulations for the benefit of
                                    trade and the protection of their British occupants; and the
                                    definition of the boundaries of British Belize; about all these
                                    points there is no apparent disagreement, except as to the
                                    conditions which shall be annexed to the Bay Islands surrender
                                    and as to the limits which shall be fixed to the settlements of
                                    Belize. Is it possible that, if approached in a spirit of
                                    conciliation and good feeling, these two points of difference
                                    are not susceptible of a friendly adjustment? To believe this
                                    would be to underestimate the importance of the adjustment and
                                    the intelligent appreciation of this importance which must be
                                    entertained by both nations. What the United States want in
                                    Central America, next to the happiness of its people, is the
                                    security and neutrality of the interoceanic routes which lead
                                    through it. This is equally the desire of Great Britain, of
                                    France, and of the whole commercial world. If the principles and
                                    policy of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty are carried into effect,
                                    this object is accomplished. When, therefore, Lord Malmesbury
                                    invites new overtures from this government upon the idea that it
                                    has rejected the proposal embraced in Sir William Ouseley’s
                                    mission for an adjustment of the Central American questions by
                                    separate treaties with Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala, upon
                                    terms substantially according with the general tenor of the
                                    American interpretation of the treaty, I have to reply to his
                                    lordship that this very adjustment is all that the President has
                                    ever desired, and that, instead of having rejected that
                                    proposal, he had expressed his cordial acceptance of it, so far
                                    as he understood it, and had anticipated from it the most
                                    gratifying consequences.</p>

                        <p>Further, in a dispatch to Mr. Lamar of July 25, 1858, subsequently
                            communicated to Lord Malmesbury by Mr. Dallas on the 29th of April,
                            1859, General Cass says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>It is difficult to conceive a more distinct statement of adherence to the
                            general principles of the Clayton-Bulwer arrangement or a more positive
                            disclaimer of the policy involved in Mr. Blaine’s present proposals than
                            is contained in the passages I have just quoted.</p>
                        <p>I return, however, to the extracts given in Mr. Blaine’s dispatch. Mr.
                            Blaine alludes to an important interview which Lord Napier had with
                            President Buchanan on the 19th October, 1857, in which Lord Napier asked
                            that pending the negotiation intrusted to Sir W. Gore Ouseley no
                            proposal to annul the Clayton-Bulwer treaty should be sanctioned or
                            encouraged by the President or members of the United States Government.
                            Lord Napier’s account of the President’s language is as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The President commenced his observations by referring to the
                                    Clayton-Bulwer treaty as a fruitful source of misunderstanding
                                    between the contracting parties. Without that treaty the United
                                    States and Great Britain might long since have co-operated for
                                    the welfare of Central America. That treaty had never been
                                    acceptable to the people of the United States, and would not
                                    have obtained a vote in the Senate had the least suspicion
                                    existed of the sense in which it was to be construed by Great
                                    Britain; yet, if it were now the intention of Her Majesty’s
                                    Government to execute it according to the American
                                    interpretation, that was as much as we could insist upon.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>And after reporting what passed at the interview with regard to the Bay
                            Islands and Honduras, Lord Napier continued: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I then went on to animadvert upon the danger of some movement in
                                    the approaching Congress which would interfere with the
                                    contemporary negotiation of Sir William Ouseley, remarking that
                                    should the President, in his message, allude to the position of
                                    the two countries in reference to Central America, and if, in
                                    consequence of his Excellency’s reflections, a resolution should
                                    be proposed for the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty,
                                    such a step would not only frustrate the purposes of Sir William
                                    Ouseley’s mission, but would have a calamitous influence on the
                                    future relations of England and America. It would, therefore, be
                                    highly gratifying to me to be enabled to assure your lordship
                                    that pending the negotiation intrusted to Sir William Ouseley no
                                    proposal to annul the treaty would be sanctioned or encouraged
                                    by his Excellency or by the members of his government.</p>
                                <p>The President stated, in reply, that it was certainly his
                                    intention to give an account in his message of all that had
                                    passed between the two governments respecting the
                                    Dallas-Clarendon treaty. He appeared to intimate that the effect
                                    of such a narrative would be to place the conduct of Great
                                    Britain in an unfavorable light, and he added that the passage
                                    in which he commented upon these transactions was already
                                    prepared; but his Excellency went on to affirm, with emphasis,
                                    that if the resolutions of her Majesty’s Government were such as
                                    I had related, if they really meant to execute the
                                    Clayton-Bulwer treaty according to the American interpretation,
                                    and would, before the meeting of Congress, make some
                                    communication to him in that sense, such as he could use, he
                                    would cancel what he had written and insert another passage
                                    referring to the mission of Sir William Ouseley, and that
                                    “nothing would give him greater pleasure than to add the
                                    expression of his sincere and ardent wish for the maintenance of
                                    friendly relations between the two countries.”</p>
                                <p>His Excellency also distinctly declared that, under the
                                    circumstances here described, no attempt against the
                                    Clayton-Bulwer treaty in Congress would have any countenance
                                    from him whatever. To him it was indifferent whether the
                                    concession contemplated by Her Majesty’s Government were
                                    consigned to a direct engagement between England and the United
                                    States, or to treaties between the former and the Central
                                    American republics; the latter method might, in some respects,
                                    be even more agreeable to him, and he thought it would be more
                                    convenient to Her Majesty’s Government, who might, with greater
                                    facility, accede to the claims of the weaker party.</p>

                        <p>I pass over some passages given in Mr. Blaine’s dispatch which seem to
                            call for no remark, and I would only observe that the proposal for
                            arbitration alluded to in Lord Napier’s note to General Cass of February
                            17, 1858, applied only to the controverted points in the treaty, and not
                            to the whole instrument.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blaine refers to a conversation with General Cass, reported by Lord
                            Napier in a dispatch of the 22d March, 1858, in which reference was made
                            to the idea of an abrogation of the treaty. It may be well to <pb
                                n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0383"/>give a larger extract of this
                            dispatch, because, although Lord Napier’s remarks were stated to be
                            personal and unofficial, they show his view of the form which such an
                            abrogation should take. He says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have, accordingly, on two occasions, informed General Cass
                                    that, if the Government of the United States he still of the
                                    same mind, and continue to desire the abrogation of the treaty
                                    of 1850, it would be agreeable to Her Majesty’s Government that
                                    they should insert proposal to that effect in their reply to my
                                    note respecting arbitration, and to that in which I explained
                                    the character and motives of the mission intrusted to Her
                                    Majesty’s commissioner in Central America.</p>
                                <p>Some conversation ensued regarding the manner in which the
                                    dissolution of the treaty should be effected, and the condition
                                    by which it might be accompanied, and on these topics I have
                                    held the following language, premising that the views expressed
                                    were altogether spontaneous and personal, for I had no
                                    information of the intentions of Her Majesty’s Government beyond
                                    the bare fact that they would entertain a proposal to cancel the
                                    engagements of 1850 emanating from the United States.</p>
                                <p>I stated that, in my opinion, the treaty in question could only
                                    be repealed by a new treaty in the usual forms, and that it
                                    might be desirable that such a treaty should not be restricted
                                    to a single article annulling its predecessor. Both for
                                    considerations of decency and policy I advocated the insertion
                                    of stipulations involving an expression of a common policy in
                                    Central America, and the disavowal of any exclusive or
                                    monopolizing projects on either side. I said that I thought a
                                    treaty might be framed of three articles.</p>
                                <p>The first should declare the desire of the contracting parties to
                                    encourage and protect the organization of transit routes in the
                                    interoceanic region, and bind those parties never to negotiate
                                    for any rights or privileges of transit with the Central
                                    American states of a preferential or exclusive character, to
                                    which other nations might not, by negotiation, be equally
                                    admitted, establishing thus the principle of an equal enjoyment
                                    of those avenues of trade for all the countries of the
                                    world.</p>
                                <p>The second article might recognize the jurisdiction of the
                                    transit route by the San Juan River as being vested in the
                                    Government of Nicaragua. This had been already avowed by the
                                    United States in a treaty negotiated with that republic. It had
                                    not been definitely affirmed by Great Britain, and might seem to
                                    clash with the claims of the King of Mosquitia to territorial
                                    possession or authority in those parts. I thought, however, that
                                    in regard to the views lately expressed by Her Majesty’s
                                    Government in the course of recent negotiations, in
                                    consideration of the necessity of obtaining a suitable treaty
                                    with Nicaragua, and for the purpose of placing themselves in
                                    harmony with the course pursued by the United States, Her
                                    Majesty’s Government might, on this head, accede to an article
                                    which would practically restrict their protectorate in
                                    Mosquitia, and prevent the imputation of any interference on
                                    their part with the territory traversed by the river, and,
                                    therefore, by the transit route.</p>
                                <p>Finally, I suggested that Article III of the treaty should simply
                                    declare the provisions of the treaty of 1850 to be void and of
                                    no effect. I added that the question of future territorial
                                    acquisition in Central America would thus be thrown open to the
                                    United States; that Her Majesty’s Government, on the other hand,
                                    would retain the colony of Honduras in the proportions which
                                    might be given to it by treaty arrangements with Guatemala, and
                                    that the Bay Islands would remain attached to the British Crown.
                                    Indeed, I affirmed, still as a personal opinion, but of the most
                                    positive character, that in case of the dissolution of the
                                    Clayton-Bulwer treaty, the Bay Islands would not be relinquished
                                    by Her Majesty’s Government. I felt bound to make this
                                    statement, having observed in some quarters an impression that
                                    Her Majesty’s Government might be disposed not only to annul the
                                    treaty, thus opening a path for the eventual annexation of the
                                    isthmus to the Federal Union, but to give up the Bay Islands as
                                    well; a notion altogether unfounded in any intimation which has
                                    hitherto reached me from the foreign office, and which could not
                                    be reconciled, in my opinion, to the interests of England.</p>

                        <p>Lord Napier adds that he was most careful to remark throughout that the
                            opinions he enunciated with reference to the treaty were exclusively his
                            own.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Blaine gives only a very short extract from Lord Malmesbury’s
                            dispatch in reply of the 8th April, 1858. It will be desirable to quote
                            it more at length. Lord Malmesbury says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Her Majesty’s Government, if the initiative is still left to them
                                    by the unwillingness of the United States themselves to propose
                                    abrogation, desire to retain full liberty as to the manner and
                                    form in which any such proposal shall be laid on their behalf
                                    before the Cabinet at Washington; but without pronouncing any
                                    decided opinion at the present moment, I think it right to point
                                    out to your lordship that the effect of <pb n="312"
                                        xml:id="pg_312" facs="0384"/>such an article as that
                                    suggested in your dispatch, as the second, might be to
                                    perpetuate an entanglement with the Government of the United
                                    States, and to place that government in a position to question
                                    or control the free action of Her Majesty’s Government in
                                    everything that relates to Central America. The Clayton-Bulwer
                                    treaty has been a source of unceasing embarrassment to this
                                    country, and Her Majesty’s Government, if they should be so
                                    fortunate as to extricate themselves from the difficulties which
                                    have resulted from it, will not involve themselves, directly or
                                    indirectly, in any similar difficulties for the future.</p>
                                <p>Her Majesty’s Government would have no objection to enter with
                                    the United States into a self-denying engagement such as that
                                    suggested in your first article, by which both parties should
                                    renounce all exclusive advantage in the use of any of the
                                    interoceanic routes, and should bind themselves, each to the
                                    other, not to interfere with free transit. Such an article would
                                    he a suitable substitute for the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, for it
                                    would secure, as regards the contracting parties, the avowed
                                    object of that treaty—the freedom of interoceanic
                                    communication.</p>
                                <p>But beyond this Her Majesty’s Government, as at present advised,
                                    are not prepared to contract any engagement as a substitute for
                                    the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and from the abrogation of that
                                    compact, if it should take place, they will hold themselves as
                                    free to act in regard to Central America in the manner most
                                    conducive to the advancement of British interests and the
                                    fulfillment of British obligations as if the treaty had never
                                    been concluded.</p>
                                <p>Your lordship was, therefore, perfectly right in using decided
                                    language such as that reported in your dispatch respecting the
                                    Bay Islands; and whenever the subject of the abrogation of the
                                    Clayton-Bulwer treaty is mooted in your presence, you will make
                                    it perfectly clear to the Government of the United States that
                                    to abrogate the treaty is to return to the <hi rend="italic"
                                        >status quo ante</hi> its conclusion in 1850; that Her
                                    Majesty’s Government have no kind of jealousy respecting
                                    American colonization in Central America, which, indeed, it
                                    would help to civilize; and that we neither ask nor wish for any
                                    exclusive privileges whatever in those regions.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>These, then, were the terms upon which Her Majesty’s Government were
                            alone prepared, if at, all, to consider the abrogation of the
                            Clayton-Bulwer treaty. And such an alternative was deprecated by General
                            Cass in a note to Lord Napier of the 6th April, 1858, in which, while
                            declining the proposal of arbitration on the disputed points of the
                            treaty, he alluded to a personal expression of opinion he had given in
                            favor of an unconditional renunciation of the treaty, and called
                            attention to the serious consequences which might result from its
                            dissolution, if no provision were made at the same time for adjusting
                            the questions which led to it. He then concluded with the passage quoted
                            by Mr. Blaine, to the effect that “if the President does not hasten to
                            consider now the alternative of repealing the treaty of 1850, it is
                            because he does not wish prematurely to anticipate the failure of Sir
                            William Ouseley’s mission, and is disposed to give a new proof to Her
                            Majesty’s Government of his sincere desire to preserve the amicable
                            relations which now happily subsist between the two countries.”</p>
                        <p>But subsequent events make it unnecessary to dwell further upon this part
                            of the discussion, for the question was settled by the practical
                            accomplishment of that which the United States Government regarded as
                            the most satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                        <p>It is here that the extracts and account of the negotiation given by Mr.
                            Blaine come to an end at a point when the most important episode
                            commences. The continuation of the correspondence shows that on the 30th
                            April, 1859, a treaty was concluded between Great Britain and Guatemala
                            for the settlement of the question of the boundary of Belize; that on
                            the 28th November, 1859, another treaty was concluded between this
                            country and Honduras for the transfer of the Bay Islands to that
                            republic, as well as for the settlement of other questions relating to
                            the Mosquito Indians and the claims of British subjects, including the
                            withdrawal of the British protectorate, and that on the 28th January,
                            1860, a third treaty was concluded between this country and Nicaragua,
                            also with reference to the Mosquito Indians and the claims of British
                            subjects.</p>
                        <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0385"/>
                        <p>Copies of these three treaties were officially communicated to the United
                            States Government, with the expression of a hope on the part, of Her
                            Majesty’s Government that they would “finally set at rest the questions
                            respecting the interpretation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty which had
                            been the subject of so much controversy between this country and the
                            United States.”</p>
                        <p>And in his message to Congress of the 3d December, 1860, President
                            Buchanan says the dangerous questions arising from the Bulwer-Clayton
                            treaty “have been amicably and honorably adjusted. The discordant
                            constructions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty between the two governments,
                            which at different periods of the discussion bore a threatening aspect,
                            have resulted <hi rend="italic">in a final settlement entirely
                                satisfactory to this government.”</hi></p>
                        <p>I have been forced to give the above extracts at considerable length, and
                            I refrain from adding other passages which would tend to illustrate and
                            confirm them. A persual of them, however, will, I think, suffice to

                                    in regard to the treaty, and which occasioned at one time
                                    considerable irritation, but which have long since been happily

                                    across the isthmus, but had their origin in a stipulation which
                                    Mr. Blaine still proposes in a great part to maintain. He wishes
                                    every part of the treaty in which Great Britain and the United
                                    States agree to make no acquisition of territory in Central
                                    America to remain in full force, while he desires to cancel
                                    those portions of the treaty which forbid the United States
                                    fortifying the canal, and holding the political control of it in
                                    conjunction with the country in which it is located.</item>

                                <item>That the declarations of the United States Government during
                                    the controversy were distinctly at variance with any such
                                    proposal as that just stated. They disclaimed any desire to
                                    obtain an exclusive or preferential control over the canal.
                                    Their sole contention was, that Great Britain was bound by the
                                    treaty to abandon those positions on the mainland or adjacent
                                    islands, which, in their opinion, were calculated to give her
                                    the means of such a control. Nor did they in any way seek to
                                    limit the application of the principles laid down in the treaty
                                    so as to exclude Colombian or Mexican territory, as Mr. Blaine
                                    now suggests, nor urge that such application would be
                                    inconsistent with the convention between the United States and
                                    New Granada of 1846. On the contrary, they were ready to give
                                    those principles their full extension.</item>

                                    condition of reverting to the <hi rend="italic">status quo

                                    justly pointed out, it would have been fraught with great danger
                                    to the good relations between the two countries—but which is now
                                    rendered impossible by the subsequent events.</item>

                        <p>Referring to the previous correspondence of this Department with your
                            legation in reference to Indian incursions across the northwestern
                            boundary line between this country and the Dominion of Canada, I now
                            have the honor to inform you that, upon full consideration of the
                            subject, this government has decided to instruct its military
                            authorities near the boundary in question, to compel by force if
                            necessary all our Indians to remain on this side of the line, with the
                            expectation that the Dominion authorities will do the same with their
                            dependent tribes.</p>
                        <p>To this end the military authorities on that border will be instructed to
                            maintain the most friendly relations with the Dominion police force, and
                            to give them prompt notice of any movement of any of the bands of
                            Indians likely to cause trouble, expecting reciprocal information from
                            the Dominion forces.</p>

                                there is no United States representative, to continue in the
                                enjoyment of such advantages as they obtained from the presence of a
                                British consular officer previous to the issue of my circular of the
                                20th of August last. I am now requested by Earl Granville to inform
                                you that although by the circular in question you were instructed to
                                discourage as much as possible the granting of British protection to
                                persons who were not British subjects you may still continue to
                                extend your good offices in favor of foreign missionaries or any
                                religious community who may solicit them in cases of unmerited
                                violence and oppression by the local authorities, provided that no
                                inconvenience has hitherto arisen from such action, and provided
                                that your protection is not carried further than if the case were
                                that of a British subject. You are accordingly authorized to

                                citizens as you were in the habit of giving previous to the issue of

                        <p>The situation along the northwestern frontier has of late assumed such an
                            aspect as to constrain me to again urge through your legation upon the
                            British authorities the need of a distinct and prompt understanding in
                            the premises.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of War reports to me that some twelve hundred British
                            Indians are on the American side of the frontier, along Rock Creek and
                            Milk River, in the reservation of the Fort Peck Agency, in Montana
                            Territory, and are robbing the American Indians of their winter supplies
                            of meat, besides affording a rendezvous for illicit traffic across the
                            frontier. In view of these depredations and the intolerable state of
                            things thereby occasioned, the general commanding in the Northwest
                            recommends urgently that the camps of the intruding Indians be broken up
                            and their occupants driven across the line. This recommendation is
                            concurred in by the Secretary of the Interior and by the Commissioner of
                            Indian Affairs.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th ultimo I had the honor to inform you that the authorities of
                            the United States would be instructed to compel all our Indians to
                            remain on this side of the line, with the expectation that the Dominion
                            authorities would do the same with their independent tribes, and I added
                            that, to assist in encompassing this end, the United States forces on
                            the border would be directed to give to the Dominion police prompt
                            notice of any movements of Indians which might seem likely to occasion
                            trouble, and that reciprocal information would be expected from the
                            Dominion authorities. I am as yet without any intimation that the
                            reciprocal course thus proposed is acceptable to the Dominion Government
                            or that it is prepared to respond to the action which our own forces
                            have been ordered to take in the interest of the mutual preservation of
                            peace along the border.</p>
                        <p>The presence of so large a body of alien Indians depredating on the
                            reservations of our own Indians seems, however, to render necessary some
                            more immediately active remedy, and I am constrained to recommend to the
                            President that the suggestion of General Terry be adopted, and that the
                            military authorities of the United States in Montana be instructed to
                            remove the intruding Indians by force, breaking up their camps and
                            sending them across the frontier. Before taking such a <pb n="316"
                                xml:id="pg_316" facs="0388"/>course, which necessarily involves the
                            destruction of what belongs to the intruders and the use of force to
                            tribes not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it seems
                            but proper that I should bring the matter to your attention in order to
                            learn whether the Dominion authorities are prepared for their part to
                            receive and maintain their own Indians and to use such measures of
                            police surveillance, and force, if need be, to prevent their again
                            marauding upon the territory of the United States, or, if their forays
                            cannot be prevented, then to give to our military forces on the frontier
                            such information of the actual or apprehended movements of the Dominion
                            Indians as may enable them to be successfully repelled by our own
                            authorities should they again seek to cross the border.</p>
                        <p>I confess that I am reluctant to counsel the President to adopt a measure
                            which would have the appearance of a harsh use of force toward alien
                            tribes, but in the absence of a practical system of co-operation whereby
                            the forces on either side of the line may effectively maintain their
                            respective Indians and restrain their predatory forays, I do not see any
                            remedy for these destructive raids but the removal of the intruders from
                            the territory of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your note of the 29th
                            ultimo, and to previous correspondence, respecting the incursions of
                            Indians on the northwest frontier, I have the honor to inform you that I
                            have received a telegram from the Marquis of Lorne, stating that Canada
                            will endeavor to prevent her Indians from crossing the border and
                            expects the United States Government to do likewise; that every
                            information will be given to the United States authorities of Indian
                            movements, and that the police force of the Dominion of Canada will
                            afford all assistance.</p>
                        <p>I have now the honor to call your attention to the report of the Privy
                            Council of Canada forwarded to the State Department in a note from this
                            legation, dated September 26, 1881, from which report you will perceive
                            that the Dominion Government gladly assents to restrain Indians of
                            either country from crossing the frontier, and to this end refers to the
                            course pointed out in the minute of council of the 3d of June last, copy
                            of which was forwarded to your Department in a note under date of the
                            6th of that month, namely, that concerted action should be had between
                            the two governments. The report of the 16th of September goes on to say
                            that no answer to this suggestion has been received from the United
                            States Government, and that the Canadian Government will most willingly
                            consider any plan which may be suggested to them. I have further the
                            honor to remark to you with reference to the concluding paragraph of
                            your above mentioned note of the 29th ultimo, that the Government of the
                            Dominion can scarcely be now held responsible for the absence of a
                            practical system of co-operation whereby the forces on either side of
                            the line may effectively maintain their respective Indians and restrain

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my dispatch No. 86, of
                            the 31st ultimo, I have now to inform you that Her Majesty’s Government
                            have carefully considered the representations that have been made to
                            them by Mr. Lowell, on the part of the Government of the United States,
                            concerning the arrest and imprisonment of certain American citizens in
                            Ireland, and the hope expressed by the President that the American
                            citizens so detained may be brought to an early trial.</p>
                        <p>The persons at present detained in prison in Ireland under the provisions
                            of the protection of person and property act of 1881 have been, and are,
                            all of them, either ordinarily resident in Ireland or persons who have
                            visited Ireland under the present circumstances of that country, and to
                            whom full knowledge of those circumstances, and of the laws passed in
                            the last session of Parliament to arm the government there with
                            extraordinary powers, must be imputed.</p>
                        <p>In the use of these extraordinary powers, for the purpose of preventing
                            incentives to outrage and crime, and breaches of public order in
                            Ireland, no general distinction can be made between those persons, for
                            the time being in Ireland, who may have come there from the United
                            States or any other foreign countries in which they may have rights of
                            citizenship, and others; nor have Her Majesty’s Government generally any
                            means of knowing whether such persons are native Irishmen who have not
                            renounced their British nationality, or Irish emigrants who may have
                            obtained rights of citizenship in the United States or elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The statute of last session under which these prisoners are detained was
                            passed (like all other acts for the suspension of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >habeas corpus</hi>, whether in England or in the United States)
                            under circumstances of exceptional political necessity, for the express
                            purpose of superseding and dispensing with trial; and the reference, in
                            the first clause of the act, to the authority of the lord lieutenant of
                            Ireland was not for the purpose of enabling him to direct a trial (which
                            could only take place upon a charge regularly made in the ordinary
                            course of law), but for the contrary purpose.</p>
                        <p>The British legislature, in passing that act, declared the necessity of
                            such a suspension of trial under certain circumstances. This necessity
                            applies, within those conditions, alike to aliens and to British
                            subjects in Ireland; and Her Majesty’s Government are compelled to
                            consider that the necessity which led to the passing of the act still
                            subsists.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible either for Her Majesty’s Government or for the
                            Government of the United States to be ignorant that the present
                            disorders in Ireland have been, and are still, to a great extent
                            fomented by Irish emigrants in the United States, and by subscriptions
                            of money and publications hostile to British rule proceeding from that
                            source. As you are aware, Her Majesty’s Government found it necessary
                            last year to address a friendly representation on this subject to the
                            Government of the United States, and Her Majesty’s Government cannot
                            doubt that the President and his ministers must be desirous of
                            discouraging all such proceedings to the best of their power. Under such
                            circumstances, it is obvious that the efforts of Her Majesty’s
                            Government and of the British Parliament for the vindication of law and
                            the restoration of order in Ireland would be liable to be frustrated if
                            aliens in Ireland <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0390"/>(whatsoever
                            nationality they might claim) were in any respect treated as exempt from
                            the operation of laws which Parliament has found it necessary to enact
                            for that purpose, or from the extraordinary powers conferred upon the
                            executive government of Ireland by those laws.</p>
                        <p>The principle that in such cases no distinction can be made in favor of
                            aliens was maintained by the Government of the United States on the
                            suspension of the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> act in the
                            Northern States during the civil war. On that occasion, complaints
                            having been made of arbitrary and illegal arrests of certain British
                            subjects, Mr. Seward, in a note dated the 14th October, 1861, to Lord
                            Lyons, then Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, after vindicating the
                            legality of the proceedings complained of, expressed himself as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In every case subjects of Her Majesty residing in the United
                                    States, and under their protection, are treated during the
                                    present troubles in the same manner, and with no greater or less
                                    rigor, than American citizens.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Subsequently, in 1866, when the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> act
                            was suspended in Ireland, a correspondence took place between the two
                            governments as to the right of Irish-born naturalized citizens of
                            America then sojourning in Ireland to American protection. That
                            particular question has since been disposed of by the naturalization
                            act, 1870, whereby British subjects becoming voluntarily naturalized in
                            a foreign state forfeit their British nationality. But the following
                            extract from a dispatch, dated the 10th March, 1866, addressed by Mr.
                            Seward to Mr. Adams, then minister of the United States in London, and
                            published in the diplomatic correspondence presented to Congress with
                            the President’s message for that year, deserves particular notice, as
                            the instructions to the United States minister, which it contains,
                            entirely accord with the views of Her Majesty’s Government in relation
                            to the treatment of American citizens during the present troubles in
                            Ireland.</p>
                        <p>In those instructions Mr. Seward used the following language: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>It may be expected that some of our Irish-born naturalized
                                    citizens who are now sojourning or traveling in Ireland will be
                                    arrested upon complaints of complicity in seditious proceedings.
                                    It may also be expected that some who will be thus accused will
                                    be innocent, while others will be guilty. The situation will,
                                    for a time, necessarily become inconvenient and embarrassing. I
                                    know of no way in which you can meet it more properly than by
                                    pursuing the course which you have indicated.</p>
                                <p>Americans, whether native-born or naturalized, owe submission to
                                    the same laws in Great Britain as British subjects while
                                    residing there and enjoying the protection of that government.
                                    We applied the converse of this principle to British subjects
                                    who were sojourning or traveling in the United States during the
                                    late rebellion.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In a further dispatch, dated the 9th June, 1866, Mr. Seward instructed
                            Mr. Adams: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>To suggest to Lord Clarendon the expediency of the exercise of
                                    clemency to the extent at least of releasing all of the American
                                    citizens, native or naturalized, who are in confinement, upon
                                    the condition of their returning to the United States.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As no difference of opinion would appear to exist with respect to the
                            principle so clearly enunciated in the extracts above cited, Her
                            Majesty’s Government are in some doubt as to whether they have correctly
                            apprehended the grounds on which the Government of the United States
                            found their present representations in favor of those American citizens
                            in Ireland who have brought themselves under the operation of the
                            protection of person and property act, and it is unnecessary to pursue
                            the subject further at present.</p>
                        <p>I only desire to add that the imprisonment of suspects under the act is
                            not a measure of punishment, but of prevention. The Irish Government
                            have in many instances released prisoners upon a reasonable belief that
                            it could be done without risk to the public safety, and I need <pb
                                n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0391"/>hardly say that Her Majesty’s
                            Government are not desirous of detaining unnecessarily in prison any
                            persons from whom no danger to the public peace is to be
                            apprehended.</p>
                        <p>They will therefore be prepared to consider the circumstances of any
                            citizens of the United States now detained who may be willing to engage
                            forthwith to leave the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>I have to instruct you to read this dispatch to Mr. Frelinghuysen, and to
                            leave a copy of it with him if he should so desire.</p>

                            instant, relative to the reciprocal treatment of the migratory frontier
                            Indians by the United States and Canadian authorities. Copies of it have
                            been sent to the Secretaries of War and the Interior for their
                            information and the suggestion of any plan of concurrent operations on
                            the border which they may deem proper to be submitted to the Canadian
                            Government with a view to the adoption by them of analogous or
                            responsive plans. From the good disposition which your note shows, I
                            trust that we may be soon able to come to a complete and satisfactory
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I await with interest the reply to my suggestion of the 29th
                            ultimo that the military authorities on the frontier be immediately
                            ordered to break up the camps of the intruders and conduct them to the
                            border. If the Canadian Government is prepared to receive and maintain
                            so large a body of its own Indians the order will be given at once. I
                            have to request that you will use the telegraph to aid in speedy
                            conclusion.</p>

                        <p>Referring to our recent correspondence, touching the condition of affairs
                            in the Indian country near the Canadian frontier, I have the honor to
                            inform you that my colleague, the Secretary of War, has just learned
                            that, in consequence of the movements of the United States military
                            forces, the Canadian half-breeds and Crees have recrossed the line into
                            Canadian territory. Besides escorting a number of lodges of American
                            Indians back to their own reservations, the troops had sent a large body
                            of British Indians across the frontier and burned their lodges.</p>

                            upon the subject of the alleged forays of British Indians on American
                            territory, I have the honor to transmit to you herewith a copy of an
                            approved minute of the Privy Council of Canada embodying a report by the
                            Right Honorable Sir J. A. Macdonald, premier of the Dominion, to which
                            is appended a report by Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney, Indian Commissioner
                            for the northwest territories, on the subject.</p>
                        <p>In transmitting this document I would beg to call your attention to the
                            proposed system of “permits,” which is submitted to the consideration of

                                    Canada, approved by the Governor-General on the 24th day of
                                    April</hi>, 1882.</head>
                            <p>The committee of Council have had under consideration a dispatch,
                                dated March 31, 1882, from Her Majesty’s minister at Washington, Mr.
                                Sackville West, inclosing communications from Mr. Frelinghuysen, the
                                Secretary of State for the United States, together with a memorandum
                                from his excellency the Governor-General upon this dispatch,
                                adverting to previous correspondence on the subject of alleged
                                incursions of British Indians into United States territory.</p>
                            <p>The Right Hon. Sir John Macdonald, the first minister, to whom the
                                said dispatch with inclosures and his excellency’s memorandum were
                                referred, reports that, previous to the transfer to Canada of the
                                Northwest Territories by the Hudson’s Bay Company, the Indians of
                                that country on both sides of the line were allowed to roam at will
                                in pursuit of buffalo. In fact, the international boundary might be
                                considered unknown to the aborigines. Indians of the same tribe,
                                race, and lineage lived on both sides of the line, and were as one
                                people.</p>
                            <p>That since the acquisition of the country by Canada every exertion
                                has been made by the Canadian Government to induce the British
                                Indians to abandon their nomadic habits, and settle down on
                                reservations provided for them.</p>
                            <p>That considerable success has attended those efforts in the most
                                northerly portion of the Canadian territories, but it has been
                                impossible to attain any marked progress with the Indians near the
                                international boundary, owing to the presence in Canadian territory,
                                until recently, of several thousand United States Indians.</p>
                            <p>That those Indians having now returned to the United States, your
                                excellency is aware that the policy of urgently pressing our Indians
                                to leave the frontier and settle on reserves provided for them, well
                                in the interior, is being pursued with increased vigor, and with
                                good hopes of success. It cannot, however, be expected that the
                                Indians will be induced, by the efforts of one season, to abandon
                                altogether what they consider their traditional rights.</p>
                            <p>That in the cases of the Blackfeet and Assiniboine tribes, allied by
                                blood to each other, who are settled by treaty, both by the United
                                States and Canadian Governments, near to each other, it is not
                                reasonable to demand that these people should not visit each other;
                                but regulations may be introduced to allow this, while any proved
                                depredation committed by Individuals may be punished.</p>
                            <p>That it is believed that no military force, however strong, will
                                prevent occasional raids from either side, as is shown by repeated
                                horse and cattle stealing expeditions from the United States to
                                Canadian territory.</p>
                            <p>That the suggestion made by your excellency that individual permits
                                be granted by the authorities of both nations to their respective
                                Indians who may wish to cross the border for the purposes of hunting
                                and visiting relations, would, if adopted, place in the hands of the
                                officials of the two countries the means of satisfying all
                                reasonable demands of Indians of the various tribes who have
                                intermarried or may desire to hunt together. A short personal
                                description on the permit of the Indian bearing it would prevent a
                                transfer of it to any Indian haying no right to carry the
                                permit.</p>
                            <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0393"/>
                            <p>That should the United States Government concur in your excellency’s
                                suggestion, he, Sir John Macdonald, recommends the adoption of a
                                form of permit, and instruction as to the issues of the same, which
                                will be applicable to the officials of either country, and insure
                                uniformity of action by them. On this subject a report from the
                                honorable E. Dewdney, lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner of
                                the Northwest Territories, is hereto annexed. Neither government
                                should be held responsible for any wrongful act of an Indian holding
                                a permit, but he should be held personally responsible, and be as
                                severely punished as the law will allow, and forfeit forever
                                afterwards all claim to a renewal of his permit.</p>
                            <p>That in submitting the above for your excellency’s approval, he, the
                                first minister, states that it is the earnest wish of the Canadian
                                Government to prevent depredations by Canadian Indians on United
                                States territory, and at the same time to express their appreciation
                                of the friendly desire of the Government of the United States to act
                                in regard to their Indians for the same end, and it is confidently
                                hoped that a thorough understanding between the officers on either
                                side will facilitate the adoption of an arrangement which will
                                regulate what cannot be prevented, viz, the occasional movement of
                                Indians across the line.</p>
                            <p>Your excellency’s telegraphic dispatch to Her Majesty’s minister, of
                                the 4th of April instant, fully expresses the intention of the
                                Dominion Government to aid in the prevention of incursions and to
                                give every information as to the southward movements of our
                                Indians.</p>
                            <p>Sir John Macdonald suggests that some arrangement should be made
                                between Her Majesty’s Government and the United States Government by
                                which Indians on either side should, on complaint under oath
                                charging them with felonies or serious outrages against property, be
                                arrested and surrendered for trial in the country where the offenses
                                may have been committed, notwithstanding that such offenses may not
                                come within the terms of existing extradition treaties. This can, of
                                course, only be done by negotiations between the two governments, as
                                Canada has no power to act in the matter.</p>
                            <p>Sir John Macdonald further suggests that the Government of the United
                                States should be informed that by the statute of Canada, 32, 33
                                Victoria, cap. 21, section 112, there is the following
                                provision:</p>
                            <p>“If any person brings into Canada, or has in his possession therein
                                any property stolen, embezzled, converted or obtained by fraud or
                                false pretenses in any other country in such manner that the
                                stealing, embezzling, converting, or obtaining it in like manner in
                                Canada would by the laws of Canada be a felony or a misdemeanor,
                                then the bringing such property into Canada or the having it in
                                possession therein, knowing it to have been so stolen, embezzled, or
                                converted or unlawfully obtained, shall be an offense of the same
                                nature and punishable in like manner as if the stealing, embezzling,
                                converting, or unlawfully obtaining such property had taken place in
                                Canada, and such a person may be tried and convicted in any district
                                or place in Canada into or in which he brings such property or has
                                it in possession.”</p>
                            <p>That under this clause any Indian stealing cattle or other property
                                in the United States can be tried for the offense as if the crime
                                had taken place within the Dominion of Canada. If a similar law
                                obtains in the United States territories, the enforcement of its
                                provisions would seem to afford an efficient check on the system of
                                raids prevailing along the border.</p>
                            <p>The committee concur in the report of the right honorable the first
                                minister, and advise that a copy of this minute, when approved, be
                                transmitted to Her Majesty’s minister at Washington.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have considered the dispatch and the
                                accompanying papers forwarded to me in your letter of the 20th of
                                March, No. 28748, relative to the incursion of Canadian Indians into
                                the United States and American Indians into Canadian territory.</p>

                                the boundary in anything like the number they have hitherto done,
                                and had not the American traders on the Missouri River held out
                                inducements to our chiefs to come south, very few could have done so
                                this winter.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion made by his excellency the Governor-General to grant
                                permits to Indians who wish to cross the border would, I think,
                                answer well in treaty No. 7.</p>
                            <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0394"/>
                            <p>Previous to the establishing of the international boundary, the
                                Piegan, Blood, and Blackfeet Indians occupied the country of
                                Northwestern Montana in United States territory and Fort McLeod in
                                Canadian territory.</p>
                            <p>The Indians living north and south of the boundary are intermarried
                                and are continually visiting each other. It would be considered a
                                great hardship were we to forbid them continuing their visits.</p>
                            <p>It has come to my knowledge that the south Piegans have invited our
                                Indians to join them in the hunt, both in the fall of 1881 and 1882,
                                and as the United States Piegans obtain permission from the Indian
                                agent to leave their reserves, I should not think the American
                                authorities would object to our Indians joining them for the same
                                purpose, or to their visiting their friends, provided they were
                                furnished with a permit from the person authorized to issue such on
                                this side. This system would answer for the Assiniboines, who also
                                have relations living south of the line.</p>
                            <p>With the Crees it is different. The only object they can have for
                                going south is to hunt or steal horses, and, with buffalo so scarce,
                                I think there would be no object in giving them permits.</p>
                            <p>I think if an arrangement could be made with the United States
                                Government in the direction suggested by his excellency the
                                Governor-General, and the Indians were formally notified of it, it
                                would assist us in inducing a large number of Crees to go north, as
                                they would have to understand that any found in United States
                                territory without the required permission would be arrested.</p>
                            <p>At any rate I think it would be more advisable to endeavor to bring
                                about an arrangement of this nature with the American Government
                                than to assent to the proposition made by the minister at
                                Washington, through Mr. L. S. Sackville West, to his excellency the
                                Governor-General, which I am convinced is impracticable.</p>

                        <p>With reference to correspondence, which has passed between Her Majesty’s
                            legation and the United States Government with regard to alleged killing
                            of cattle and stealing of horses belonging to inhabitants of the United
                            States, by Canadian Indians, the following extract from the annual
                            report of the Indian commissioner for the Northwest Territories appears
                            to place that matter in what is probably its true light: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In 1879 a large number of Blackfeet and Bloods went south to hunt
                                    buffalo. Most of these remained in American territory until the
                                    summer. Prior to their leaving they had been living on the
                                    buffalo, and were still in a wild, uncivilized state. They had
                                    realized the beneficial results of the advent of the mountain
                                    police and the stamping out of the whisky traffic, and had we
                                    been in a position at that time to have kept them on the
                                    reserves, I am sure (says the commissioner) they would have been
                                    much more contented than they are; but, understanding the
                                    position they were in, and that the Sioux were keeping the
                                    buffalo from them, they had no alternative but to strike out for
                                    the south, where they had been informed they could get meat,
                                    and, at the same time, robes for clothing and leather.</p>
                                <p>While on the American side they had a good hunt, and had the
                                    whisky traders been kept away from them they might have returned
                                    in better circumstances than when they left. As it was they were
                                    followed by the lowest class of thieves and whisky traders, who,
                                    in exchange for robes, supplied the Indians with horses, then
                                    made them drunk, and drove the horses off. It was when on foot
                                    that they commenced stealing from each other, from the American
                                    Indians, and, to some extent, from the whites.</p>
                                <p>Complaints were made to the Government of Washington that British
                                    Indians were killing cattle, and there was some excitement among
                                    the cattle-men.</p>
                                <p>I think it is likely that while on their horse-stealing
                                    expedition a few cattle might have been killed by our Indians,
                                    but from information received on the Missouri River, I am
                                    satisfied that the loss sustained by the cattle-men was not as
                                    large as was represented, and that the severe weather had more
                                    to do with it than had the Indians. Although our Indians got the
                                    credit of killing all that was missing, it is well known <pb
                                        n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0395"/>that the American
                                    Indians committed the hulk of the depredations. Our Indians are
                                    in this position. The Indian traders on the Missouri hold out
                                    great inducements to them to go south and hunt, and to this end
                                    fee the chiefs, while the United States Government instruct the
                                    military to drive them back should they come south across the
                                    boundary.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is hoped that under these circumstances the United States Government
                            will take into serious consideration the expediency of adopting in
                            concert with the Dominion Government measures based upon the suggestions
                            of the Marquis of Lorne for preventing Indian raids, and which were
                            communicated to the Department of State in the note of the 4th
                            ultimo.</p>

                            that Big Bear, with five hundred lodges of Cree Indians, intends to

                            Canadian Indians across the boundary for the purpose of trading with
                            them, and in selling them whisky so that they might be robbed while

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your several communications
                            respecting the differences between Guatemala and Mexico, I have now the
                            honor to state for your information the position of the question so far
                            as the United States have taken part in it.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th of June last, Mr. Ubico informed Mr. Blaine, that all
                            peaceful measures of conciliation appeared to be exhausted, and appealed
                            on behalf of his government to the United States, as the natural
                            protector of the Central American territory. Thereupon Mr. Blaine, on
                            the 16th of June, instructed Mr. Morgan, the minister of the United
                            States in Mexico, to offer to Mexico the good offices of the United
                            States, and informed Mr. Ubico that he had done so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Morgan complied with this instruction, and made a formal tender of
                            the good offices of the United States as mediator.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently Mr. Morgan, without further instructions from this
                            Department, but with its acquiescence and in full accord with the
                            suggestions, written and verbal, of the minister for Guatemala, proposed
                            verbally to Mr. Mariscal that the differences between Guatemala and
                            Mexico should be submitted to the decision of the President of the
                            United States as arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Morgan’s course in this respect was approved, and he was further
                            instructed by Mr. Blaine as follows, on the 28th November last: <quote

                                <p>If the Government of Mexico should he disposed to accept an

                                    the Guatemalan minister, indicated would be acceptable to his
                                    government, you will ask the assurance of the Mexican Government
                                    that, pending the discussion necessary to perfect such an

                                    consistent with its views to accept a friendly intervention in
                                    the differences between itself and Guatemala, you will inform
                                    the secretary for foreign affairs that you accept this decision
                                    as undoubtedly within the right of Mexico to make. You will
                                    express the very deep and sincere regret which this government
                                    will feel if it shall find the powerful Republic of Mexico
                                    unwilling to join the Government of the United States in
                                    maintaining and establishing the principle of friendly
                                    arbitration for international differences on the continent of
                                    America. Mexico and the United States, acting in cordial
                                    harmony, can induce all the other independent governments of
                                    North and South America to aid in fixing this policy of peace
                                    for all the future disputes between the nations of the western
                                    hemisphere. And it would be a marked and impressive precedent,
                                    if, in a dispute with a weaker neighbor, Mexico should frankly
                                    consent to a friendly arbitration of all existing
                                    differences.</p>

                        <p>On the 20th of March last Mr. Mariscal communicated to Mr. Morgan the
                            answer of the Mexican Government, in language of which I inclose a copy
                            in the Spanish text, and of which the following is a translation: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Coming down to the propositions which you submitted to me, I have
                                    been instructed by the President to answer in the following
                                    terms:</p>
                                <p>As respects the first, I must observe that the principal
                                    controversy which has excited Guatemala is the one which relates
                                    to the right by which Mexico holds the State of Chiapas, as one
                                    of the members of the Federal Union, including the territory of
                                    Soconusco, which forms a part thereof, but, as has been
                                    explained on a former occasion, the Mexican Government finds
                                    itself in the absolute impossibility of discussing or of
                                    submitting the rights of the nation to this portion of her
                                    territory to any judgment. For the same reason it is not
                                    possible to submit all the differences which exist between the
                                    two governments to arbitration, as you propose should be done.
                                    Besides, if the Guatemalan Government will agree to expressly
                                    exclude the one which relates to Chiapas and Soconusco, the
                                    Mexican Government will not find it inconvenient to submit to a
                                    determinate arbitration, which would be limited to the question
                                    of boundary, which then surged between the two countries.</p>
                                <p>I say “which then surged,” because the pretensions of Guatemala
                                    upon the whole or a portion of that Mexican State frankly
                                    eliminated (from the discussion?), the questions which have
                                    scarcely been mentioned with reference to the boundary of
                                    Soconusco would be from that time easily arranged, without the
                                    necessity of appealing to an arbitrator.</p>
                                <p>The aforesaid pretensions of acquiring in whole or in part the
                                    territory to which I refer, or of obtaining a compensation
                                    therefor, whether the same has been expressly stipulated, or
                                    whether in a disguised form, has been, and is, the only
                                    difficulty between the two governments. If it should disappear
                                    by reason of a sensible abandonment, which the Guatemalan
                                    Government would make of such unfounded aspirations, there would
                                    probably be no necessity for an arbitration to decide any point
                                    of difference upon the question of boundary (between the two
                                    countries), besides removing the great reason for disagreement
                                    which up to now has divided us.</p>
                                <p>The second proposition, to the effect that the Mexican forces be
                                    withdrawn from the frontier, pending the arbitration, cannot be
                                    decided upon at the present moment; to maintain our forces upon
                                    our territory, and near the line provisionally recognized by
                                    Guatemala, will depend upon the circumstances arising during the
                                    arbitration, if an arbitrator be agreed upon, or even if an
                                    agreement should be concluded to arbitrate.</p>
                                <p>The object of maintaining a personal force on the frontier
                                    alluded to, whose numbers are far from alarming, is to prevent
                                    the incursions of armed Guatemalans, from which our frontier
                                    population has suffered, because of the absence ordinarily of a
                                    Mexican soldier there. This government has never in any way
                                    pretended to menace Guatemala with an invasion with these
                                    troops, and no one has thought of such a thing.</p>
                                <p>Your third proposition consists in the formal offer that the
                                    President of the United States shall be the arbitrator between
                                    the two Governments of Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
                                <p>Within the limitations expressed, that is to say, not including
                                    in the arbitration the right which Mexico has to the whole of
                                    the territory which to day comprises the State of Chiapas, the
                                    Government of Mexico is disposed to admit and will admit with
                                    pleasure the arbitration of the President of the United States,
                                    for the purpose of deciding any question which may require the
                                    employment of such a method and which is susceptible of being
                                    decided by it in determining the boundary of both nations.</p>
                                <p>Notwithstanding, we cannot at the present time know if any such
                                    questions will arise, as this question has not up to date been
                                    discussed by Guatemala, except one which relates to its boundary
                                    with our country, and this always under the precautions and from
                                    the second point of view which has been above referred to.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I informed you of this proposition verbally. Since communicating it to
                            you I learn through several notes from you, and more especially <pb
                                n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0400"/>your notes of the 2d and the
                            28th of May last, that direct negotiations for arbitration are taking
                            place between you and Mr. Romero. In your note of the 2d you
                            communicated to me for my information a proposition from Mr. Romero to
                            you to submit the question of boundary to the arbitration of the
                            President of the United States, and your proposed amendment of the
                            second article. In your note of the 28th you inform me that there is a
                            probability that the proposal of Mr. Romero will be withdrawn and that
                            war will ensue.</p>
                        <p>In reply I am instructed by the President to say that he would see a
                            state of war on the continent of North America between two republics of
                            common origin and language with profound solicitude and regret. No
                            reasonable efforts on the part of this government as a neutral friend to
                            both will be spared to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the draft for a convention submitted to you by Mr. Romero
                            contained ten articles, and that you accepted all except the second
                            article. You proposed to substitute your own draft for Article 2. The
                            difference between you and Mr. Romero is, then, reduced to this article,
                            and appears to be as follows: <table rows="2" cols="2">

                        <p>I thought it my duty informally and unofficially to endeavor to ascertain
                            the causes of the difference. I am told by Mr. Romero that Mexico has
                            for years regarded, and still regards, the State of Chiapas as an
                            integral part of the Federal Republic of Mexico, in the same sense as
                            the State of New York is an integral part of this republic, and that he
                            cannot give his assent to any scheme of arbitration which does not
                            exclude the idea of submitting that question to arbitration. He adds
                            that he has so informed you; that he told you that in laying the <hi
                                rend="italic">projet</hi> before you he did it without authority
                            from his government, but that he thinks it will be acquiesced in by his
                            government, if accepted by yours.</p>
                        <p>The interest which the President takes in the prosperity of Guatemala and
                            the confidence reposed by you and your government in the United States
                            must be my excuse for these unauthorized inquiries of Mr. Romero.</p>
                        <p>While offering this personal explanation, I beg leave to renew the
                            official assurance that the President will gladly lend his good offices
                            to bring about a solution of this unfortunate question if a basis can be
                            found that is acceptable to both Guatemala and Mexico.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The communication of your excellency of
                            the 5th instant, which I had the honor to receive in New York, deserves
                            my highest attention and respect.</p>
                        <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>In it your excellency presents to me a parallel between the proposition
                            designated by Señor Romero as No, 2 and that which I present in
                            substitution.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency tells me that Señor Romero considers that Chiapas, as a
                            State, belongs to Mexico in like manner as New York belongs to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Señor Romero will permit me to answer in this manner:</p>
                        <p>New York was one of the thirteen colonies which became independent of
                            England, and no nation in the world has ever alleged that she does not
                            belong to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Chiapas belonged to Guatemala for three hundred years.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1824 she was declared a part of the Mexican Republic in
                            virtue of an illegal plebiscite, inasmuch as the votes were not taken
                            before two commissioners, one of Mexico and the other of Guatemala, as
                            was agreed upon, but only before the commissioner of Mexico, a Mexican
                            force being at the time imposed on the frontier.</p>
                        <p>Soconusco belonged to Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>A treaty between Mexico and Guatemala arranged, in 1829, that neither the
                            forces of Mexico nor of Guatemala shall enter Soconusco until a treaty
                            touching boundaries shall decide the questions.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1842 the Mexican General Santa Anna, breaking that treaty,
                            entered Soconusco and annexed it to Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Here is the title by which Mexico possesses Socunusco.</p>
                        <p>Very different is the title by which the United States holds the State of
                            New York.</p>
                        <p>After the outrage of Santa Anna, Mexico declared that Chiapas and
                            Soconusco should form a State of the Federation, and therefore does not
                            desire that it shall be submitted to arbitration to ascertain the right
                            or title by which the Mexicans possess Soconusco.</p>
                        <p>This is to sanction the law of conquest.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is easier to a nation relatively strong than to take territory
                            from one that is weak; and nothing is more easy, after such territory
                            has been taken, than to say in a law that that territory constitutes
                            part of the nation which has taken it, and consequently not to reduce
                            the question to arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The theories of Mexico are essentially doctrines which sanctify in the
                            New World the law of force and the law of conquest.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to terminate this disagreeable and mournful
                            question, and nothing will be more gratifying to Guatemala than to
                            terminate it under the influence of a mediator of a common friend—the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Would that the arbitration be not limited to this line, but lay down the
                            entire divisional line between the Mexican States and the Republic of
                            Guatemala, even although for this location two or three years more would
                            be necessary.</p>
                        <p>In November I had the honor to say to Mr. Blaine, and afterwards I had
                            the honor to repeat to your excellency, that Guatemala places the matter
                            in the hands of the Government of the United States. In this view your
                            excellency may dictate the bases of the arbitration.</p>
                        <p>Please settle with Señor Romero such bases, under the full confidence
                            that I will subscribe to whatever you will settle.</p>
                        <p>I am your excellency’s, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The historical statements in your letter
                            of the 15th of June, reply to mine of the 5th of June, in relation to
                            the efforts of the Government of the United States to bring about a good
                            understanding between Guatemala and Mexico, touching the boundary
                            dispute between them, have been read with much interest. I permit myself
                            to say, however, that they scarcely seem to touch the only questions
                            which Mr. Mariscal’s observations left open for the President’s
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>If Mexico were willing to accept the terms and conditions of arbitration
                            offered by you on behalf of Guatemala, the President would be much
                            pleased to act as the umpire between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if Guatemala is willing to accept the terms and
                            conditions named by Mr. Romero, and desires that the President should
                            act as such umpire, the President is willing to do so.</p>
                        <p>But if the parties desire the President in any contingency to act as
                            umpire, it is manifestly improper for him to consider and express an
                            opinion in advance in favor of either party upon the merits of the case,
                            or upon the scope of the subject to be submitted.</p>
                        <p>It will, therefore, be perceived that without a more definite statement
                            as to the wishes of your Government on the latter point, the President
                            is unable to act with a reasonable certainty that he is carrying out
                            those wishes.</p>
                        <p>Accept, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to inform your
                            excellency that the President of the Republic of Guatemala, who is now
                            in this capital, has instructed me personally, and in the most special
                            manner, to address myself to your excellency in the terms which I am
                            about to set forth with reference to the boundary question pending
                            between Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
                        <p>My government, in the interest of harmony and of the good relationship
                            which should be maintained between neighboring countries, desires to
                            avoid all the difficulties which might place themselves in the way of a
                            speedy and amicable solution. These difficulties have consisted hitherto
                            in the discussion of the rights of both republics to the territory of
                            Chiapas, including Soconusco. Therefore the President desires that this
                            point may be no obstacle in arriving at an end of the business, and,
                            believing that nothing would be so opportune as to have the United
                            States of America, a power friendly to the two countries, which gives
                            them all the guarantees of impartiality and justice, and with respect to
                            which there should be good reason to believe, too, that it possesses <pb
                                n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0403"/>the unlimited confidence of
                            both, consent to take upon itself to put an end to this controversy. He
                            asks, through me, that the United States, by its mediation and in virtue
                            of an arbitration, will do the Republic of Guatemala the inestimable
                            service of giving a decision which shall fix the dividing boundaries
                            between Guatemala and Mexico, in the sense above set forth.</p>
                        <p>In order to attain this result, the President of Guatemala eliminates the
                            difficulty touching Chiapas and Soconusco, which is the obstacle
                            hitherto set up on behalf of Mexico, and consequently the boundaries
                            which it pertains to the arbitrator to fix, are those between Chiapas
                            and the Republic of Guatemala throughout their proper extent.</p>
                        <p>The President of Guatemala expresses to your excellency, through me, his
                            desire that his Excellency the President of the United States of America
                            will consent to accept the position of arbitrator in order to define
                            this question within the proposed terms. It would be very gratifying to
                            him to know if the President will be pleased to accept this charge on
                            this basis, so that he may thereupon inform the Government of Mexico of
                            the request which he has thus made to the Government of this republic
                            (United States), and to learn if it (Mexico) accepts, for its part, the
                            suggestion and the arbitration proposed by Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>In case of its acceptance (by Mexico), and the remaining details
                            thereupon being decided, the matter will forthwith be submitted to his
                            Excellency’s decision; and in the remote contingency of its not being
                            accepted, Guatemala will have thus taken a step which unequivocally
                            demonstrates the sincerity of its intention to terminate this question,
                            even though imposing upon itself a costly sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>I take, therefore, the liberty of troubling your excellency, begging you
                            to be pleased to honor me with a response which will show whether his
                            Excellency, the President of the United States of America will consent
                            to accept the nomination which the Republic of Guatemala offers to him
                            for this delicate charge. If the response be favorable, as I am led to
                            believe it will be, by the expressions which his Excellency the
                            President, and your excellency likewise, have had the goodness to make
                            to the chief of the nation which I represent, and to myself, it will be
                            duly announced on behalf of Guatemala to Mexico, to the end that if it
                            (Mexico) accepts and adheres to the suggestion, the matter may forthwith
                            remain subject to the enlightened decision of his Excellency the
                            President of this republic.</p>
                        <p>I have much pleasure in stating to your excellency that the Government of
                            the Republic of Guatemala will be profoundly grateful to that of the
                            United States of America for the acts of noteworthy deference which its
                            acceptance will imply.</p>
                        <p>This gratifying opportunity affords me the honor of assuring you once
                            more that I am your excellency’s very faithful and respectful
                            servant,</p>

                            of the 21st instant, in which, with reference to the questions
                            heretofore discussed between <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0404"
                            />Guatemala and Mexico concerning the boundaries between them, you state
                            that the President of Guatemala, being in this capital, has instructed
                            you to apply, through me, for the exercise of the good offices of this
                            government in bringing about a conclusion of the difficulty between the
                            two countries, within the terms expressed in your letter.</p>
                        <p>As I understand those terms, the Government of Guatemala, in the interest
                            of harmony, removes altogether its claim advanced to the possession of
                            Chiapas, including Soconusco, and desires that the President of the
                            United States will signify his assent to the proposal of Guatemala that
                            he shall act as arbitrator in tracing the boundary line between
                            Guatemala on the one hand and the State of Chiapas—including, as stated,
                            Soconusco—on the other, and not elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the question thus, the President directs me to say that if
                            an agreement be reached between Guatemala and Mexico, tendering to him
                            the post of arbitrator for the determination of the boundary line, on
                            bases of submission, to be specified in such agreement, he will have
                            great pleasure in accepting the high trust proposed.</p>
                        <p>Your note leads me to believe that, with the announced elimination of the
                            question of territorial right to the disputed district, and the offer to
                            narrow the scope of the arbitration to the physical determination of a
                            boundary line, the negotiation between yourself and Mr. Romero has
                            progressed so far toward a pacific and harmonious solution that the
                            remaining details of a settlement will offer no difficulty. Accept,
                            &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In pursuance of instructions from his
                            Excellency the President of the Republic of Guatemala, I have the honor
                            to address your excellency, for the purpose of informing you that, as
                            his Excellency told your excellency he intended to do, he addressed the
                            Government of the United States of Mexico, in order to bring about a
                            settlement of the boundary question, which was pending with Guatemala,
                            and in order to stipulate that it should be decided by the arbitration
                            of his Excellency the President of the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>A frank and friendly understanding having been reached with the
                            representative of the Mexican Republic at Washington, the preliminary
                            basis of a treaty was signed at New York, on the 12th of August last.
                            According to said basis, the dividing line between the Republic of
                            Guatemala and that of Mexico will be drawn the province of Chiapas and
                            its department of Soconusco being considered as an integral part of the
                            territory of the United States of Mexico. According to the same basis,
                            when the line is drawn, actual possession is to be respected, and if the
                            two governments cannot agree, a commission will be appointed to draw it;
                            and according to said basis, in case of a disagreement, recourse will be
                            had to the Government of the United States of America, in order that his
                            Excellency the President may decide it in the capacity of arbitrator,
                            without appeal.</p>
                        <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0405"/>
                        <p>In the preliminary convention it was also stipulated that, within six
                            months from the date on which it was signed, the final boundary treaty
                            should be signed in the city of Mexico, and the minister of Guatemala in
                            that republic has already sent telegrams stating that the final treaty
                            has now been signed.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency General Barrios was awaiting this information, in order to
                            communicate it to your excellency’s government, but not having as yet
                            received it, and having made all the preparations to return to this
                            country, he has deemed it his duty to transmit this information
                            concerning all that has taken place. On his arrival in Guatemala, and
                            when the treaty shall have been received, the department of foreign
                            relations will send your excellency a copy thereof, and likewise of the
                            preliminary basis decided upon at New York.</p>
                        <p>The President entertains the pleasing hope that the matter will be
                            satisfactorily settled, and he thinks that it will perhaps be
                            unnecessary to trouble his Excellency the President of the United States
                            of America to act as arbitrator in the case. He nevertheless trusts that
                            if it shall be necessary to have recourse to him, according to the
                            stipulations of the treaty, he will be pleased, as he promised, to do
                            the two countries the great favor of settling the question by his
                            arbitration whenever they may solicit it.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself of this occasion to offer your excellency and your
                            government, in the name of the President of Guatemala and also in my
                            own, the warmest thanks for the kind welcome that was extended to us on
                            our arrival in this hospitable country, and for the attention which the
                            government was pleased to show to the chief magistrate of the Guatemalan
                            nation, and I have the honor to assure you that I am, with the most
                            distinguished consideration, your very obedient servant,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your No. 114, and to my No. 209,
                        I have the honor now to present my report as much in detail as seems to be
                        practicable.</p>
                    <p>The figures as to unoccupied available lands for sugar and rice promised me
                        by a merchant who was formerly editor of a newspaper and afterward in the
                        government service (<hi rend="italic">vide</hi> No. 209) have not been
                        forthcoming, though I have exerted myself to the utmost to obtain them. I
                        must say that there does not seem to be any special alacrity to make an
                        exhibit of the quantity of available sugar lands still unoccupied. Such
                        facts as I have been able to gather will appear further along.</p>
                    <p>With this explanation I take up the consideration of some matters and
                        questions affecting the future of the Sandwich Islands.</p>
                    <p>I. The aboriginal native race is not only in its decline, but the immigrant
                        population is rapidly on the rise. The decadence of the native race is not
                        only in its numbers, but in every component of strength known in the
                        constituent elements of the state or commonwealth. Out of a population of
                        about 45,000 natives of aboriginal descent, all told, there are over 700 who
                        are condemned and isolated lepers, at the leper settlement on Molokai.</p>
                    <p>Physicians of the highest standing estimate that there are from 3,000 to
                        5,000 concealed lepers in the islands. The government physician at the free
                        dispensary in Honolulu, Dr. Fitch, reports officially—and the figures are
                        given in the philo-Hawaiian Pacific Commercial Advertiser of Mr. Gibson, for
                        Saturday, April 8, two days ago—that out of 4,055 <hi rend="italic">new
                            cases</hi> treated by him for the first quarter of 1882, 2,748 were
                        syphilis and 508 leprosy diseases, not only incurable but unavoidably
                        transmissible by heredity as well as by contagion and infection. In the same
                        report are 51 more cases of other venereal diseases, making the frightful
                        total of 3,307 persons afflicted with diseases of this class, out of 4,055
                        cases treated, leaving only 748 for all other diseases, even such as coughs,
                        colds, &amp;c. This is the report of a government physician, where the law
                        requires that lepers be isolated and sent to Molokai, yet there are 508
                        lepers open applicants for relief, in one quarter’s time, in the single
                        district of Honolulu. Dr. Fitch says further: “The disease is everywhere
                        among us: members of the police, soldiers, the band, pastors of churches,
                        teachers, students, are all among the sufferers.” He says further, in the
                        same report, that at a recent meeting of physicians in Honolulu, one of the
                        oldest and most favorably known physicians of the islands stated his belief
                        that four-fifths of the native population of the islands are infected with
                        syphilis, and Dr. Fitch says “I believe this statement too mild.”</p>
                    <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0407"/>
                    <p>The report is not officially promulgated yet. I will ask to forward copies
                        hereafter, as part of the inclosures herewith.</p>
                    <p>To these terrible antecedents must be added constantly increasing sterility
                        and impotency, and in a large degree more and more foggy perceptions in
                        sexual morals. The physique is, therefore, from all these causes,
                        deteriorating frightfully, and the <hi rend="italic">morale</hi> is falling
                        still lower. The robust race of the ancient Kanaka has shriveled and
                        dwindled to this melancholy handful, some of whom are still of noble
                        physique and all of whom are of amiable character, but too many of whom are
                        crippled by rheumatism, syphilis, paralysis, or leprosy. They are crippled,
                        alike in person, in morals, and in fortune—in mind, body, and estate. Where
                        sugar and rice planting are the chief industries, there is, I am assured,
                        not one Kanaka of pure blood in all the islands who owns or exclusively
                        operates a plantation. Some serve faithfully as contract laborers for
                        foreign proprietors, and some put in small lots on shares, but they do not
                        own or operate the plantation. The town-bred natives of the lower class are
                        too unstable for any systematic work, and cannot be depended upon. There is
                        no mercantile or manufacturing business in the kingdom that is owned and
                        managed by a native of full blood. On the other hand, Americans, English,
                        Germans, or more largely still, Hawaiian-Americans and Englishmen (or to use
                        a better-understood term not in vogue here, <hi rend="italic">Creoles</hi>),
                        own and operate the sugar plantations. Rice is almost exclusively in the
                        hands of the Chinese. Cattle ranches are largely operated by Portuguese. And
                        the thousand and one little shops, bakeries, restuarants, and the like, are
                        in the hands of Chinese, Portuguese, and other foreigners.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese already constitute more than half the <hi rend="italic">adult
                            male</hi> population of the kingdom. The Portuguese are increasing
                        rapidly. American capital is increasing much more rapidly than American
                        population. All these hungry hordes of foreigners bring with them habits of
                        industry and thrift, to which the poor Kanaka is nearly a stranger, and he
                        is rapidly going to the wall, clutching wildly at every straw for national
                        life.</p>
                    <p>South Sea Islanders, not only of lower type than the Hawaiian, but savage and
                        lawless, and without either the noble physique or the amiable character of
                        the ancient Kanaka, have been brought, at great expense, to transfuse the
                        blood of a so-called cognate race into the dying Kanaka people; and the
                        result has been failure. As fast as their contracts expire they prefer to
                        return to the low cocoa-nut islands. Even if successful, the experiment must
                        have resulted in lowering the type of the Kanaka by the infusion of an
                        inferior race. Large expense has been incurred, also, in bringing
                        Portuguese, Norwegians, and others, as laborers and as population; but this
                        mostly results in simple substitution of the alien for the Kanaka race—a
                        result which does not greatly delay the ultimate absorption of the native
                        race into a new fusion of different nationalities of more or less
                        contradictory character and habitat originally.</p>
                    <p>It is not alone that the commoners of the race are disappearing at the rate
                        of one and a half per cent, per annum; it is even worse with the “chiefs.”
                        The “House of Nobles” is created by the sovereign, and is not necessarily of
                        “chief” blood—I do not refer to it. Nearly half of the members of the “House
                        of Nobles” are whites or half-castes. But the natives are still of feudal
                        temper, and their attachment to the native <hi rend="italic">aliis</hi> or
                        chiefs is deep and abiding, incapable of transfer or substitution. The
                        constitution requires that the sovereign shall be of the native <hi
                            rend="italic">alii</hi> or “high chief” blood. Of all the royal family
                        and collateral there is but <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0408"/>one
                        frail little girl, half-white daughter of Princess Likelike, to represent
                        the second generation. Queen Douager Emma is childless. Queen Kapiolaui has
                        no children. The Princess Luka (Ruth), sister of the late Kamehamehas, has
                        no heir of her body to her name or her large estate. Mrs. Panaki Bishop,
                        daughter of old chief Paki, has never had a child, and has once refused the
                        nomination to the succession. Unless the genealogical tables of the kingdom
                        shall be reformed and enlarged, there is no other family left eligible to
                        the throne. One life alone in the next generation, the little half-white
                        girl constitutes the reserve of high-chief blood to draw from, and even that
                        is not accepted by the body of the natives. They do not recognize the
                        Kalakaua family as true high chief blood. The distinction is made painfully
                        apparent when any of the present royal family are brought in contact
                        publicly with Queen Emma or Princess Luka.</p>
                    <p>With the native race rapidly disappearing, and the high-chief blood nearly
                        exhausted, with already a majority of the adult males in the kingdom of
                        alien races; with a constitution resting upon a moribund constituency, and
                        relying for functional life upon nearly defunct agencies, what future is
                        there for the native race and the existing dynasty of the Sandwich
                        Islands.</p>
                    <p>As part of an American Zollverein, part of our productive and commercial
                        system, the problem of replenishment of the vital forces of Hawaii demands
                        consideration of us. If we will not have it drift away into Asiatic
                        possession, and an oriental civilization, or have it drawn into a British
                        protectorate through the introduction of East Indian coolies, the wards of
                        Great Britain, we must be watchful.</p>
                    <p>Leaving out of account every consideration except the good of the Hawaiian
                        Islands, our own American colored race can supply a more desirable
                        population, without drawing too heavily upon our resources, than any of
                        these other races or peoples now in prospect.</p>
                    <p>II. There are, strictly speaking, no government lands suitable for homesteads
                        or small holdings. There are no homestead lasws. Lands to till “on shares,”
                        or small quantities for rent, may be had, and planters with mills are glad
                        to encourage independent production in this way. But, in this as in other
                        countries, sugar-planting is a business requiring large capital. It is one
                        of the disabilities of the native, that he seldom or never has capital
                        enough to carry on a plantation. To remove this disability, native statesmen
                        in the legislative assembly have made grotesque efforts, which would be
                        ludicrous if they were not pathetic. In order to put the native on an
                        equality with the <hi rend="italic">Haole</hi> in this respect, it was
                        gravely proposed in the last legislative assembly to make an impossible loan
                        of ten million dollars, a great part of the proceeds of which were to have
                        been disposed of by government in helping poor Kanakas, (“who could not get
                        money at Bishop’s Bank” having no security to offer) to buy lands and
                        machinery, and become rich planters at a bound, by act of the legislative
                        assembly and use of the public credit. One Hoapili Baker, in 1880, issued a
                        manifesto full of such absurdities, a copy of which was inclosed with my
                        dispatch No. 104, April 10, 1880. This manifesto, so ridiculed before the
                        election, made its reputed author a legislator, and it was soon found that
                        the real author had a party behind him which came near wrecking the kingdom
                        with disastrous projects threatening practical confiscation of American and
                        other foreign capital invested here. The same author has again put forth a
                        manifesto, before the late election, fathered this time by a statesman named
                        Lilikalaui, and subscribed by Walter Murray Gibson and others, elected
                        afterward to the next legislative assembly, called to meet on the 29th <pb
                            n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0409"/>instant. I inclose three copies
                        separate, as printed matter. The absurdity of this document should not
                        mislead anybody as to its mischievous and dangerous power over the native
                        mind clothed with legislative functions. I only state the prevailing public
                        opinion among intelligent foreigners here, when I state that the firm and
                        prudent action of the resident diplomatic body alone saved the country from
                        bloodshed and probable revolution, during the Moreuo <hi rend="italic"
                            >regime</hi>, in 1880, when the Hoapili manifesto was sought to be put
                        in action. Like trouble is expected at the coming session for 1882, as
                        indicated by the Lilikalaui manifesto The King and all natives long with a
                        desperate longing for a complete Kanaka ascendency, and they do not see any
                        better way to accomplish this than through legislation practically charging
                        foreign capital with the support of not only the government but the people
                        as well.</p>
                    <p>III. The question how much available sugar and rice land is still unoccupied,
                        and how much further expansion may be expected in the productive industries
                        of the islands, is one upon which I have found it difficult to obtain data,
                        as already before stated.</p>
                    <p>It will appear from the inclosures that I early applied to the foreign office
                        without success; that I was promised reliable data from private sources,
                        which have not been forthcoming; finally, on the 18th of March, The Pacific
                        Commercial Advertiser published statistics purporting to come from the
                        minister of the interior (inclosure No. 2), and a tabular statement of
                        unoccupied lands made up in 1872 (inclosure No. 3), with interesting
                        comments by the editor, Mr. Walter Murray Gibson (inclosure No. 4), which
                        seemed to cover the points desired. I thereupon addressed the minister of
                        foreign affairs, requesting to know how far these statistics might be taken
                        as reliable (inclosure No. 5), and received his reply, discrediting them
                        almost wholly (inclosure No. 6).</p>
                    <p>I forward all these without further comment; also, separate, as printed
                        matter, three copies of the Commercial Advertiser, of March 25, and one
                        unmutilated copy of March 18, the date from which above clippings are made,
                        sending these simply as possible objects of curiosity to the Secretary of
                        State, and not as regular exhibits for this dispatch.</p>

                        <p>A copy of the following circular requesting statistics on the labor
                            question has been forwarded by his excellency the minister of the
                            interior (as president of the board of immigration) to each known
                            employer of labor in the kingdom:</p>
                        <p>“The board of immigration desire statistics on the subject of labor and
                            request your kind assistance. It is important to know the number of men
                            employed on all the plantations, and their nationality. If this
                            knowledge is accurately obtained, it will enable the board to estimate
                            the number of laborers required for any proposed increase of the sugar
                            crop. For instance, one planter says that his crop of 400 tons was
                            produced by the total labor of 80 men, or 5 tons to the labor of each
                            man. If this estimate should be verified by the experience of all the
                            planters, it would be of great value in determining proximately the
                            number of laborers actually employed in sugar making.</p>
                        <p>“Accurate returns of the different nationalities of the laborers will
                            enable the board to ascertain the movements of immigrants. For instance,
                            it is said that there are 14,000 Chinese in the kingdom. If it should
                            appear that only 5,000 were employed on the sugar estates, it will be
                            possible to estimate the number engaged in rice planting and other
                            occupations; and if the number engaged in rice planting is subsequently
                            obtained, it will be possible to ascertain the number of the floating
                            Chinese population, which is a matter of no little importance.</p>

                        <p>“This request of the hoard may not reach some of those engaged in
                            planting cane only, and therefore the planters are requested to consult
                            their neighbors and obtain statistics from such persons, and from those
                            who employ only a few hands. The returns should show the number of
                            laborers on February 15, 1882.</p>
                        <p>“Upon the return of these statistics a general summary will he made up
                            for the information of the community. I would request that the inclosed
                            blank form he filled up and returned to me.”</p>

                        <p>On Monday, 6th instant, His Majesty paid a visit to Paia, returning to
                            Wailuku the same evening. At Paia His Majesty was entertained at dinner
                            by the inhabitants of the district, and addresses of welcome were
                            presented,</p>
                        <p>His Majesty subsequently went by sea to Hana, remaining there until
                            Thursday last, on which day he proceeded by the steamer Lehua to
                            Lahaina, arriving there in the evening. The town of Lahaina was
                            illuminated in honor of His Majesty’s arrival.</p>
                        <p>From Lahaina His Majesty will return direct to the capital, and may be
                            expected here to-morrow morning.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the development of a decade</hi>.</p>
                        <p>By permission of Ms excellency Wm. N. Armstrong, president of the board
                            of immigration, we are enabled to lay before our readers some very
                            interesting statistics collected by the board in relation to our
                            industrial enterprises and the state of labor in the kingdom at this
                            time; and at the same time we present statistics on the same subject,
                            collected and prepared by the secretary of the immigration society in
                            1872; so that the industrial development of a decade in the country’s
                            history is clearly shown, by these being placed alongside the statistics
                            of 1882.</p>
                        <p>The information obtained, both at the former and later period, is not
                            quite full, but sufficiently approximate to warrant correct deductions
                            with regard to the progress and development of the country.</p>
                        <p>In 1872 there were 12,355 acres cultivated in sugar-cane, with a yield of
                            16,995,402 pounds, for that year, much of the indicated area being newly
                            planted. The estimated laboring force was 3,728 hands which would give
                            an average of nearly 3⅓ acres to the hand.</p>
                        <p>No statistics as to the acreage under cane have yet been taken for this
                            year, but we hope to obtain them hereafter. The force of hands at work
                            (if, as is reasonable, we put down 2,000 for the plantations whose
                            replies have not yet been received) is, in 1882, 10,277, and it is
                            estimated that the crop will be 130,000,000 pounds. Even if we take last
                            year’s crop of 92,393,044 pounds as the product of the laborers
                            scheduled, the comparison between the results, in proportion to the
                            number of hands employed, is very striking. It should be stated that
                            whilst the returns of this year discriminate between field laborers and
                            mill employés, the returns of 1872 did not; there must be, therefore,
                            made a small deduction from the estimate of the field force of that
                            period.</p>
                        <p>The great difference in results shown is to be attributed to increased
                            experience, but more especially to the introduction of improved
                            machinery, and the great extension of means of irrigation. When we
                            consider the large percentage of juice which is now obtained, in
                            comparison with the average secured in 1872, and that at that time
                            immense quantities of molasses were allowed to run to waste whilst now
                            the skimmings, even, well filtered, yield an important percentage of
                            saccharine product, we readily perceive some of the reasons for this
                            great change.</p>
                        <p>In respect to labor, it will be noticed that in 1872 the Hawaiian people
                            supplied the whole labor force, whereas in this year the Chinese supply
                            nearly half of the whole, and other foreign laborers one-fourth.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the statistics which show the preferences for different
                            nationalities of laborers which exist among planters, the most notable
                            feature is the great preference manifested in 1872 for Japanese, who are
                            now not mentioned. There have been no immigrants here from Japan since
                            1868; hence that race is not now considered in the calculations of
                            planters. Portuguese and Chinese are now most largely called for,
                            because they are supposed to be the only races available. But if it were
                            known that Hindoos and Japanese were to be brought here, they would be
                            very generally preferred.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: About two months ago I had the honor to
                            consult your excellency verbally with regard to obtaining certain
                            statistics as to available sugar and rice lands not yet taken up, as to
                            lands available for small holdings, and what inducements are offered by
                            Hawaiian laws in the way of homesteads for immigrants of small means
                            desiring to occupy such small holdings, as to amount and kinds of labor
                            already employed, wages, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>It was not then practicable to supply exact figures or reliable

                        <p>In this week’s Hawaiian newspaper I note what purport to be official
                            figures, founded upon non-official answers to inquiries, covering some
                            of these points, from the office of the minister of the interior.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your dispatch of 23d instant, in which you inquire with
                            regard to obtaining certain statistics, as to available sugar and rice
                            lands not yet taken up, as to lands available for small holdings, and
                            what inducements are offered by Hawaiian laws in the way of homesteads
                            for immigrants of small means, and as to amount and kinds of labor
                            already employed, wages, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I will, if you will allow me, answer the second question first, as to the
                            inducement offered by Hawaiian laws in the way of homesteads for
                            immigrants, by stating that the government possesses no lands, or at
                            least not in sufficient quantity to make it practicable to offer small
                            holdings for immigrants.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, opportunities continually offered by private parties,
                            to planters of sugar-cane who wish to take up small quantities of land.
                            This, however, is in the way of lease, not sale.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the available sugar and rice lands not yet taken up, I
                            regret that the government have no reliable statistics. What appeared in
                            the Pacific Commercial Advertiser of last Saturday week, purporting to
                            give the available sugar lands, was got up hastily by the Planters’
                            Association, in 1872, and is not reliable.</p>
                        <p>I have asked the vice-president of the new Planters’ Association if he
                            could furnish me with reliable statistics, but he informs me that it
                            would require a special committee, and take some months to work them
                            up.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the amount and kinds of labor now employed, the statistics
                            which have appeared in the papers lately are tolerably correct as far as
                            they go, but they are incomplete, and not sufficiently exact and
                            authoritative to be used by you as reliable data in answering
                            instructions from the honorable Secretary of State.</p>
                        <p>I remain, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that the Legislative
                        Assembly of this kingdom was opened by the King in person in the presence of
                        a large concourse, consisting of the diplomatic and consular bodies and
                        notable persons, official and non-official, on the 29th day of April, 1882.
                        Copies of the King’s speech are made inclosure No. 1.</p>
                    <p>I regret to state that although the executive reports are required to be
                        placed before the Legislative Assembly on the first day of the regular
                        session, I have not yet received from the Hawaiian foreign office a copy of
                        any of them, and therefore cannot present to the Secretary of State either
                        the documents themselves or any review by this mail.</p>
                    <p>I feel it my duty to report that grave apprehensions are felt among foreign
                        residents as to the probable action of the Legislative Assembly. The
                        Assembly should be held in check by a careful and conservative Executive,
                        advised and guided by his constitutional ministers.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The native Hawaiians own scarcely any property, yet they control absolutely
                        the rate of taxation and amount of expenditure. The enterprising foreign
                        residents—largely American—who have brought their capital here and are
                        developing the resources of the kingdom, own nearly all the estates, real
                        and personal, and do nearly all the business, <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343"
                            facs="0415"/>yet have only a precarious, indirect, and uncertain control
                        of the rate of taxation and amount of expenditure. Even under the most
                        favorable conditions otherwise, this single misjoinder of the producing with
                        the expending power might be looked upon with apprehension. But the
                        conditions are not favorable otherwise; they are actively and menacingly
                        unfavorable.</p>
                    <p>There is such a state of anxiety in the minds of foreign residents that a
                        number of the most prominent planters and business men have pressed me
                        earnestly for some assurance that the United States Government would protect
                        American citizens against such native legislation as might amount to a
                        practical confiscation of a large share of their estates in these
                        islands.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I can only say to these gentlemen that, however exceptional and anomalous
                        their condition may be in having their property at the mercy of a
                        legislative body beyond their control and inimical to their interests, the
                        same comity is due to this government that would be paid by the Government
                        of the United States to any stronger and more powerful state.</p>
                    <p>While the United States will be behind no other power in protecting its
                        citizens against injustice or a denial of justice under any flag that
                        floats, I have expressed my conviction that the Secretary of State would not
                        approve of any interference with the rights of the Hawaiian kingdom as a
                        sovereign state.</p>
                    <p>It is a difficult question and one of a very practical bearing in the present
                        aspect of affairs here, how far the United States Government may be inclined
                        to go in the protection of its citizens here, under the anomalous
                        circumstances of the existing state of things. Whether a mere “moral
                        support” will suffice in the future for the protection of American interests
                        at stake here, may well be doubled.* * *</p>
                    <p>I respectfully and earnestly ask that the Secretary of State may be pleased
                        to take these matters into consideration, and instruct me how far the United
                        States Government may be willing to go in the protection of the vested
                        interests of our countrymen who remain American citizens, while they have
                        taken advantage of the reciprocity treaty to seek their fortunes in
                        Hawaii.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 217, of the 8th instant, in which you
                        report the political tendencies now making themselves manifest in the
                        islands and the movement in the direction of onerous taxation of capital and
                        property to a degree which cannot fail to work injury to the foreign
                        interests and enterprise which have built up Hawaiian prosperity, has been
                        read with attention.</p>
                    <p>It cannot be doubted that indiscriminate and reckless exercise of the
                        tax-levying power by those portions of the native element who have little
                            <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0416"/>or no taxable interests at
                        stake must react harmfully on the essential elements insular prosperity.
                        Independently of the consideration that a large part of the operating
                        capital and mechanical enterprises of Hawaii has been contributed by
                        citizens of the United States, this government feels itself so kindly bound
                        to Hawaii by the traditions of past intercourse that it would not hesitate
                        to remonstrate with the Hawaiian Government against the adoption of a
                        short-sighted policy which would be alike harmful to existing vested
                        interests and repellant of the further influx of capital from abroad.</p>
                    <p>While this government recognized from the first the constitutional
                        sovereignty of Hawaii, and still recognizes her right to adjust internal
                        matters of taxation and revenue on constitutional principles, yet it cannot
                        permit to pass without very urgent protest in all proper quarters a measure
                        subversive of the material interests of so many of its citizens who, on the
                        faith of international comity, have given their wealth, labor, and skill to
                        aid in the prosperity of Hawaii. And it makes this protest the more
                        earnestly, inasmuch as the treaty relations between the two countries (in
                        which Hawaiian interests were even more subserved than our own) are such as
                        to give the United States the moral right to expect that American property
                        in Hawaii will be no more burdened than would Hawaiian property In the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit correspondence
                        with Peter Cush-man Jones, esq., an American merchant, planter, shipper, and
                        sugar factor residing at Honolulu, as to the present status of Americans who
                        have taken the oath of allegiance to Hawaiian kings (inclosures 1 and
                        2).</p>
                    <p>There are a number of verbal applications of the same sort.</p>
                    <p>The apprehension of wasteful legislation by the ignorant natives who now
                        control the politics of the country through the efforts of white and native
                        demagogues to stir up hatred against the more prosperous foreigner, has
                        moved some of the Americans, who, like Mr. Jones, are most largely
                        interested in business here, to seek such protection of the American
                        flag.</p>
                    <p>The status of these men becomes a matter of importance, and I respectfully
                        ask an instruction from the Secretary of State on this point.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am very desirous of placing myself under
                            the protection of the United States if it is possible for me to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>In order that you may fully understand my case I beg to submit to you the
                            following facts: I am an American by birth, having been born in the city
                            of Boston, Mass., in the year 1837, where my ancestors for many
                            generations were born.</p>
                        <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0417"/>
                        <p>In the year 1857 I came to these Islands and established myself in
                            business, marrying the daughter of Mr. E. 0. Hall, who was connected
                            with the American mission.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1864 I had an opportunity of purchasing a vessel under the
                            Hawaiian flag. I applied to the collector of customs, Mr. W. Goodale, to
                            see if I could arrange to have the vessel placed in the name of some
                            Hawaiian subject in order to avoid taking the oath of allegiance to the
                            Hawaiian Government, as was required by all owning vessels under that
                            flag. He replied that if any person made oath that he was owner of the
                            vessel he would be obliged to take such oath as being true. Not wishing
                            to ask any person to take a false oath I concluded to take the oath of
                            allegiance, after being assured that should I return to Boston I would
                            be entitled to all the rights and privileges of an American citizen
                            after a residence of six months in that city, and also after satisfying
                            myself that I was not called upon to forswear my allegiance to my native
                            country. I herewith submit a copy of the oath taken by me:</p>
                        <p>“The undersigned a native of the United States of America lately residing
                            in Honolulu, being duly sworn, upon his oath declares that he will
                            support the contitution and laws of the Hawauan Islands, and bear true
                            allegiance to His Majesty Kamehameha IV.”</p>
                        <p>Having become a citizen of Hawaii, and having property of my own, I felt
                            it my duty to vote and use my influence on all occasions for good
                            government, and I have always endeavored to do my duty in this respect.
                            But the majority of the voters here are irresponsible natives with
                            little or no property to protect, and I feel a want of security under
                            the present state of things, and am consequently very anxious to feel if
                            possible that I may be secure. I accordingly make this application to
                            you, assuring you of my willingness to renounce my allegiance to Hawaii,
                            and taking any oath, however strong, which will reinstate me as an
                            American citizen. I would add that I have never been a candidate for any
                            political office in the Hawaiian Government, the only object inducing me
                            to swear allegiance to Hawaii being for business purposes. Asking your
                            early consideration of this matter,</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                            receipt of your note dated May 26th, handed to me last night.</p>
                        <p>The oath of allegiance which you have taken differs from the oath of
                            naturalization in the United States, in this, that it does not require
                            the person taking it to renounce in terms any other former allegiance,
                            while the oath of naturalization does require not only a general but a
                            specific renunciation—<hi rend="italic">forever;</hi> first, of “all
                            allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or
                            sovereignty”; and second, “and particularly” by a name, “to the prince,
                            potentate, state, or sovereignty of which the alien may be at the time a
                            citizen or subject.”</p>
                        <p>The question remains whether one does not impliedly renounce his old
                            allegiance in taking up a new one.</p>
                        <p>No one can be a citizen of two countries at once; neither can he lay down
                            and take up his allegiance at his own pleasure or interest.</p>
                        <p>Your application for rehabilitation, so far as this legation is
                            concerned, seems to me to involve only this one question—whether you are
                            a subject of the kingdom to which you have sworn allegiance, or remain a
                            citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>If you are now a citizen, you have been a citizen all along from the
                            beginning, and need no restoration. If you are not a citizen, I do not
                            know of any provision which may restore you to citizenship by six
                            months’ return residence in Boston. The naturalization laws point out
                            the only way, so far as I know, in which one, not a citizen, may become
                            a citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>A number of our countrymen who are in the same uncertain condition as
                            yourself with regard to their citizenship, and who, as well as yourself,
                            have large material interests vested here, and the same grave
                            apprehensions as to the outcome of certain threatened dangers, have
                            lately applied to me verbally, in terms similar to those of your note,
                            intending if possible to claim the protection of the American flag.</p>
                        <p>In order that this legation may be put in a position to give an
                            authoritative response in such cases, I shall take occasion to submit a
                            copy of your note to the honorable Secretary of State, and ask an
                            instruction covering your points of inquiry.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch of the 5th ultimo relative to
                        the case of Mr. Peter Cushman Jones, an American citizen resident in
                        Honolulu, has been received.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jones, as it appears from his letter to you of the 26th of May, a copy of
                        which you inclose, was born in Boston, Mass., in 1837, and in 1857 took up
                        his residence in the Hawaiian Kingdom, entering into mercantile pursuits
                        there as a domiciled American citizen. Becoming the owner of a merchant
                        vessel there under the Hawaiian flag, it became necessary for him, in order
                        to the maintenance of his rights in that kingdom, to take an oath of
                        allegiance to the sovereign of the islands. The form of the oath is set out
                        in Mr. Jones’s letter, thus: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The undersigned, a native of the United States of America, being duly
                                sworn, upon his oath declares that he will support the constitution
                                and laws of the Hawaiian Islands and bear true allegiance to His
                                Majesty, Kamehameha IV.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Your inquiry is as to what effect this proceeding may have upon the status of
                        Mr. Jones’s American citizenship.</p>
                    <p>In becoming a citizen of the United States the law requires that an alien
                        shall not only swear to support the Constitution and laws of this country,
                        but also to renounce all other allegiance and especially that of the country
                        of which he may be then a subject or citizen. In the oath taken by Mr. Jones
                        there is no such express renunciation of his American citizenship, nor do
                        the circumstances manifest any intention on his part to expatriate
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>It may, however, at some future time, become a question for judicial
                        investigation in his case.</p>
                    <p>The doctrine of the executive branch of the government on this subject is
                        thus expressed by the Attorney-General— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>To constitute expatriation there must be an actual removal followed
                                by foreign residence, accompanied by authentic renunciation of
                                pre-existing citizenship. (8 Opinions, 139).</p>
                        </quote></p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit to you a few
                        general observations concerning the political situation in these islands,
                        and beg that they may be accepted less as the convictions of mature inquiry
                        than as conclusions impressed by a brief residence here, conversations with
                        representative men who assist largely in creating public opinion and in
                        shaping political events.</p>
                    <p>The legislature of the kingdom adjourned some days before my arrival here. It
                        seems to have been under complete native control; but this should be matter
                        of little surprise, when it is considered that the natives numerically
                        outnumber the white Americans and Europeans in the islands almost ten to
                        one, and that the ballot is given only to native-born and naturalized
                        citizens.</p>
                    <p>In electing members to the last legislature, two motives at least seem to
                        have inspired the natives in securing control of that body. One was that a
                        loan might be effected, and the necessary appropriations of public money
                        made for the coronation ceremonies, now fixed for the 12th of next February;
                        and the other was a desire to repeal the law, which has been long in force,
                        prohibiting the sale of all intoxicating liquors to the natives. They claim
                        that the law was many years ago enacted through what they call the
                        missionary influence—an influence, I may remark, which for a long period
                        shaped the legislation, and to a very considerable extent controlled the
                        government of these islands, but which is now giving way before changed
                        conditions and increased and constantly increasing commercial activities
                        impatient of restraint. They also claim that the law has been to them a
                        grievous humiliation, inasmuch as under it not only the humble native
                        citizen, but native born ministers of state and other high officers of the
                        kingdom, have been denied social and other privileges accorded to all
                        others.</p>
                    <p>This law was finally repealed during the last legislature, and on and after
                        the 1st of next month liquors may be sold to natives under certain
                        restraints. I do not think the privilege will be greatly abused. The natives
                        of these islands are a singularly tractable, light-hearted, non-combative,
                        and law-abiding people, and, unlike the North American Indian and other
                        meat-eating natives of colder climates, do not generally crave alcoholic
                        stimulants.</p>
                    <p>The repeal of the liquor law, the voting of appropriations for the coming
                        coronation ceremonies, and the authorization of a national loan of two
                        millions of dollars may be regarded as the three most important measures of
                        the last legislature. It is in connection with these that complaint of the
                        opposition finds loudest utterance.* * *</p>
                    <p>The coronation expenses, I do not think, will exceed $50,000, unless the
                        legislature should be convened in extra session, as is contemplated, which
                        would result in an additional expense of perhaps $30,000. I am led to
                        believe that His Majesty may be induced to forego the assemblings of the
                        legislature. Should this be tile case, the expenses of the ceremony—already
                        too far advanced in preparation to be indefinitely deferred without
                        humiliation—will find partial compensation in a temporary increase in trade,
                        and the general gratification of the native population.</p>
                    <p>* * *</p>
                    <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0420"/>
                    <p>The two-million loan, it is claimed, was not a necessity; but, as the entire
                        amount is specifically devoted to the encouragement of immigration, to
                        agriculture, to the construction of railways, to public buildings, and to
                        internal improvements generally, it has something of a claim upon public
                        approval. There can be little question, however, that the loan was
                        authorized by a native legislature with the incentive and full knowledge
                        that the burden of its payment would fall largely upon American and other
                        foreign property-owners in the kingdom.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Taxation is light the laws are well administered; life and property are as
                        secure here as in any part of the civilized world; and with the advantages
                        of the reciprocity treaty the general business of the island is fairly
                        prosperous.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to advise you that on the
                        evening of the 4th day of this month President Salomon left this city upon a
                        short visit to Aux Cayes and Jeremie. His purpose was chiefly, as he stated,
                        to visit the latter place, and, in person, express to the people thereof,
                        whose property was very generally destroyed by fire occurring on the 29th of
                        last August, and who have been therefore in a more or less needy and
                        suffering condition for the past three months, his sympathy.</p>
                    <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0421"/>
                    <p>On his way, on the morning of the 5th instant, he landed at St. Marc, and
                        there spent several hours in consultation with his officers and in receiving
                        the people who flocked about him.</p>
                    <p>Three days thereafter, while the President was at Jeremie, an insurrectionary
                        movement, led by General Désormes Gresseau, formerly the commanding general
                        of the arrondissement of St. Marc, manifested itself in an attempt to take
                        and hold the arsenal of that city. The arsenal was taken, but a loyal
                        sentiment so generally prevailed among the people, and the soldiery behaved
                        so gallantly, that it was soon retaken, and the rebels, who seemed not to
                        number more than fifty or seventy-five, were driven from the city. In the
                        fight several were killed, while five persons who were taken with arms in
                        their hands were shot.</p>
                    <p>The government has announced that General Gresseau, who has been treated in
                        many respects with kind regard by it, and who has several times in marked
                        manner avowed his devotion to the President, doing so even so late as the
                        5th instant, took advantage of the fact that General Turenne Luvieux, at
                        present the commanding general of the arrondissement of St. Marc, was sick,
                        to make this movement. It is said, however, that although the regular forces
                        and the national guard of neighboring arrondissements, at the announcement
                        of this attempt of General Gresseau, offered their services at once to the
                        authorities of St. Marc. Before their arrival General Luvieux, assisted by
                        General Prudo, the commanding officer of the commune of St. Marc, had
                        suppressed this movement.</p>
                    <p>The President in a proclamation addressed to the people and the army,
                        published on the 11th instant, announces the suppression of this movement,
                        compliments his officers and soldiers for their good behavior, declares the
                        number killed and executed, and states that those immediately connected with
                        the movement at St. Marc who have not fallen are in flight; but that the
                        sword shall reach them.</p>
                    <p>This movement is treated by the government as having extended connections.
                        Hence, besides declaring General Gresseau and sixteen of his companions in
                        insurrection, now in flight as outlaws, to be killed whenever found, it has,
                        by virtue of authority conferred upon it by the constitution and the law of
                        the 13th of April, 1880, declared by its order published on the 11th instant
                        that the arrondissements of Port-au-Prince, St. Marc, and Jacmel are in a
                        state of siege; that is, are placed under martial law.</p>
                    <p>Many arrests have already been made in the arrondissements named, and it is
                        altogether probable that others will be made from time to time for several
                        days to come.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the extreme dullness which continues to prevail in general
                        business throughout this country at this time, the political excitement
                        existing in connection with the pending canvass for members of the Chamber
                        of Deputies, whose election takes place on the 10th of next month, and
                        notwithstanding the natural feeling produced by the late insurrectionary
                        movement and the action of the government taken in view thereof, on the part
                        of the people, general quiet and good order seem to obtain, at present, in
                        all parts of the republic.</p>

                        agent at St. Marc to the effect that on the morning of the 23d, at four
                        o’clock, he received into our agency, under his protection, three persons
                        who had been connected with the St. Marc movement. I regret that Mr. Ricci,
                        although he claims that these persons would have been immediately shot if
                        taken, being among those who had been declared outlawed by the government,
                        deemed it his duty to receive them. The government has already inquired of
                        this legation as to their presence in the agency, and I have advised it that
                        they are there. As yet, I am not informed as to its purpose with regard to
                        action in that behalf.</p>
                    <p>I shall certainly insist that any step taken by it shall be in strict
                        accordance with the laws and usage in such cases, and in due respect to the
                        honor and dignity of our government.</p>
                    <p>Hereafter I shall take occasion to refer to this subject, and then furnish
                        the Department copies of the correspondence that has passed between our
                        acting vice-commercial agent, the Haytien Government, and this legation
                        thereon.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to advise the Department that
                        on the 12th instant the President of this republic, with the members of the
                        cabinet, except the honorable secretary of state of the interior, Mr. Edward
                        Pinckombe, who is at present quite sick, and with a considerable part of the
                        army, left this city for Cape Haytien, where his excellency expects to
                        remain for at least fifteen days.</p>
                    <p>This proceeding of the Chief Executive is rendered necessary in view of
                        divers rumors of impending revolutionary movements reaching the capital from
                        the northern section of the republic. By his presence and the display of his
                        military power, in and about the Cape, it is believed that the President may
                        anticipate and suppress any hostile movements <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351"
                            facs="0423"/>that may be in contemplation against the government, and
                        thus prolong the present general quiet of the country.</p>
                    <p>During the absence of the President the general charge of the government has
                        been placed in the hands of a special commission, composed of several
                        prominent citizens and officers.</p>
                    <p>To-day quiet prevails generally throughout the country; and there are no
                        apparent evidences of its early disturbance.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As you have been advised already by this
                        legation, President Salomon is at present in Cape Haytien, called there by
                        rumors from that quarter of the republic of impending revolutionary
                        movements. Leaving the capital on the 12th ultimo, after making short stops
                        at St. Marc and Gonaives, at both of which places he was received, as
                        reported, by the local authorities and the people in the most enthusiastic
                        manner, he arrived on the 15th of last month at the Cape. His reception
                        there is not described in the journals of the country as even cordial. In Le
                        Moniteur it is stated that he was met at the wharf by the troops of the
                        garrison of the Cape, and that they and the troops who had arrived with his
                        excellency paid their respects to him as he left the ship.</p>
                    <p>On the 16th ultimo, accompanied by his cabinet and Generals Tirésias Simon
                        Sam, commandant of the arrondissement of Cape Haytien; Jean Jumeau,
                        commandant of the arrondissement of Gonaives; Turenne Jean Gilles,
                        commandant of the arrondissement of Port de Paix; St. Fleur Paul, commandant
                        of the arrondissement of Marmelade; Seīde Télémaque, commandant of the
                        arrondissement of Grand Riviere of the North, the President attended church
                        at the Cape, where a grand mass was celebrated by the bishop of that place.
                        Then, after a review of the troops and a circuit of the city, repairing to
                        the palace, he delivered to an assembly composed of the civil and military
                        authorities of the place the most remarkable discourse perhaps that has ever
                        been pronounced in Hayti. A copy of this discourse as published in the
                        official section of Le Moniteur of the 22d ultimo, with translation, is
                        herewith inclosed and transmitted to the Department.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances which lead one to characterize this as a remarkable
                        discourse are the circumstances under which and the place where it was
                        pronounced, the extreme loyal sentiments which it contains, and the
                        frankness and fearlessness of their utterance. Here for once the chief
                        Executive of the republic meets the plotters of treason face to face in
                        their strongest hold, and in manly earnestness declares his purpose to hold
                        them in subjection and obedience to the law, compelling them to respect and
                        observe the peace of the country. His interruption of the commandant of the
                        arrondissement of the Cape, General Tirésias Simon Sam, and his severe
                        indirect criticism and accusation of him in the midst of his friends and his
                        soldiery, in the presence of many persons hostile to the present government,
                        who would have been only too glad to secure <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352"
                            facs="0424"/>such a leader as that general, was not only courageous but
                        under the circumstances as overwhelming as it was unexpected.</p>
                    <p>The demonstrations of assent and applause which distinguished the utterance
                        of the extreme loyal sentiments of this address are in an important sense
                        noteworthy. And it is true apparently that like assent and approval thereof
                        prevail now among all classes of the loyal people throughout the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the substance of the address, it is only necessary to refer to
                        the declarations that for two months past, while there has existed peace in
                        all other parts of the republic, there has prevailed disturbance at the
                        Cape; that the President seeks the cause thereof; that he will not leave
                        until he finds and removes it; that he will not tolerate two states in the
                        republic, but will maintain the national unity; and that the condition of
                        the Cape is such, preventing the progress of the country so largely by
                        hindering the government from, giving attention to those things which
                        concern the public administration, that it is intolerable.</p>
                    <p>After such examination of affairs at the Cape and thereabout as he deemed
                        practicable, on the 23d of last month the President, by virtue of the power
                        conferred upon him by the constitution and the law, put, by his order
                        published in the official section of Le Moniteur of the 27th of last month,
                        a copy of which with translation is herewith transmitted, the
                        arrondissements of Cape Haytien, Trou, and Fort Liberté under martial
                        law.</p>
                    <p>There have been arrested as concerned in revolutionary movements to be made
                        at the Cape, some twenty or thirty persons, among whom, and the most
                        prominent, is Senator Monpoint. It is reported that several persons who fear
                        arrest have taken refuge in the consulates of the Cape, and that General
                        Tirésias Simon Sam has been relieved of his command of the arrondissement.
                        Such reports, while they need confirmation, are probably true.</p>
                    <p>It will be fortunate for this republic should the measures adopted by the
                        government to secure good order and quiet at the Cape and in the surrounding
                        country prove to be effective. Peace, good order, and industry constitute
                        to-day the prime wants of the country.</p>
                    <p>At present six arrondissements of the republic are under martial law. In
                        December last, the arrondissements of Port-au Prince, Jacmel, and St. Marc
                        were put in such state by order of the government, and in connection with a
                        revolutionary movement, which was discovered on the 8th day of December
                        last, at St. Marc, fifty-two persons, some at Port-au-Prince, some at
                        Jacmel, and others at St. Marc, were arrested, who, during the last month,
                        have been tried by a military commission, sitting at St. Marc. Six of these
                        persons were released; six were convicted and sentenced to nine years’
                        confinement each in the penitentiary; and forty were convicted and are
                        condemned to death.</p>
                    <p>It is said by some that the government will certainly have these persons
                        executed; by others a contrary opinion is entertained and as earnestly
                        expressed. It is to be hoped that it may be found consistent with the peace
                        and tranquillity of the country, and conservative of the good name and power
                        of the government, to find another mode of disposing of such persons than
                        execution.</p>

                                held at the palace at Cape Haytien on the 16th ultimo, as published
                                in the official part of Le Moniteur, April</hi> 22, 1882.</head>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Friends</hi>: It is eleven months only since I
                            left the Cape, and here I am forced to return to this place. This time
                            it is not for the pleasure of visiting you that I come here, but to
                            perform a task which my duty as President of Hayti imposes upon me.</p>
                        <p>For about two months, in fact, the various reports which I have received
                            have obliged me to give special watchful attention to the city of the
                            Cape. The situation of this city is by no means satisfactory. While
                            tranquillity obtains throughout the republic there is agitation at the
                            Cape.</p>
                        <p>According to the report which is made me daily and what I know, I
                            understand that there is something to be done here, and it is to do that
                            that I am in your midst.</p>
                        <p>To-day I come to witness by view before acting. If there is a sore I will
                            examine it, I will probe it; and be persuaded, my friends, that I will
                            not quit the Cape until I have applied a remedy thereto. (Prolonged
                            applause.)</p>
                        <p>Every time the courier arrives at Port-au-Prince from the Cape, I am
                            forced to assemble my cabinet, and I never do so when I receive news
                            from other parts of the country. The city of the Cape, then, is an
                            obstacle, the only obstacle to the progress of the country. The city of
                            the Cape alone hinders the progress of the entire republic, and seems
                            willing to keep it in check. (Demonstrations of assent.)</p>
                        <p>Such a state of affairs cannot continue, and I come here, my friends, to
                            put an end thereto.</p>
                        <p>All the troops of the department of the North are under arms, which
                            brings to the public treasury outlays the more heavy as our present
                            resources are very straitened.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible that a condition so abnormal should be prolonged. I, the
                            President, will not allow that there be a state in a state. Made
                            President of the Republic of Hayti and not of a part of the republic
                            only, I will not allow for any reason that there be two republics in the
                            country. I do not permit and will not allow that the-national unity be
                            severed. (Thunder of applause and prolonged vivats.)</p>
                        <p>The Cape hinders, arrests the progress of the country. Thanks to it, my
                            government is absorbed in politics and is given no time to occupy
                            itself, as it could wish with the concerns of the public administration.
                            Such condition is intolerable.</p>
                        <p>This is all I have to say to you to-day; very soon I will convoke you, my
                            friends, and I will address you more at length. I do not do it at this
                            time because I have not as yet had the time to examine well the
                            condition. (Renewed vivats.)</p>
                        <p>After these expressions of his Excellency, the President of the republic,
                            General Tirésias Simon Sam, commandant of the arrondissement of the
                            Cape, employed the following words:</p>
                        <p>Truly, President, the Cape hinders and arrests the progress of your
                            government. For three weeks we have been under arms, and it is only,
                            thanks to our threatening attitude, that the enemies have not dared——
                            (Interruption.)</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">President of the Republic.</hi> You speak of
                            enemies, general, but you ought to know them, you ought to know why all
                            the troops of your arrondissement are under arms. As for me, it is
                            necessary that I know these enemies. Yesterday the magistrat communal,
                            in wishing me welcome, spoke to me of the healthy part of the
                            population; it is necessary that I know the unhealthy part, I have come
                            here to know the whole and I will not leave you until I have known and
                            regulated it. (Renewed applause and repeated cries of “Long live the
                            President of Hayti!”)</p>
                        <p>These utterances of his Excellency, the President of the republic, were
                            warmly applauded by the assembly.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to advise you that President
                        Salomon still remains at the Cape, making arrests of persons suspected of
                        having been engaged in late contemplated revolutionary movements. The names
                        of forty-three persons to be arrested are announced in Le Moniteur of the
                        6th instant, in an order published by General T. A. Simon Sam, commandant of
                        the arrondissement of Cape Haytien. Such persons are not to be harbored and
                        concealed, else those harboring and concealing them shall be treated as
                        their accomplices and dealt with accordingly. Fourteen of these persons have
                        already been arrested and are now lodged in prison in this city.</p>
                    <p>Troops are still being forwarded to the north, where the President seems
                        determined to demonstrate and establish his power. Several regiments left
                        here for such destination by steamer on last Sunday morning, others had
                        preceded them the day before.</p>
                    <p>But to-day the subject which engrosses the attention of the people of all
                        classes, and which casts a gloom over the capital, filling the entire
                        community with sadness, is the intelligence, which has just arrived, that
                        the government has had executed (shot) twenty-eight of the forty men lately
                        convicted before a military commission, at St. Marc, of certain political
                        offenses. Fourteen were shot at St. Marc, and fourteen at Gonaives. Few,
                        indeed, if any persons were prepared for such action, and the people are
                        awestruck, they are filled with consternation in view of it. What the moral
                        effect of such procedure will be no one can foretell. It seems now, however,
                        that the President is determined to maintain the government, even at the
                        expense, in the manner indicated, of the lives of such rebellious subjects
                        of the country as disturb its peace and defy his authority.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 6th instant there was published in the
                        official section of Le Moniteur an address delivered by President Salomon,
                        at a public audience held by him at the Cape on Sunday, the 23d of last
                        month. A copy of this address, with a translation, is herewith inclosed and
                        transmitted to the Department.</p>
                    <p>Upon the perusal of this address, it will be perceived that the President
                        undertakes, after stating that wellnigh all the acts of his government have
                        been misinterpreted at the Cape, to explain and justify the conduct of his
                        administratisn, dwelling, as he classifies the various topics of his
                        discourse, upon his circular No. 548, dated February 18, 1882, in which he
                        advised the people to cultivate the soil; the expenses and annoyances
                        occasioned by the conduct of certain wicked persons of the Cape; the
                        non-acceptance of the bank by such persons, as advancing the financial
                        condition of the country; the men of the Cape who foolishly feel that they
                        are strong; the absurd idea of certain disloyal persons of the Cape who
                        pretend that he seeks to have himself made emperor; the high honor that has
                        been done him already, in applying to him the title of “father of the
                        country”; the pamphlet of Jacot, an infamous paper, which he characterizes
                        in severe terms of condemnation; the opinion entertained of the national
                        money by certain persons at the Cape, and finally renewed reference to his
                        circular, which is more fully explained and approved. Then, after assuring
                        the people that he has come to the Cape to tranquilize the northern part of
                        the country, and urging them to aid him in this behalf, he advises that it
                        would not be well to arouse the popular wrath by firing a shot at the Cape,
                        for no general, not even the President himself, would, in such event, should
                        he desire to do so, be able to stay the chastisement which the people would
                        inflict upon that rebellious city. Concluding, he exhorts the people to
                        assist him in his work of pacification; to be his disciples, and proclaim
                        everywhere peace, union, and concord.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Friends</hi>: When, eleven months ago, I quitted
                            the Cape at the end of a grand tour, I did not think that I would have
                            to return here so soon. After I had accomplished throughout the country
                            two grand successful tours, I felt that I had the right to remain some
                            time at Port-au-Prince occupied with the affairs of public
                            administration. But no; the Cape was opposed thereto. The Cape is a
                            center of conspiracy and disorder the Cape is a center of disturbance
                            and of anarchy.</p>
                        <p>The entire republic is tranquil; the Cape only protests against this
                            tranquility; either directly or indirectly, the Cape hinders the
                            progress of my government and is the object of all its cares.</p>
                        <p>The city of the Cape wishes to establish a state in the state; I will not
                            allow it; I <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0428"/>will not permit it.
                            Far be it from me to accuse all the people of the Cape. No; I know how
                            to separate the good grain from the tare; I would render full and entire
                            justice to the healthy part of the population, but let those who at the
                            Cape are against my government know that I cannot submit myself to their
                            will to satisfy their wishes without dishonoring myself; let them know
                            that it is my duty to compel respect for the laws and cause them to be
                            respected by all. This duty I will fulfill to the end.</p>
                        <p>Almost all the acts of my government are misinterpreted at the Cape.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">my circular.</hi></p>
                        <p>The circular which I had addressed about three months ago to my
                            commanders of arrondissements has been well accepted everywhere except
                            at the Cape; it has found at the Cape traducers. They have sought to
                            make the impression that I was treating the people as idlers in having
                            counseled them to go to cultivating the soil in order to increase their
                            revenues and establish their well-being. Well, as for me, my conviction
                            is that my circular is one of the wisest acts of my government; one of
                            those acts which honor a chief of state.</p>
                        <p>I know all those here who seek to overthrow my government. Yes, I know
                            them! Let those who feel that the cap fits them wear it.</p>
                        <p>I have come to the Cape to proceed vigorously against those who wish to
                            trouble in any and every case the public order. I shall not leave
                            without having regulated their condition; I say it loudly; it shall be
                            to my disgrace if I go hence leaving the Cape in the condition in which
                            it is found at this moment.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the outlays and annoyances occasioned
                                by the cape.</hi></p>
                        <p>My friends, I have come this time to break all horns—to chastise all
                            factionists; the men who occasion such sacrifices to the public
                            treasury.</p>
                        <p>To cite only a part of such sacrifices, understand, my friends, that the
                            two ships which have brought me and my troops here cost the state $500
                            per day. Calculate and you will see that $500 represent more than eight
                            months of salary of a general of division. And such is the unfortunate
                            state of things at the Cape, that if I had been susceptible of emotion I
                            would have been here some several weeks since, for the news which has
                            reached me has been of the most alarming sort.</p>
                        <p>The propaganda which organize themselves here have undermined credit and
                            thrown into dismay the higher branches of trade which I know to be very
                            much attached to my government, because it is believed that I am an
                            honest man.</p>
                        <p>I say misfortune to the Cape if there is fired from here a single shot.
                            Such shot would be the signal of massacre and incendiarism; and I will
                            add, for I ought to tell you the truth, my friends, it would be the
                            signal of pillage, for the entire republic is in anger against the Cape
                            and has wrathful looks towards it.</p>
                        <p>I repeat to you, my friends, I have come to do justice, and in such
                            justice I will separate the goats from the sheep, for if there are
                            evil-doers here, there are good citizens.</p>
                        <p>Do you wish to have, my friends, an idea of the injury which the
                            factionists of the Cape do us, marching in accord with the factionists
                            who are found abroad? Listen Negotiations had been commenced, abroad in
                            the interests of the state; they were interrupted at the news that the
                            Cape was going to take up arms against my government.</p>
                        <p>Work upon a railroad from Port-au-Prince to the lake had been retarded by
                            reason of the same reports; and observe, my friends, that this same
                            response was made us by all those with whom my government had commenced
                            negotiations with a view to the advancement of our country.</p>
                        <p>Is such situation acceptable, and has the time not come to finish with
                            those who have brought it about? What evil have I done, then, to these
                            evil-doers at the Cape?</p>
                        <p>The Cape has been treated by my government as a spoiled child, as a
                            preferred child. Have I not done more for the Cape than for any other
                            part of the country, than for Aux-Cayes for example? I mention Aux-Cayes
                            because it is my native city; there all my affections are found; there
                            my family and all my interests are found.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the cape and the bank.</hi></p>
                        <p>The bank, accepted by all as a source of benefit, is discredited at the
                            Cape. Why? Because the bank established order and regularity in our
                            finances; because with the bank there are no more jobs, no more thefts;
                            because it thwarts all those who were in the habit of making of the
                            public treasury their private treasury; because the bank cuts off the
                            means of living to all lazy persons who would enjoy life without labor.
                            They have permitted themselves to say that the bank has made no change
                            in the financial condition of the country. The bank has up to this time
                            furnished the funds for the various services, and more particularly for
                            that of the army which ought to be paid by privilege and by preference,
                            and the preference explains itself.</p>

                        <p>Soldiers! You who are always in requisition (an four et au moulin), as
                            they say, is it not just that you should be paid before the employés of
                            the civil order? The money has been sent here to pay you; if you have
                            not been paid for such month, it is because the money which I sent you
                            has been employed for the payment of other persons.</p>
                        <p>I ought to say, nevertheless, in extenuation of the incorrect conduct of
                            the paymaster, that nothing proves up to this time that he has diverted
                            anything to his own profit; his offense consists in having made a false
                            application of the funds which he had received. If this act is repeated
                            the employé shall be dismissed and punished. A commission now examines
                            the accounts of the paymaster.</p>
                        <p>I have the consciousness that I have done everything which was possible
                            to prevent the Cape from suffering. What has been my surprise, then, my
                            dissatisfaction on arriving here, to understand among other things that
                            there are due three payments at Fort Liberté. I have just explained to
                            you the cause of this.</p>
                        <p>Then there is nothing which I have not done to give satisfaction to the
                            Cape. I have done more still always to be agreeable to this city; I have
                            taken from its midst three of its sons to constitute my ministry,
                            composed of five members. Well, interrogate these three children of the
                            Cape; they will tell you how they are chagrined, humiliated by the
                            conduct of the Cape. (Demonstrations of approbation.)</p>
                        <p>The Cape is a black point for the republic. The Cape is an obstacle to
                            its onward march.</p>

                        <p>Once more, my friends, in speaking as I do, I only undertake to speak of
                            wicked per sons, the disturbers who are in your midst and whom you know.
                            Here there are men who believe and who say they are strong. Well, those
                            men deceive themselves; they are not strong as I, and I will prove it by
                            breaking all the horns so lofty as they may be. Yes, my friends, I say I
                            am strong because I know I am supported by you; because I know I am able
                            to count upon the valorous swords of you all, my lieutenants who stand
                            around me, of you all, my commanders of arrondissements, because I feel
                            that I am supported by the bayonets of the army and by the love of my
                            fellow-citizens.</p>
                        <p>I have preached union and concord. I have always and without ceasing
                            preached them. For that my enemies have said that my language was that
                            of fear or weakness; others even see therein nonsense. Having charge of
                            the people, I have no right to be weak; I am not vulnerable to fear. I
                            foolish? Permit me to believe that I am not.</p>
                        <p>The enemies within and without have made haste to circulate the report
                            that I had given order to General Tirésias Simon Sam to arrest certain
                            persons, and that he had refused to obey. Be convinced that a general to
                            whom I may have given order to arrest any one, will execute such order.
                            They say besides, these enemies, that I have given order to recruit and
                            that my lieutenants have refused to do so. Error again. When I shall
                            give order to recruit they will recruit.</p>

                        <p>In their propaganda the wrongdoers have said that I wish to have myself
                            proclaimed emperor. (Great sensation and movements of attention.) To
                            have myself proclaimed emperor: this would be the act of a fool or an
                            imbecile. I am neither a fool nor an imbecile!!!</p>
                        <p>At the moment when empires are crumbling, is this the moment in which I
                            would determine to have myself proclaimed emperor? No; I am not capable
                            of such folly, of such ridicule. Everything admonishes us that empires
                            have finished their terms.</p>
                        <p>If in 1848 it was an error to found an empire in Hayti, to-day this would
                            be insanity. As strong as I am as President, so weak I would be as
                            emperor. The title of emperor, far from strengthening me in the esteem
                            of my fellow-citizens, would cause me the loss of it. Named emperor
                            to-day, I would fall to-morrow.</p>
                        <p>My friends, you have already wrought for me a very much more beautiful
                            crown, much more rich than that of all the emperors of the world—a crown
                            which even very few emperors wear, so precious is it. This crown you
                            have awarded me in calling me the father of the country. (Prolonged
                            applause; cries of long live the father of the country.)</p>
                        <p>Chief of state, am I not really the father of you all? Follow well my
                            conduct and you will see that since I have been at the head of the
                            country, I only cause my presence to be felt as a father, I only cite
                            one example, and especially in response to—</p>

                            I have been obliged to publish in the Official Journal numerous
                            documents proving the contrary.</p>
                        <p>You have read them, even you. I have done more; I have gone into the

                            with my wife, to visit persons with smallpox, talking to them, seeking
                            to draw from them a smile in the midst of their sufferings, and giving
                            them aid and consolation. It was necessary to gird up ones loins to
                            remain in the midst of men in whose faces there remained nothing human,
                            and nevertheless I did it, and I did it with pleasure, because I felt
                            myself rather the father than the chief of my fellow-citizens. What
                            chief of state in Hayti has done that which I have done in this

                        <p>Such are the infamous things which they dare to publish against me. So I

                        <p>What I have done is not for me, nor for fame, for I have enough glory of

                        <p>I am old; you are young. I myself go; you yourselves remain. It is for
                            you who remain that I consent to be at your head, laboring to escape the
                            misfortunes which the enemies would call upon the fatherland. Yes, it is
                            for you that I have made the sacrifice upon the altar of the fatherland
                            of all hatred, of all ill-will; it is for you, and by love for you, that
                            I consent to forget all that I suffered during twenty years of exile; to
                            preoccupy myself only with the progress of the country, and with the

                        <p>Another perfidy. I have given money to the country. It is the best
                            national money we have yet had in Hayti, or rather it is thereof the
                            only good. On one side of this money the arms of the republic are found,
                            on the other the head of a female. Would one believe that the idle of
                            the Cape, the jobbers and agitators of this city, are taking advantage
                            of this portrait to create a propaganda against my government? They say
                            that I have put upon one side the portrait of my wife, who is white,
                            which signifies that I wish to sell the country to the whites.

                            to me, nothing is better for a Haytien woman than the handkerchief.

                            why coffee has fallen to so low price—many of the countries which had
                            not been producers thereof, produce it to-day, in abundance; and the
                            more merchandise abounds in the market, the less one demands it, and the
                            less one finds purchasers. On the other side, according as the
                            production of coffee is increased abroad, they invent machines for its
                            preparation; hence, not only do these countries produce more coffee than
                            we, but, besides, their coffee is better prepared than ours.</p>
                        <p>These causes are the only ones which operate to depreciate our coffee
                            abroad. To improve its price I have striven to give you advice; I have
                            told you our fortune lies in the earth; that nine merchants out of ten
                            fail, although they never fail who work the soil. I was not content with
                            these counsels alone; I offered the example of working myself the soil.
                            It is, besides, my trade. At Kingston during my exile, I only did this,
                            and I did well thereby. Well, they have said here that it is because of
                            contempt for you that I have advised you to work the soil. Ah! it is
                            necessary that I chastise these wicked persons of the Cape.</p>
                        <p>But to resume, my friends, I will tell you that 1 have come here to
                            reassure the country; to reassure the inhabitants and the honorable
                            fathers of family of the Cape. I have come to reassure those who possess
                            as well as those who do not possess, but who wish to work honestly to
                            make for themselves a position. I have come to reassure the commerce,
                            the higher branches of trade especially—that is to say, that part of the
                            commerce composed of men who have left native country, family, to come
                            to establish themselves in Hayti. I have come here to reassure the
                            world, and permit me to say, that I am persuaded that you will all aid
                            me to attain this end. (Yes, yes!!)</p>
                        <p>Ah, let us avoid, yes, let us see to it that not a shot is fired at the
                            Cape. Blood which flows from the explosion of powder is a drink very
                            intoxicating. When one has commenced to drink it he experiences a
                            devouring thirst. If, then, a gun is fired at the Cape I shall be
                            impotent to stay the evil. In attempting to stay it, I would die,
                            perhaps, even myself; I tell you this from experience.</p>
                        <p>My father was the most popular man of his department. A government to
                            have been unjust towards him, to have exiled him, had not been slow to
                            recognize this popularity.</p>
                        <p>At the voice of my father, in 1483, all the department of the south was
                            on foot and in <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0431"/>arms in less
                            than eight days. Well, when I had seen in 1844 and in 1848 those men who
                            obeyed as by enchantment the voice of my father, both he and I feared
                            them, for those men were in anger, and a moment had arrived in which we
                            would have been crushed by them if we had counseled them moderation. Let
                            us then be careful not to provoke the anger of the people.</p>
                        <p>When I speak our enemies say that these are menaces for the purpose of
                            causing fear. Nevertheless, that which I say is not to intimidate but to
                            admonish; I know the history of my country.</p>
                        <p>You, General Joseph Edward, do you not know that they were angry with you
                            for not having, when you occupied in military manner the Cape in 1879,
                            permitted the sacking of the city? (Demonstrations of approval.)</p>
                        <p>At the present time, if a gun is fired at the Cape, no general, whoever
                            he may be, and even the President of Hayti, will not be sufficiently
                            powerful to make opposition to the chastisement they would seek to
                            inflict upon the rebellious city. All those who would attempt to make
                            opposition thereto would-be very quickly whitened. (Great hilarity.)</p>
                        <p>You all, my friends, who are of the conservative party—you all fathers of
                            family; you especially who have interests at the Cape, and who wish to
                            preserve them, be my apostles. There are some deaf, but perhaps they
                            will be able finally through you to hear.</p>
                        <p>My friends, I pray you thereof, I conjure you, I adjure you, aid me in
                            the work of pacification which I have pursued since my advent to power.
                            Be my disciples, preach to all, and especially, peace, union, and
                            concord. (Repeated vivats, numerous cries, of “Long live the President
                            of Hayti.”)</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, as herewith
                        inclosed, a statement with translation, as published in the official section
                        of Le Moniteur of the 13th instant, with respect to the execution of
                        twenty-eight persons, among others, tried, condemned, and sentenced to the
                        punishment of death by a special military council sitting at St. Marc, on
                        the 15th of April last; whose proceedings in the premises were sustained by
                        sentence of the council of revision of the department of the Artibonite, on
                        the 29th of April, 1882.</p>
                    <p>No official statment other than this as regards this affair has as yet been
                        published. It is reported, as matter of rumor, that very soon the government
                        will make a full and explicit account, covering the facts and law in the
                        case, which will justify its entire action. Such account is awaited with no
                        little anxiety by a very considerable proportion of the Haytien people, who
                        recollect that the twenty-fourth article of the first title of the
                        constitution of 1879, under which General Salomon was made President,
                        declares that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The punishment of death shall be restricted to certain cases which
                                the law shall determine. As to political affairs, it is abolished
                                and replaced by perpetual detention in prison.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>As regards the number of persons executed, and the circumstances of their
                        execution, this affair exceeds by far anything of the kind recorded in
                        Haytien history. On the 3d of September, 1860, there was an execution of
                        sixteen persons who had been charged and convicted of the assassination of
                        the daughter of President Geffrard and of attempts to overthow the
                        government. Here, however, are twenty-eight persons executed, fourteen in
                        one place and fourteen in another, as charged and convicted before a
                        military commission of an attempt to overthrow the <pb n="360"
                            xml:id="pg_360" facs="0432"/>government, under a constitution, which
                        prohibits the punishment of death for political offenses.</p>
                    <p>Among those executed at St. Marc, on the 5th instant, is Charles Duquéné
                        Fournier, with respect to whose citizenship I had the honor to address the
                        Department, in my despatch No. 439, dated February 23, 1882.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor, by my dispatch No. 456 of the
                        15th of last month, to advise you of the departure of President Salomon for
                        Cape Haytien. I have the honor, now, to announce his return to
                        Port-au-Prince, after an absence of thirty odd days, during which time he
                        has been as far northward as Monte Christe, where the Dominican local
                        authorities are said to have paid him their cordial respects.</p>
                    <p>The principal part of this time, however, he spent in the Cape investigating,
                        with the local authorities of the place, the revolutionary condition <pb
                            n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0433"/>of that city and neighboring
                        region. The result of such investigation seems to have been the placing of
                        the Cape, Fort-Liberté, and Trou, under martial law, according to the act of
                        the 13th April, 1880, which confers the authority, in that behalf, upon the
                        President of the republic in case of civil troubles or imminent invasion by
                        a foreign power, and the order of arrest of forty-two persons charged with
                        complicity in the civil troubles existing in that section of the country,
                        and who, under the act referred to, if arrested, are to be tried by military
                        commission like that recently sitting at St. Marc.</p>
                    <p>Of the forty two persons whose arrest the government at present seeks,
                        twenty-nine have been already taken and put in prison in this city. Fifteen
                        of them were brought by the President on his return.</p>
                    <p>The President arrived at the capital at 7 o’clock on the morning of the 18th
                        instant. His reception was cordial and enthusiastic; the army and National
                        Guard being represented in large numbers; and the people, though the hour
                        was early, making their appearance in thousands and behaving themselves in
                        most seemly manner. The debarkation of the President, his march to and

                        my dispatch yesterday, No. 467, in which I refer among other things, in
                        dwelling upon the President’s return to the capital, to his having delivered
                        a brief address at the National Palace, such address has appeared in L’Œil
                        of this date. This journal is semi-official, and in its political character
                        and relations a stanch and reliable representative of the
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>As being the very last utterance of the chief executive, embodying his views
                        with regard to the present condition of affairs in the department of the
                        Artibonite, the north, and the northwest, his purposes and plans for the
                        future in dealing with those who disturb the public peace, as well as his
                        opinion of those persons who, having learned, it may be incorrectly, of his
                        determination and order to arrest some two hundred men and one hundred and
                        fifty women in Port-au-Prince, have left the <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362"
                            facs="0434"/>country within a few days to seek protection in foreign
                        countries, I have the honor to transmit, as herewith inclosed, and as
                        published in the L’Œil of to-day, the President’s address, with
                        translation.</p>
                    <p>It will be perceived that the extreme sentiments of this address, like those
                        of the two discourses delivered at the Cape, seem to have been received with
                        the most cordial applause. It may not be amiss, in this connection, to state
                        that of the forty men condemned at St. Marc by military commission twelve
                        are as yet undisposed of. In a brief editorial article L’Œil of this day
                        explains why these persons have not been executed, quoting, in support of
                        its statement in this regard, the terrible words, as it characterizes them,
                        employed by the President himself on last Tuesday at St. Marc. For some time
                        past, in fact for the last three years, pamphlets written and published by
                        persons hostile to the present government, in exile at Kingston, Jamaica, or
                        St. Thomas, containing treasonable sentiments, violent criticisms of the
                        government, and aspersions of its personnel, tending to bring it into
                        contempt and to destroy its authority, have been sent from the places named
                        and put in circulation in this country. Such a pamphlet is that of Jacot,
                        mentioned specially by the President in his second discourse at the
                        Cape.</p>
                    <p>L’Œil states, as translated, that “each pamphlet sent into Hayti will provoke
                        the execution of one of those condemned to death by the special military
                        council of St. Marc”; and adds that the “advertisement is positive.”</p>
                    <p>These men seem, then, to be held in pledge as hostages for the good behavior,
                        in the respect indicated, of persons in exile, who have heretofore occupied
                        themselves in writing against the government.</p>
                    <p>While it is true that the President does not refer in terms, in his speech
                        herewith transmitted, to this particular topic, its general scope and drift
                        would seem to cover it. He says he has been pressed to extreme measures, and
                        since he has commenced he will continue.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Friends</hi>: I have only a few words to say to
                            you. The tour which I have just made in the department of the
                            Artibonite, the north, and the northwest has been very fortunate and has
                            produced very good results.</p>
                        <p>I speak to you to-day with the most profound conviction that the City of
                            the Cape will cease henceforth to be the object of all the efforts of my
                            government. I have established order everywhere, and I have left
                            everything in good order. I answer now for peace throughout the entire
                            republic.</p>
                        <p>I have been pushed to extreme measures. Well, since I have commenced I
                            will continue. (Prolonged applause. Numerous cries of “Long live the
                            President of the republic. Long live the father of the country.”)</p>
                        <p>Peace is necessary for us, cost what it may. It is necessary for us, my
                            friends, because it works the good of the people. (Prolonged
                            hurrahs.)</p>
                        <p>On reaching St. Marc I learned that several persons had escaped from the
                            capital under pretext that they would be arrested. I find that these
                            persons did wrong to go abroad, or rather if they have gone it is
                            because they are sensible of their guilt.</p>
                        <p>It is said that I return to the capital with the purpose to arrest two
                            hundred men and one hundred and fifty women. I need not tell you that
                            there is nothing of the sort, my friends. A conspiracy having been
                            discovered, justice institutes inquiry, and investigation will follow
                            its course.</p>
                        <p>My government will do everything by the law and with the law. Only, for
                            certain of our fellow-citizens, it is necessary to hold the balance with
                            a firm hand. But I <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0435"/>promise yon,
                            my friends, that all the acts of my government shall be based upon the
                            law, and nothing shall be done without it. (Renewed hurrahs.)</p>
                        <p>It is useless to tell you what I have done during my tour; you have
                            already read the accounts of my voyage as well as my last
                            discourses.</p>
                        <p>I am truly happy to find the capital again in perfect tranquillity. I
                            thank very sincerely all my fellow-citizens who have contributed so
                            resolutely to the maintenance of the public peace. (Numerous cries of
                            “Long live the father of the country.”)</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, as herewith
                        inclosed, published in the official section of Le Moniteur of the 6th
                        instant, a circular, with translation, addressed by the honorable secretary
                        of state of justice, Mr. Madiou, to the commissaries of the government of
                        the civil tribunals of this republic, dated June 24, 1882, concerning the
                        frequent reclamations lately presented by ministers and consuls of foreign
                        powers accredited near the Haytien Government, on behalf of foreigners
                        located in various parts of this country, who have been subjected to
                        maltreatment. Being desirous of avoiding all such reclamations, the
                        government asks that in case of strife between Haytiens and foreigners, and
                        in case of offenses committed by foreigners, the officers addressed dealing
                        therewith shall observe every precaution and shall comply strictly with the
                        law. It is said by Mr. Madiou that in case of arrest no insulting word, no
                        threat, no brutality should be employed; that the law should be the guide of
                        the officer invariably; and in cases not requiring prompt action, nothing
                        should be done till after the superior authority has been consulted. The
                        provisions of this circular are to be observed by the judges of the peace,
                        by all agents under their control, and by all having to do with the judical
                        police.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this circular is good; and in view of recent occurrences of
                        the character indicated, brought to the attention of the government,
                        considered and adjusted by it, in some instances by the payment of
                        considerable indemnity, its publication would seem to be necessary.</p>
                    <p>It is only within a few days that a commissary at St. Marc committed a most
                        intolerable outrage upon a British subject, the settlement of which cost the
                        government $500. In this case, for some reason or other, as report gives it,
                        the person maltreated was invited into the office of the commissary, where
                        he was insulted, and when he would leave was ordered to remain, and when he
                        persisted in going was ordered under arrest, and in rough and brutal manner
                        was finally hurried off to prison, where he was detained for five days
                        without charge of any sort being made against him. It would seem that this
                        proceeding was had simply to gratify the bad feeling and designs of the
                        commissary, whom the government at once dismissed in utter disgrace and had
                        imprisoned.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter of gratification that not many such occurrences have taken
                        place in connection with American citizens residing in this country during
                        the past four or five years.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 31st of December last their Majesties
                        the King and Queen of Italy gave to the diplomatic corps at this capital a
                        formal reception in the mode prescribed by the new ceremonial for the New
                        Year’s festivities. In the reign of Victor Emanuel, and before the creation
                        of a corps of ambassadors at Rome, the chiefs of mission were received
                        individually in audience, first by His Majesty and then by the crown prince
                        and princess, the latter being attended by the ladies of her court; and on a
                        subsequent day the secretaries of legation and the ladies of the diplomatic
                        corps were all received at the same time by the crown prince and princess.
                        By the present regulations, all the members of the diplomatic corps, of
                        whatever rank, of both sexes, are received together by the King and Queen,
                        who pass around the circle in opposite directions, each addressing a few
                        words of compliment to all the chiefs of missions, the King conversing more
                        or less with all the members of the corps.</p>
                    <p>The Emperor Napoleon III was in the habit of availing himself of these
                        occasions for alluding to threatened or desired political events, and for
                        hinting at the probable policy of France in respect to them. An expectation
                        had been excited that the King of Italy, in imitation of the Emperor of the
                        French, would take this opportunity to make some disclosures in regard to
                        the possible results of the late visit of their Majesties at the court of
                        Vienna, and to the relations between Italy on <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365"
                            facs="0437"/>the one hand and the German Empire and the Papacy on the
                        other. These expectations were disappointed. His Majesty was silent on these
                        subjects, and as no official declarations of any importance have been made
                        in reference to these questions, the public anxiety in regard to them has
                        greatly increased.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The difficulties between France and the other European as well as Mussulman
                        states augment the chances of collision, and in my long political experience
                        I have seen no crisis in the public affairs of Europe which seemed to me to
                        threaten more serious evils to the cause of modern civilization than the
                        complications which present themselves at the beginning of the present
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Although American courts may perhaps in some circumstances take notice <hi
                            rend="italic">ex officio</hi> that there are elsewhere institutions
                        claiming, by prescription or otherwise, the right to exist and to discharge
                        important functions independently of legislative authority, yet, as
                        according to-our generally accepted elementary law, no such bodies can
                        permanently exist on our soil except as creatures of the state and as in all
                        things subject to its control, we are at present exempt from those conflicts
                        of jurisdiction which have so often, in European countries, shaken organized
                        society to its very foundations. But like claims may, possibly, at some
                        future day be advanced among us and with similar results. However that may
                        be, the rapid extension of our commerce and of our political influence
                        cannot fail to bring us in contact with conflicting interests, and our
                        foreign relations will hereafter demand a much larger share of the attention
                        of the Federal Government than they have hitherto done. We are not, indeed,
                        necessarily involved in the complications which are now threatening the
                        peace of the Old World, yet it will be very difficult in practice to avoid
                        entanglements more or less serious, though it is to be hoped that the vastly
                        greater interests of our internal commerce, industry, and government may not
                        be sacrificed to considerations connected with our foreign policy.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At the reopening of the Italian Parliament
                        after the New Year’s holidays, the expected inquiries into the state of the
                        foreign relations of Italy were made by General Ricotti and replied to by
                        Mr. Mancini. In the mean time the public excitement had partially subsided,
                        or rather been calmed,* * * and the parliamentary debate on the subject was
                        neither general nor animated. So far as the actual condition of the
                        international relations of the parties were concerned no new disclosures
                        were elicited. The attention of the Italian public is easily diverted* * *
                        and a recent transaction in the journalistic world, avowedly a mere banker’s
                        speculation, but which is suspected to have, and perhaps actually has, a
                        real political significance, engrosses public attention to the exclusion of
                        topics certainly important. An Austrian subject by birth, but naturalized in
                        Italy, has lately purchased a controlling interest <pb n="366"
                            xml:id="pg_366" facs="0438"/>in five or six of the principal journals of
                        Rome, including the Diritto, the most important semi-official organ of the
                        administration, Many believe that the purchase was made in behalf of the
                        French Government with the view of influencing public sentiment in Italy
                        towards France; but as the principal writers in the columns of these papers
                        have withdrawn from their editorial corps and established new journals, the
                        movement is likely to prove a financial if not a political failure. At the
                        same time a good deal of alarm is excited by the general monetary crisis
                        throughout the continent, though the public funds of Italy have suffered
                        less depression than those of most other countries. Still it will probably
                        interfere with the resumption of specie payment in Italy, which was making
                        good progress, though not yet legally accomplished.</p>
                    <p>To these causes of anxiety must be added, besides those alluded to in my
                        dispatch No. 1015, the overthrow of the Gambetta cabinet in France, the
                        revolt in the Christian provinces of Turkey occupied by Austria under the
                        treaty of Berlin, the threatened collision between Great Britain and Spain
                        in the Island of Borneo, and disquieting circumstances in other parts of the
                        Old World. Some of these difficulties at hand, it is greatly to be feared,
                        will not be settled without resort to hostilities, the extent of which
                        cannot be foreseen; and I must repeat what I said in my dispatch 1015, that
                        in my long experience of public affairs I have never seen the political
                        horizon of Europe in so disturbed and so menacing a state.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have forwarded to the Department of State
                        several copies, in newspaper and pamphlet form, of the remarkable financial
                        exposition recently made to the Italian Parliament by the minister,
                        Magliani. It is a document of uncommon ability, and presents an unexpectedly
                        encouraging view of the condition of the national finances, and of the
                        success with which they have been administered during the past year.</p>
                    <p>Whether the anticipations of the minister will be realized to their full
                        extent is, at the least, doubtful.</p>
                    <p>The journals of the opposition are already predicting that, though large
                        loans have been negotiated for the purpose of facilitating the resumption of
                        specie payment, the measure will not really be effected during the present
                        year. It is easy to imagine that a failure of the crops for the coming
                        season may occasion serious embarrassments, which may be augmented by
                        foreign financial measures or political complications. These, however, are
                        not matters of calculation; but though the efforts of European governments
                        have succeeded, for the present, in allaying many threatening symptoms of
                        popular disquiet, yet the causes of this disquiet still subsist, and it may
                        at any minute burst into violent eruption. The immediate danger to Italian
                        finances is that Parliament may be compelled by local influences to commit
                        itself to enterprises in the way of internal and municipal improvements
                        which, if not altogether <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0439"/>visionary,
                        do not promise to be, at least at present, remunerative. Add to this the
                        enormous expenditure which is already more or less urgently demanded in
                        military circles for the purpose of national defense, and it will be seen
                        that the Italian exchequer may be soon subjected to drafts beyond its
                        capacity to meet.</p>
                    <p>The whole northern land-frontier bordering on the dominions of Austria,
                        Switzerland, and France is to a great extent undefended, the powerful works
                        of the old frontier having been rendered useless by recent changes of
                        boundary which may require the construction of costly fortifications at
                        points corresponding to those of the famous <hi rend="italic"
                            >Quadrilateral</hi>, formerly so celebrated in European warfare. The
                        coast line of Italy, which, including the shores of Sicily and Sardinia, is
                        of very great extent, is at present rendered partially secure rather by the
                        want of harbors of sufficient depth of water for the powerful vessels
                        recently constructed and now constructing by almost every government in
                        Europe than by defensive works capable of contending against such means of
                        attack. In the opinion of able engineers expensive constructions ought to be
                        at once commenced and new lines of railway planned with special reference to
                        military communication, and public sentiment seems to demand that the
                        general policy of the government should be subordinated to considerations of
                        military efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The abolition of the odious and impolitic <hi rend="italic">grist tax</hi>
                        must operate as a considerable relief to the laboring classes, and the
                        surrender of the equally obnoxious government monopoly of salt is earnestly
                        demanded by able and influential statesmen, both on economic and sanitary
                        grounds. Socialistic and other disorganizing opinions do not at present wear
                        a threatening aspect in Italy, but the disparity in the physical condition
                        of the productive and the unproductive classes is becoming too great to be
                        submitted to much longer without violent attempt at reform.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The present administration* * * has on the whole been conducted with
                        remarkable ability and success, and it has acquired a hold upon public
                        confidence which will not easily be shaken.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The commercial treaty between Italy and
                        France, recently negotiated by the diplomatic representatives of those
                        countries, has been submitted to the two houses of the Italian Parliament,
                        and, after discussion, has been finally approved. I have refrained from
                        making it the subject of a dispatch because it has not yet been officially
                        promulgated or otherwise made public in any authentic form. I shall send
                        copies of this treaty to the State Department as soon as it issues from the
                        press. Its * * * approval was pressed by the ministry partly for political
                        reasons as well as on economical grounds, and its approval will doubtless
                        have a beneficial effect on the mutual relations between the two
                        countries.</p>
                    <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0440"/>
                    <p>It has at least one advantage over the treaty of 1863, in having been
                        thoroughly examined and publicly discussed, which can hardly be said of the
                        former. The treaty of 1863 was scarcely discussed at all.</p>
                    <p>Of course I am not yet prepared to speak of the bearing of the provisions of
                        the new treaty upon the commercial or the industrial interests of Italy, but
                        I have no reason to suppose that any of them are of a character injuriously
                        to affect the fair competition of American producers, whether agricultural
                        or industrial.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary movements in
                        Egypt and in other northern provinces of Africa, which are every day
                        assuming a new aspect and threaten to jeopardize the large Italian interests
                        in those countries, are exciting much anxious feeling.* * * At any rate,
                        many of the questions involved in the recent international action of the
                        countries bordering upon the Mediterranean will soon imperiously demand a
                        solution.* * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By yesterday’s post I forwarded to the State
                        Department copies of four of the leading daily journals of Rome containing
                        obituary notices of General Giuseppe Garibaldi, who died at his residence on
                        the island of Caprera on the evening of the 2d of June.</p>
                    <p>General Garibaldi had for many years been a great sufferer from chronic
                        rheumatism and other complaints, but I am not aware that there was any
                        sensible decay in his mental powers until the near approach of the final
                        catastrophe. This was probably hastened by the fatigue and excitement
                        attendant on his visit to Palermo on the anniversary of the celebrated <hi
                            rend="italic">Sicilian Vespers</hi>, where it was feared that his
                        presence might tend rather to inflame than to allay the actual natural
                        irritation both against France and against the Church, which historic
                        recollections and recent events have combined so strongly to aggravate. But
                        either prudential considerations (of which Garibaldi, with all his
                        enthusiasm of character, has seldom lost sight) or the languor of mortal
                        disease restrained him from any such expressions of his known opinions and
                        feelings towards the Tuileries and the Vatican as could give just cause of
                        offence to the incumbents of high positions in either of those quarters.</p>
                    <p>The obituary details in the Italian journals contain many interesting facts
                        in regard to the career of this remarkable man, but there is a certain
                        reticence observable in most of them with reference to some events which the
                        mystery that in spite of their recent date still hangs over them, renders
                        Italian publicists shy of approaching.* * *</p>
                    <p>The last few years of Garibaldi’s life were passed in retirement and
                        comparative quiet. He did not exercise nor even attempt to exercise any
                        partisan influence in the affairs of Italy. But to the beginning of this
                        period of repose, when he had not yet ceased to be a <hi rend="italic"
                            >power</hi> in Europe, belongs one of the grandest, perhaps <hi
                            rend="italic">the</hi> grandest and most significant act of his life.
                        Though repeatedly elected to the House of Deputies in <pb n="369"
                            xml:id="pg_369" facs="0441"/>the Italian Parliament, he first took his
                        seat in Rome in 1876. At this period the political institutions of Italy,
                        though they had apparently received their definite form, had not got
                        completely into working order, nor had their action become so thoroughly a
                        part of the common consciousness of the more or less discordant
                        jurisdictions which had united to form a legal body politic, as to exclude
                        all danger from disturbing influences. The Church was still avowedly hostile
                        to the new political state; the attitude of the European governments in
                        general towards it was as yet uncertain. Garibaldi, “who had never fully
                        received the support or the confidence of the Italian aristocracy, though
                        enjoying the most unbounded popularity among all other classes of his
                        countrymen” was known to be exposed to influences not altogether friendly to
                        the actual Government of Italy at that moment. His attitude, therefore,
                        towards the new kingdom, as finally established at Rome (which city when he
                        was last within its walls he was desperately defending as a republic against
                        Napoleonic France) was a matter of extreme solicitude. It was not known
                        whether he would take his seat in Parliament under the obligation imposed by
                        the official oath required of deputies, and there was reason to fear that
                        his refusal to do so would be the signal for the outburst of a new
                        revolution whose extent and effects it was quite impossible to foresee.
                        When, therefore, in the presence of the royal family and court, the
                        assembled Parliament, and a vast multitude of spectators, he arose in his
                        seat and by the word “<hi rend="italic">giuro</hi>” pronounced his adhesion
                        to the obligation implied by the oath recited to him by the proper officer,
                        the sense of relief from an impending danger was manifested by a burst of
                        applause from the excited audience, which was echoed and re-echoed by the
                        expectant crowds that thronged the avenues to the Parliament-house and the
                        adjacent streets. From that moment it was felt that Italy was not only<hi
                            rend="italic">free</hi> but <hi rend="italic">safe.</hi></p>
                    <p>Many times, however, both before and since that eventful day, the zealous
                        patriotism and ardent philanthropy of Garibaldi have led him, not only in
                        his private but also in his public utterances, to manifest a natural
                        impatience with the government that old abuses were so slowly done away
                        with, and that the moral and physical condition of the poorer class was not
                        more rapidly improved. But all these outbursts of dissatisfaction have been
                        set down both by prince and people to their true source, an enthusiastic
                        love of his country and of humanity, and all classes alike, from the throne
                        to the humblest peasant, are now rivaling each other in doing honor to the
                        memory of one of the most extraordinary men that have appeared in any age or
                        in any country. All Italy has assumed the badge of mourning; the King has
                        expressed in strong terms sympathy with the bereaved family and with the
                        kingdom on their great his loss; Parliament has voted a pension to each of
                        his children and decreed a national monument in his memory; every large town
                        is preparing to erect memorial statues, or taking other steps to do him
                        honor, and every village and hamlet is manifesting its respect and affection
                        according to its ability to do so. Garibaldi’s political life was so closely
                        associated with the history of the reign of Napoleon III that it can hardly
                        be judged of by this generation or by the succeeding one. * * * The private
                        life, the personal adventures, and the military career of Giuseppe Garibaldi
                        will, in the mean time, form an important constituent in the legendary
                        history of our country, and the rare personal qualities which characterize
                        him as a true soldier, but which the military pedantry of the schools have
                        denied to him, will be universally acknowledged by posterity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By this post I forward to the Department of
                        State the Diritto of this date, containing in its leading article a detailed
                        statement of the number and organization of the military force of Italy now
                        actually under arms or. which may be called into service in time of any
                        probable emergency. These troops are all provided with the most improved
                        arms used in modern warfare and otherwise thoroughly equipped for active
                        duty. The discipline of the Italian army is not merely strict, but severe,*
                        * * and I have no doubt that men thus trained will form a very effective
                        soldiery, though I believe the social and moral discipline which is imparted
                        to American youth, combined with a more elastic organization, and with
                        greater freedom of individual action, will make an American army superior to
                        any troops formed under the Italian or any other European system.</p>
                    <p>The expense of equipping and maintaining so large a military force is greatly
                        disproportioned to the resources of Italy, and though the finances of the
                        country have improved in condition under the present administration, yet a
                        few years or even months of actual war would, as I believe, require the
                        imposition of new burdens upon the Italian people.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The naval department, too, has involved a corresponding expenditure, and
                        still larger appropriations are demanded for both the military and naval
                        branches of the public service.</p>
                    <p>There are symptoms of discontent among the laboring classes in Lombardy and
                        elsewhere, which though not extensive enough to threaten any immediate
                        danger, yet point to the existence of a popular feeling that,* * * may well
                        excite serious apprehensions as to the political future of Italy. Perhaps
                        the greatest safeguard against revolt and revolution in Italy is to be found
                        in the confidence so generally felt throughout the kingdom in the House of
                        Savoy under its present wise and truly patriotic heads.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The present promising appearance of the principal crops throughout Italy is
                        doing something to encourage and appease the classes that suffer most
                        severely from public burdens, but the poverty of these classes is such that
                        but for the vague hope of some great change for the better it could scarcely
                        be endured.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your telegram, announcing the sudden death of
                        Mr. Marsh, has been received, and has been communicated to the
                        President.</p>
                    <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0443"/>
                    <p>I have this day sent a message by cable, desiring you to convey to Mrs. Marsh
                        the sympathy felt by the President, and by myself, with her in this
                        bereavement.</p>
                    <p>The Italian minister at this capital has, by direction of his government,
                        presented to the President the expressions of sorrow felt by the King of
                        Italy at the death of that eminent author and diplomatist, whose merits are
                        so highly appreciated wherever he was known.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Marsh entered the diplomatic service in May, 1849, when he was
                        commissioned as minister resident to Turkey, where he remained until
                        1853.</p>
                    <p>In March, 1861, he was commissioned envoy extraordinary and minister
                        plenipotentiary to Turin, whence he followed the government to Florence and
                        Rome, and has occupied the post with credit to himself and his country for
                        over twenty-one years.</p>
                    <p>To the country, and especially to this Department, the death of an officer of
                        such large experience, and of such varied and high attainments, is a loss
                        not to be repaired.</p>
                    <p>It may be some consolation to Mrs. Marsh in her deep affliction to feel that
                        her sorrow is shared by all who had the good fortune to know Mr. Marsh, or
                        who had official relations with him, and that she has the deep sympathy of
                        her fellow-citizens who admired and respected Mr. Marsh not only for his
                        scholarly attainments, but also as an exemplary citizen, and a faithful and
                        able public servant.</p>
                    <p>I have to request you to renew to Mrs. Marsh the assurance of the deep
                        sympathy which the President and I feel for her in her affliction.</p>
                    <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My telegram of the 24th instant informed you
                        of the decease of Mr. Marsh, which took place at Vallombrosa, Tuscany, not
                        on the morning of that day, as I was led to suppose by my first intimation
                        of it, but on the evening previous. He died very suddenly of paralysis of
                        the heart, without any premonitory symptoms and without suffering, his
                        health being as usual up to a half hour of the event.</p>
                    <p>There being no telegraphic station in that out-of-the-way place, high up in
                        the mountains, dispatches could be sent only the next day, and the earliest
                        news of the sad event was communicated to me by the ministry of foreign
                        affairs, which had its information from the Royal Institute of Forestry, and
                        established in the former monastery of Vallombrosa.</p>
                    <p>I left at once to join Mrs. Marsh, both as a friend and the person indicated
                        to provide for the interment befitting the rank of the deceased. On my
                        arrival there I found that great difficulties had had to be overcome in the
                        arrangement for the last offices to the dead, on account of the laws of
                        Italy on the subject, but thanks to the energy and firmness of Signore
                        Simone Peruzzi, an officer of the royal court, living near by, who assumed
                        the responsibility of infringing upon the regulations, impossible <pb
                            n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0444"/>to comply with there. These
                        obstacles were surmounted, and I am happy to inform you that every mark of
                        respect, and every honor due to the deceased as a distinguished man, and the
                        representative of a friendly nation, were shown by the authorities of tbe
                        Italian Government.</p>
                    <p>The remains were conveyed to Rome under my charge on the 28th, and on
                        reaching the railway station were met by the diplomatic corps, the minister,
                        director-general and secretary-general of foreign affairs, the
                        director-general of the ministry of the interior, representing the prime
                        minister, the syndic and a deputation from, the municipality of Rome,
                        delegates from the provincial council, a representation of the royal
                        household, the consul-general and vice-consul-general of the United States,
                        and a number of Americans and friends of the family. A regiment of lancers
                        was in attendance, and a squadron of it led and a battalion closed the
                        procession to the cemetery at the opposite side of the city, where the body
                        will remain in a mortuary chamber until the end of September, by which time
                        the family will be able to return to Rome, and there will be some American
                        Protestant clergyman present to perform the religious ceremony of the
                        funeral.</p>
                    <p>I have returned thanks verbally to the officials of the Italian Government
                        for the attentions shown upon this melancholy occasion, and have written a
                        formal note of thanks to the minister of foreign affairs, and called in
                        person to express to the syndic of Rome my appreciation of the honors
                        rendered; and I would indicate as deserving of special thanks his excellency
                        Signore Mancini, minister, of foreign affairs; the Signore Malvano,
                        director-general of foreign, affairs Signore Simone Peruzzi, master of
                        ceremonies: the delegate from the prefecture of Florence, the commander of
                        carabineers, of Pontassieve (these two last named, having been ordered to
                        Vallombrosa to be at Mrs. Marsh’s and my disposition, rendered most
                        efficient services); the directors of the Royal Institute of Forestry, the
                        syndics of Rome, Pontassieve, and Reggello.</p>
                    <p>All the principal journals of Italy have published highly eulogistic obituary
                        articles on Mr. Marsh and his distinguished career, and expressions of
                        condolence have been very general. The King and Queen both telegraphed to
                        Mrs. Marsh their participation in her sorrow, the telegram of his Majesty
                        expressing with much feeling his sympathy for her and his high appreciation
                        of the eminent character of the late minister of the United States, who for
                        twenty-one years shed luster upon his court.</p>

                            Document No. 74, page 124.</note> to take effect on the 31st <pb n="373"
                            xml:id="pg_373" facs="0445"/>instant, issued by Her Britannic Majesty,
                        by and with the advice of Her Majesty’s privy council, as published in the
                        Japan Daily Mail of the 19th and 21st instant, together with the official
                        notification of Her Majesty’s consulate in Yokohama, as published in the
                        issue of the same paper of the 21st instant.</p>
                    <p>I beg leave to say that reference to this order will show that the order in
                        council for 1865, issued by Her Majesty for Japan and China, remains in full
                        force save as modified in the order for 1881. I had the honor to transmit to
                        the Department with my No. 229 a copy of the order of 1865.</p>
                    <p>The order last named, as I have heretofore suggested to the Department,
                        provides that a jury in Her Majesty’s courts in China and Japan for the
                        trial of civil and criminal cases shall consist of five persons, and I beg
                        leave to add that this provision remains in force under the order for
                        1881.</p>
                    <p>Permit me further to remark, that sections 101, 102, and 103 of the order of
                        1865 remain in full force, which several sections restrict the Jurisdiction
                        of Her Majesty’s courts in Japan and China in criminal cases for crimes
                        committed by British subjects on shipboard to such crimes as said subjects
                        may commit within one hundred miles of the coasts of China or Japan and
                        within any British vessel or Chinese or Japanese vessel or “within a vessel
                        not lawfully entitled to claim the protection of the flag of any state.”</p>
                    <p>In this connection I respectfully ask your attention to my No. 1228, dated
                        the 22d December, 1880, in relation to the British claim of exclusive
                        jurisdiction over John M. Ross, an American seaman, for a crime committed by
                        him within the American merchant vessel Bullion, on the person of an officer
                        and in violation of American law, when said vessel was within the
                        territorial waters of Japan.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me important that I should especially note that this order for
                        1881, sections 9–20, provides that in China and Japan Her Majesty’s
                        respective ministers therein may join therein ministers of any foreign
                        powers in amity with Her Majesty in making or adopting regulations with like
                        objects as those described in the schedule of the order of 1881. A reference
                        to the schedule appended to this order shows that the regulations thus
                        provided for by joint action are land regulations; regulations and by-laws
                        annexed thereto; regulations for the foreign settlements in China and Japan;
                        and port, consular, and harbor regulations.</p>
                    <p>It really seems to me that this new device for joint regulations by virtue of
                        co operation ought not to receive favor from our government. This provision
                        is similar in character to the proposition made last year by the British
                        consul at Nagasaki, which I communicated, with my views thereon, to your
                        honorable predecessor in my No. 1242, and which views, adverse thereto, it
                        gives me pleasure to say were approved by instruction No. 570. It seems to
                        me that our government would do well not to permit our representatives
                        either in China or Japan to take the joint action contemplated in this new
                        project.</p>
                    <p>I would further call your attention to the extraordinary provision of section
                        47 of this order (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), that a foreigner may not
                        institute and prosecute a suit of a civil nature in Her Britannic Majesty’s
                        courts in China or Japan without first obtaining and filing in Her Majesty’s
                        court the consent in writing of the competent authority of his own nation,
                        and also his own agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of Her Majesty’s
                        court, abide its judgment, and, if required, also give security to perform
                        and pay the same.</p>

                        27th ultimo, inclosing a copy of correspondence between himself and W. A.
                        Wooley, esq., Her Britannic Majesty’s acting consul at Osaka and Hiogo, from
                        which it appears that on the 3d ultimo Mr. Stahel transmitted to Mr. Wooley
                        a complaint of Messrs. Meyer &amp; Co., American citizens, against Messrs.
                        Browne &amp; Co., British subjects, for the recovery of $134.20, and that,
                        on the 5th ultimo, Mr. Wooley notified Mr. Stahel that, before action would
                        be taken in the premises, the plaintiffs must file in the British consulate
                        the written consent of Mr. Stahel as well as their own consent, that they
                        would submit to the jurisdiction of the British court, as required by
                        section 47<hi rend="italic">b</hi> of the British Order in Council of 1881,
                        and which undertaking of the plaintiff it was said by the British consul
                        should contain these words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>We, the said plaintiffs, hereby undertake, if required by the court,
                                to give security, as the court may direct, for the payment of fees,
                                damages, costs, or expenses, and for the performance by us of the
                                decision of the court, or of the court of appeal.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>This is certainly a novel requirement, that citizens of the United States,
                        being plaintiffs in a civil action, cannot institute such action against a
                        British subject in a British consular court in Japan until they shall give
                        security as above, and especially that they will perform the decision of the
                        British court, which may be supposed, without a violent construction, to
                        imply that the said court may not only adjudge damages against the
                        plaintiffs and in favor of the defendant, in a claim of the latter in no
                        wise connected with or growing out of the plaintiffs’ cause of action, but
                        also that the court may, in case the plaintiffs fail to perform the court’s
                        decision in the premises, be committed to a British prison by order of a
                        British consular court.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stahel, very properly in my opinion, declined to give his consent to this
                        demand of the British consul, for the reason following, that he had no
                        authority by law or regulation to give such consent.</p>
                    <p>It is further shown by the correspondence between said consuls, inclosed to
                        me with Mr. Stahel’s No. 1628, that on the 23d ultimo Mr. Wooley transmitted
                        to Mr. Stahel the complaint of John Creagh, a British subject, against Frank
                        Upton, an American citizen, for the recovery, by civil action in our
                        consular court, of $21, which Mr. Stahel declined to entertain until, as he
                        advised Mr. Wooley, American citizens should in like manner be permitted to
                        prosecute civil actions in a British court against British subjects without
                        being required to give the undertaking and consular consent now demanded by
                        said British court. To this Mr. Wooley made reply, on the 24th ultimo, that
                        he would bring the refusal of Mr. Stahel to the notice of Her Britannic
                        Majesty’s minister.</p>
                    <p>On the 24th ultimo, Mr. Stahel, in a note to Mr. Wooley, inquired of him
                        whether he had authority to give his consent in writing to the submission of
                        a British subject to the jurisdiction of our consular court, and to a
                        similar undertaking by the British plaintiff in our court to that required
                        of American citizens when plaintiffs in civil actions in the British
                        consular courts.</p>
                    <p>On the same day Mr. Wooley replied that if his consent were asked <pb n="375"
                            xml:id="pg_375" facs="0447"/>in such case by Mr. Stahel he (Mr. Wooley)
                        would be willing to grant it, subject to the approval of Her Britannic
                        Majesty’s minister.</p>
                    <p>Having considered the whole matter as presented by Mr. Stahel and the
                        correspondence between the two consuls, I have concluded that as British
                        subjects are not, it would seem, by any treaty provision entitled to
                        prosecute civil actions against Americans in our consular courts, our
                        consuls are not therefore obliged to entertain such actions, save as a
                        matter of comity, and should not entertain them, unless British consuls will
                        extend like privileges to American citizens, and on the same terms, to sue
                        British subjects in British consular courts. I have accordingly approved Mr.
                        Stahel’s action by a dispatch to him of date the 1st instant (a copy of
                        which is herewith) in which you will please note that I advise him to adhere
                        to his ruling in the premises until otherwise instructed.</p>
                    <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s minister, Sir Harry S. Parkes, has not brought this
                        matter to my notice, nor have I any intimation that he has any power to
                        authorize such consent by a British consul in civil cases brought by British
                        subjects against American citizens in our consular courts.</p>
                    <p>Hoping my views may meet with your approval, I have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your Nos. 1613 and 1628, dated
                            respectively the 17th and 27th ultimo, I have to say that I approve your
                            action in the premises, believing as I do that the right of citizens of
                            the United States to sue in British consular courts in Japan should in
                            all respects be the same as the hitherto acknowledged right of British
                            subjects to sue citizens of the United States in our consular courts in
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>Under existing treaties it may be doubted whether a United States consul
                            is obliged, save as a matter of comity, to try and determine a civil
                            action brought in his court by a British subject against a citizen of
                            the United States. Be this as it may, in my opinion your action in the
                            two cases named is right, and should be adhered to until otherwise
                            instructed.</p>

                        21st of June last, No. 632, from Consul-General Van Buren on the same
                        subject, and, indeed, relating to the precise case which Mr. Stahel presents
                        to you, has received attentive consideration.</p>
                    <p>The general question was brought to the attention of the Department by
                        Consul-General Van Buren in April last, in his dispatch No. 619, and on the
                        9th of May, following, Mr. Bancroft Davis, Assistant Secretary of State,
                        replied by instruction No. 277 to Mr. Yan Buren that he conceived the
                        requirement of the British order in council to be “fair and just.” Although
                        the instruction referred to was brief, it was, nevertheless, the result of
                        careful consideration as Mr. Davis was at that moment engaged in examination
                        of the general question of extraterritoriality, and had the whole subject
                        before him.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stahel^ in his reply to the British consul, an extract from which General
                        Yan Buren transmits in his No. 632 of June 21 last, says: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Further, it appears to me that such submission, with my consent, to
                                the jurisdiction of your court, to have the effect which the order
                                in council you refer to must have contemplated, would require me, in
                                case of need, to execute the judgment of your court, thus placing
                                not only citizens of the United States under the jurisdiction of,
                                but, virtually, the United States consular court officers subject to
                                the orders of, Her Majesty’s court.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I am unable to perceive that any such result would follow from the permission
                        (for that is the proper word) of the United States consul to a citizen of
                        his nation, or from anything in the terms of the order in council which is
                        now before me. The citizen of the United States suing a British subject, in
                        a British court, under the conditions referred to, submits himself to the
                        process of the court in which the proceedings are had—nothing less and
                        certainly nothing more.</p>
                    <p>You advance two objections to the British requirement:</p>
                    <p>First. That the British court may adjudge damages against the American
                        plaintiff and in favor of the English defendant in a claim of the latter in
                        nowise connected with or growing out of the plaintiff’s cause of action.</p>
                    <p>I think you will at once perceive that this objection is met by provision C
                        in 47 of the order in council; but, secondly, you add, that the court may,
                        in case the plaintiff fails to perform its decision in the premises, commit
                        the American citizen to a British consular prison by order of a British
                        consular court.</p>
                    <p>With “great deference for any opinion that you might express on any ^ legal
                        question, I must be permitted to say that that appears to me to be a forced
                        construction of the order. Except for contempt and to enforce specific
                        orders and decrees in chancery, imprisonment cannot properly be an element
                        of procedure in civil actions in English any more than in American courts.
                        Without, however, enlarging on this point, I must believe that in this
                        respect your apprehensions are scarcely warranted.</p>
                    <p>You are quite right, I think, in saying that British subjects resident in
                        Japan cannot, except by comity, sue in an American consular court; the same,
                        of course, must be admitted as to an American’s status toward a British
                        consular court.</p>
                    <p>Now, on this, as well as other grounds, and in the light of the broad view
                        which sound policy dictates should be taken of this extraterritorial
                        judicial system, established as it has been for the common benefit and
                        protection of foreign citizens of Christain nations, resident in the
                        countries in which it is recognized, it appears to me most desirable that,
                        in its administration, harmony and comity should be cultivated between <pb
                            n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0449"/>the different foreign
                        nationalities, and that niceties and technical views should be as far as
                        possible ignored, thereby facilitating that justice to foreign residents in
                        those countries which the system was intended to secure.</p>
                    <p>You will consider the views imparted to General Yan Buren by Mr. Bancroft
                        Davis in the instruction already referred to, a copy of which I inclose, as
                        the ruling of the Department.</p>
                    <p>I also transmit for your convenience a copy of a letter on the general
                        subject, addressed to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Herewith I beg leave to inclose for your
                        information an extract from the report of Sir James Bain, ex-lord provost of
                        Glasgow, and recently made by that gentleman to the Glasgow Chamber of
                        Commerce, together with the words of approval thereof by the British
                        Mercantile Gazette, as published in the Japan Gazette of the 24th
                        instant.</p>
                    <p>Sir James Bain, you will please observe, was appointed the representative of
                        the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce to the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce, and was
                        requested to gather information concerning the commercial relations between
                        Great Britain and the countries of the East. The extract from his report
                        which is inclosed treats only of Japan, and points out the disadvantages to
                        commerce arising from the erritorial restrictions of existing treaties.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the desire of the treaty powers to open the empire to foreign
                        trade, Sir James reports that he was informed by the Japanese minister for
                        foreign affairs that the Japanese Government might grant the liberty of
                        trading everywhere in this empire, but only on condition of foreigners
                        becoming amenable to the native tribunals; but adds that the foreign powers
                        insist upon the privilege of general trade without the condition. The
                        Mercantile Gazette remarks: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>We are disposed to agree with Sir James in considering such an

                                Japan are now based on those of England and France, and as the
                                system of administering justice, and their police, postal, and
                                educational arrangements, bear favorable comparison with those of

                    <p>When the actual condition of Japan comes to be better understood by foreign
                        states—her wonderful progress in the knowledge of good government and
                        judicial administration—it seems to me that just men everywhere will concur
                        with Sir James that the proposition of Japan is perfectly equitable and
                        ought to be accepted by the treaty powers.</p>
                    <p>It is clear to my mind that the European states do not intend to release
                        Japan, China, or any of the Oriental nations from European rule and European
                        government so long as they can prevent it. It is not uncommon to see in
                        European journals the announcement that the proposition to relieve Japan at
                        any time, however remote, from the existing foreign control of her affairs,
                        is not to be entertained by the great powers.</p>

                    <p>The world moves, knowledge advances among men and nations, and through its

                        liberties.</p>

                        <p>In an article headed “Trade with the East,” the British Mercantile
                            Gazette has the following paragraph on Japan:</p>
                        <p>“Sir James Bain, ex lord provost of Glasgow, has returned from a tour
                            around the world, and, having been appointed the representative of the
                            Glasgow Chamber of Commerce to the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce, and
                            requested to gather any information he could concerning the commercial
                            relations between this country and the countries of the East, has
                            presented his report to the Glasgow Chamber. Some portions of Sir
                            James’s report are referred to in another column, but we desire here to
                            direct the attention of those trading with the East to a few points
                            having an important bearing upon the trade of this country with China,
                            India, and Japan.</p>
                        <p>“At present, trade with Japan is conducted under many serious
                            disadvantages, and is limited to such ports as are specified in existing
                            treaties, and to a small district round each. The powers in treaty with
                            Japan, however, now desire to have the whole of Japan open to foreign
                            trade on the same conditions as those which regulate trade with the
                            treaty ports. Sir James Bain states that he was informed by the Japanese
                            minister of foreign affairs that the Japanese Government might grant
                            liberty of trading everywhere, but only on condition of foreigners
                            becoming amenable to the native tribunals of the country. Foreign
                            residents in Japan, it appears, will not accept this, view, but we are
                            disposed to agree with Sir James in considering such an arrangement
                            perfectly equitable, more especially as the laws of Japan are now based
                            on those of England and France, and as their system of administering
                            justice, and their police., postal, and educational arrangements bear
                            favorable comparison with those of most other countries.</p>
                        <p>“While Sir James appears to recognize the importance of having
                            advantageous commercial relations with Japan, he does not anticipate the
                            brilliant future for that country that many who visit it prophesy. He
                            says it lies at ‘the end of the earth,’ and freights to and from must
                            always be expensive.” The country is thickly peopled, and the
                            inhabitants have a struggle to raise a sufficiency of food for
                            themselves. The climate of a large portion of the country is
                            inhospitable; the roads are good, but the rivers are shallow, and the
                            mountainous character of the country does not permit of much railway
                            extension. There is a good coal field at Nagasaki, but it is being
                            rapidly exhausted. Tea, silk, and rice are the staples of export. The
                            first is not admired in Europe, and is sent principally to the United
                            States. The production of silk is considerable and is being increased;
                            rice is of superior quality, but the cost at the port of shipment and
                            the expense of transit prevent it being brought into competition with
                            Rangoon in the London market. The currency is greatly depreciated in
                            consequence of large sums having been spent in unproductive and
                            unnecessary works in the shape of fleets, armies, fortifications, and
                            government offices.”</p>

                        <p>The interest that is at present taken in Corea makes any reliable
                            information with respect to the trade and mineral resources of this
                            hitherto forbidden land of great importance; and the following extract
                            from Mr. Walter Lay’s (commissioner of customs) report to Sir Eobert
                            Hart, inspector-general of customs, on the trade relations between
                            Newchwang and Corea during the year 1881, will be read with interest.
                            Mr. Lay says:</p>
                        <p>“The exchange of commodities between Newchwang and Corea has not been on
                            such an extensive scale lately as it was at one time, owing, it is said,
                            to the footing which the Japanese have secured for themselves on the
                            eastern side of the Corean peninsula. By virtue of a treaty which they
                            have concluded with Coreans, two places on the seaboard, called Bushan,
                            in the south, and Yuanshan, in the east, have been opened to them, and
                            through these new ports they have been supplying the country with many
                            things which were formerly admitted into it on its western side through
                            this port. Many influential Corean merchants, who at one time carried on
                            their business at the Corean Gate, have transferred their operations to
                            the new ports, leaving behind them a class of traders who are simply
                            peddlers.</p>
                        <p>“The old conservative ideas of exclusiveness are fast disappearing from
                            the Corean people, and the Corean Government, unable to stop the march
                            of events, is now allowing its subjects both to leave and to return to
                            their country. Formerly, commercial transactions between Chinese and
                            Coreans were carried on at the Corean Gate, the Coreans having to obtain
                            a pass to go thus far, and being forbidden on pain of death, to go
                            farther. Now, it appears that a Corean has simply to pay duty on his
                            goods to enable him, if he cannot dispose of them at the Gate, to carry
                            them where he likes. He can bring them down here, if he thinks the
                            market will suit him better, but he cannot take them beyond Shanhaikwan,
                            unless he holds a proper pass, which is a wooden ticket, and he can only
                            obtain this if he is attached to the suite of an embassador.</p>
                        <p>“An embassy is sent from Corea to Pekin at periodical intervals, the
                            number of individuals composing it being about two hundred. To each of
                            these a passport is given so that he may have something to show should
                            his official right to travel be called in question. The holders of
                            passports either bring with them Corean productions for sale, or, for a
                            consideration, they transfer their passports to others for that purpose.
                            Without a passport a Corean can come as far as this port, but he cannot
                            travel in the direction of Pekin.</p>
                        <p>“The restrictions against the exit of Coreans from their country having
                            been relaxed, there is no longer any necessity to confine operations to
                            the Gate, and the fairs, therefore, which have been held there three
                            times a year, are now losing all their former importance. The Chinese
                            are beginning to feel dissatisfied at the influx of Coreans into their
                            country, arguing very rationally that privileges to trade should be
                            reciprocal. Whilst Coreans can come in this direction with freedom,
                            Chinese who venture across the border do so at the peril of their lives.
                            Far north, in the wilds of Manchuria, the Coreans have been induced to
                            settle on Chinese territory, and in one of the Peking Gazettes issued a
                            few months ago there appeared a memorial from the Tartar general of
                            Kirin, requesting the imperial sanction to allow taxes to be paid in
                            cattle to suit the convenience of settlers, who were not allowed to
                            bring away money from their own country.</p>
                        <p>“The chief item which the Coreans bring across the border is ginseng, and
                            this is the most valuable. Wild ginseng is found among the hills, and
                            takes more than thirty years to arrive at perfection. The root can he
                            used when it has been in the ground about twelve years, but it is not so
                            valuable as that of mature age. The other kinds of ginseng, known as
                            first and second quality Corean, are a special branch of culture. Only
                            well-to-do people can afford to set apart the ground for its
                            cultivation, and to devote to it the time which it requires. The usual
                            period allowed for the root to attain its full growth is from five to
                            six years; it is then dug up, washed, and dried in a pan over a fire,
                            and after the skin has been scraped away it is ready for the market.
                            Once every year a small flower is put forth, the seed from which is
                            carefully preserved and sown the following year. The root thrives, best
                            in a sandy soil.</p>
                        <p>“Among other things that Corea produces are gold dust, tiger skins, sable
                            skins, and human hair. An experimental shipment of the last-named to
                            England was made last year, but with what result has not yet been
                            ascertained. Tigers and leopards abound in Corea; but few skins from
                            that country pass through this port.</p>
                        <p>“In his work on Corea, Pere Dallet affirms that the mountains conceal a
                            wealth of gold, silver, and copper. Gold, he says, may be met with in
                            the north by merely turning over the soil, but that excavations for this
                            hidden treasure are not allowed under the severest penalties, the people
                            not even venturing to pick it up on account of the impossibility of
                            disposing of it. Some assert that the government discourage mining
                            enterprise, because they are afraid of exciting the cupidity of powerful
                            neighbors <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0452"/>;others attribute it
                            to the fear of a revolt, which they are afraid would infallibly break
                            out if a large number of workmen were concentrated on ground far away
                            from the Capital and where there is little or no official authority.
                            Iron, Pere Dallet says, is so plentiful in some places that after heavy
                            rain it may be freely obtained— people picking up as much as they like
                            of it.</p>
                        <p>“A country with such mineral resources as Corea is said to possess can
                            scarcely remain closed much longer to the outer world. The Japanese have
                            secured a footing-there, and it now remains for England, with her large
                            commercial interests, to obtain one also. I am given to understand that
                            Coreans generally are in favor of opening the country to trade and
                            simply await the advent of foreigners to receive them with open arms.
                            This may mean that the mercantile portion of the people would like to
                            see foreigners appear; it does not necessarily indicate a desire on the
                            part of the official class to welcome a change.</p>
                        <p>“In exchange for the various articles which Coreans bring down here, they
                            obtain foreign piece goods, native cloth, silk piece goods, and
                            treasure. They also like foreign dyes, and are not proof against the
                            seductive charms of opium. As the. trade of this port has been almost
                            entirely in the hands of the Chinese since it was first opened, it is
                            more than likely that it has been the Chinaman, and not the foreigner,
                            who has introduced this well-known narcotic into this new and unexplored
                            country.”—Shanghai Courier.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: At Liberia College, which, under the
                        presidency of Hon. Edward W. Blyden, secretary of the interior, has recently
                        entered upon a new and hopeful career of usefulness, on Wednesday, November
                        16, 1881, there was held an examination of the students, preparatory to the
                        vacation season.</p>
                    <p>The class of freshmen acquitted themselves in a most creditable and
                        satisfactory manner. They were examined in arithmetic, geography, Latin,
                        Greek, Arabic, algebra, and physics.</p>
                    <p>The president of the republic and cabinet were present, the chief justice,
                        distinguished citizens and a large concourse of citizens, the consul of the
                        Netherlands and myself. President Blyden in a brief speech urged upon the
                        people the importance of education as a means of advancing the state. The
                        President of Liberia spoke in eulogistic terms of the new impetus he
                        believed would be given education through the college.</p>
                    <p>In response to the request of President Blyden, I made some remarks, in which
                        I took occasion to point out the very rare opportunities the students of
                        Liberia College enjoyed in receiving an education in Africa, and under the
                        direction, instruction, and supervision of a negro gentleman such as
                        President Blyden, whose purpose was not to make of them Saxons nor Celts,
                        either in education or religion, but to fit them for the peculiar,
                        important, arduous, but grand, work of being useful as negroes for the
                        negro, of being useful in advancing civilization in Africa for Africa, and
                        that it may be a power in the world. * * *</p>
                    <p>I said, “The work of the negro race and Africa is your work, the negroes’
                        work, and will not be done until the negro is fitted for its accomplishment
                        by proper culture of heart and head, and full, untrammelled development of
                        his racial instincts. Delay is not failure. The future for us is in the
                        keeping of God. His work never fails. And, gentlemen, you no doubt, in the
                        secrecy of your own reflections as future citizens of Liberia, ask
                        yourselves to what end is this preparation, is this work. It has a special
                        political bearing: The making of Liberia, in the language of my government,
                        through the late Secretary of State, Hon. Win. M. Evarts, ‘what her rulers
                        should value before all else, a thoroughly independent and strong
                        power.’—(Dispatch No. 40, February 2, 1880). Says the present honored
                        incumbent of the office of Secretary of State, Hon. James G. Blaine, in
                        reply to a dispatch of mine, ‘ Your views in the main reflect the desire of
                        this government that Liberia should do everything which may be done to
                        increase her strength and prosperity, by just measures looking to the
                        development of her great natural resources.’ As future citizens, this is
                        your work. By education, such as you are receiving, alone can this be
                        successfully done.”</p>
                    <p>I concluded by assuring the assemblage of the very sincere interna my
                        government has in the ultimate success of Liberia.</p>
                    <p>With an apology for the length of this dispatch, I beg, &amp;c,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 1st of December, 1822, the pioneer
                        settlers here on Cape Messurado, the site now occupied by and known as
                        Monrovia, the final engagement was fought which determined the possibility
                        of civilized settlement in this part of Liberia.</p>
                    <p>This event is annually celebrated in honor of the victory gained by the
                        civilized negro over his misguided heathen brother.</p>
                    <p>The commemoration exercises were held in the Methodist church. The cabinet
                        and diplomatic and consular officers resident here were invited. The absence
                        from the imposing gathering of the President was due to illness, to which I
                        recently made allusion.</p>
                    <p>Speeches were delivered by Messrs. Barclay and Brown, commemorative of the
                        occasion. There was a marked difference in the tone of the addresses as
                        compared with those usually made on such occasions. The custom, I learn, is
                        to make that class of speech on the recurrence of the day, which tends to
                        keep alive a feeling of alienation from the native races, which has so long
                        existed and which has been so harmful to Liberia’s progress.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to state that the foremost men of the nation deprecate the past,
                        and by example are making a reform in this matter.</p>
                    <p>After the conclusion of the exercises at the church, the cabinet and foreign
                        representatives, the orators, and a few distinguished citizens were lunched
                        at the mayor’s residence. Sentiments were offered by the mayor. First in
                        order was the President of Liberia, to which the secretary of the interior,
                        by the request of the secretary of state, spoke.</p>
                    <p>Among the excellent thoughts expressed by Dr. Blyden, one struck me as
                        singularly wise and worthy of reflection. In alluding to the late war in our
                        country, a struggle between brothers, he reminded his fellow-citizens that
                        there was no commemoration of victory, but that on Decoration Day the nation
                        puts on weeds and strews chaplets of flowers on the blue and the gray. He

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the receipt of Department dispatch No. 199,
                        November 29, I addressed a note to Señor Mariscal, asking him to appoint a
                        day and hour upon which I could read it to him. A copy of my note I inclose.
                        Señor Mariscal replied that he would receive me at the foreign office on
                        Friday, the 16th instant. A translation of his note I inclose.</p>
                    <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0455"/>
                    <p>I kept the appointment, read to hirn your dispatch, and left with him a copy
                        thereof. I also, in a separate note, conveyed to the President of Mexico,
                        through the foreign secretary, the formal invitation of the President of the
                        United States to name two commissioners to a congress of the independent
                        countries of North and South America to be held at the city of Washington,
                        on the 24th day of November, 1882. A copy of my note I inclose. Señor
                        Mariscal informed me that he would lay the matter before the President and
                        promised an early reply to the invitation.</p>
                    <p>On the 22d December I received your dispatch No. 201, December 1, in which
                        you informed me that there was an error of date in your dispatch No. 199,
                        December 1, and that the 22d of November, 1882, should be substituted for
                        “24th.” This correction I made in a note which I addressed to Senor Mariscal
                        on the 22d December, 1881, a copy whereof I inclose.</p>
                    <p>The receipt of this note Senor Mariscal acknowledged on the 22d December,
                        1881. A translation of his note I inclose.</p>
                    <p>On the 29th December I received your dispatch No. 202, December 3. On the
                        31st December in an interview which I had of Senor Mariscal I stated to him
                        that the proposed congress was to be held under the auspices of the United
                        States, and that the commissioners appointed thereto would be at no expense
                        except for their maintenance while in attendance upon the sessions
                        thereof.</p>
                    <p>The opportunity presented itself for me to suggest that it would be advisable
                        that one at least of the commissioners to be appointed should be acquainted
                        with the English language, and I took advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>Señor Mariscal said that he supposed the Mexican minister at Washington and
                        some one from Mexico would be appointed. He did not, however, inform me that
                        his government had determined upon sending any commissioners. To avoid any
                        possible misapprehension on the part of the Mexican Government as to the
                        purpose of the United States in respect of the expenses of the proposed
                        congress, I deemed it proper to address him a note upon the subject, which I
                        did on the 3d January. A copy whereof I inclose. You will observe that it is
                        an extract from your dispatch (No. 202).</p>
                    <p>More than a fortnight having expired since my interview with Señor Mariscal,
                        and not having received any communication from him upon the subject, I have
                        considered it proper to inform you of what has taken place.</p>

                            Government of the United States, which, to this end, will supply a
                            suitable hall for the meetings of the commissioners, will take charge of
                            all necessary arrangements, and, at its own expense, will meet all the
                            material requirements of the congress, reporting and interpreting the
                            proceedings and printing the resultant protocols, in Spanish and
                            English, for the use of all the parties. Secretaries, clerks, and
                            copyists in both languages will be provided and paid by the United
                            States—no expense being left to the invited countries except the
                            maintenance of their own commissioners.</p>
                        <p>I renew to your excellency, &amp;c.,</p>

                            excellency’s note of the 15th December last past, in which, referring to
                            our interview of the same day, and to the important dispatch which, on
                            the 29th of November, had been addressed to you from Washington, by the
                            honorable Secretary of State, of which document you were pleased to
                            furnish me a copy, inviting, in the name of the Government of the United
                            States of America, the President of the United States of Mexico to send
                            two commissioners to a general congress of all the independent nations
                            of North and South America, to meet in Washington on the 24th November,
                            1882, with the view of examining and discussing the methods by which war
                            may be avoided between the nations of America; said commissioners to be
                            instructed and to be clothed with necessary powers to fulfill the trust
                            confided to them.</p>
                        <p>The object which your excellency’s goyernment has in view by this
                            invitation deserves the most sincere approbation and applause of the
                            government to which it is addressed.</p>
                        <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0458"/>
                        <p>To avoid the evils of war which the Hon. Mr. Blaine, in few words, so
                            eloquently describes is, no doubt, a most noble aspiration and of the
                            greatest importance (trans-eendencia”) to the progress, moral and
                            material, of the peoples, and which involves the grandest results to
                            humanity., So interesting a project, which is its own recommendation to
                            all the nations of the globe, acquires a double importance when
                            it.relatee to populations, such as are those of the new world, united
                            either by ties of consanguinity or by a community of political
                            institutions, or at least by this peculiar position which they all hold
                            towards the nations of the Old World. It is certain that no American
                            government can or at least should feel less impressively than that of
                            your excellency, the dangers and horrors of war, above all if the
                            contest should arise between people of the same kindred (pueblos
                            hermanos); and it is equally certain that no chief of a government on
                            the continent discovered by Columbus, could be less sensible than the
                            President of the United States of America to the necessity of putting an
                            end to these fratricidal strifes. The whole difficulty, if one presents
                            itself, is in the practical method by which an end as justly applauded
                            as it is universally aspired for may be brought about.</p>
                        <p>The attitude which the Washington Government has assumed in this
                            humanitarian enterprise is entitled to the eulogy of the entire world
                            and to the most favorable considerations of the nations interested
                            therein. Your excellency’s government deserves particular encomiums for
                            its respect for the right, in not distinguishing between the weak and
                            the strong, when it protests that it does not pretend either to dictate
                            or compel in this question, but only shows the good will and
                            disinterested solicitude of a friend. While protesting against the use
                            of force for the purpose of promoting ite absolute proscription between
                            the American nations, the one which amongst them undertakes so generous
                            a propaganda is the least interested, because her great resources make
                            war less terrible to her. It certainly cannot be alleged that she has
                            used her position as the principal power in the New World to impose
                            authoritatively the methods of settling disputes between her neighbors,
                            except by appealing, as she has done, to an amicable judgment to the end
                            of arriving at a free agreement, the only fountain of obligations and
                            rights for sovereign entities.</p>
                        <p>Since 1853 this government has been pledged to this excellent design, in
                            consequence of a recommendation to the President by the Senate, to the
                            effect that he should, on all occasions in which it should be possible,
                            to insert in treaties an article by which it should be agreed to submit
                            the difficulties which might arise between the contracting parties to
                            the decision of arbitrators chosen by a common accord; and even anterior
                            to that date—that is to say in 1848—there was inserted, within prudent
                            limits, a similar clause in the treaty of peace concluded in that year
                            between our two nations.</p>
                        <p>It is not, therefore, surprising that the United States should now submit
                            generally the same idea to all the American states, nor that Mexico
                            should be willing to adopt it. The Mexican Government, which found
                            itself, with regret, unable to accept the invitation of Colombia to take
                            part, through its representatives, in a congress which was to have
                            assembled at Panama with the object of entering into a treaty similar to
                            the one which Colombia had made with Chili, by which she would be
                            compromised for all time to submit to arbitration every question which
                            might arise between the contracting governments; this government which
                            admires and applauds the tendencies of such an agreement, did not then
                            consider itself prepared, from consideration of the just and legitimate
                            interests which it is called upon to defend (to accept said
                            proposition), to-day has the satisfaction to observe that in the
                            prospect of an American Peace Congress, suggested by your excellency’s
                            government, the serious difficulties which prevented it from
                            participating in the one projected by Colombia have been done away
                            with.</p>
                        <p>To-day it is seen that in the (proposed) congress all the nations of
                            America, without excluding any of them either because of their peculiar
                            form of government, or from the superior elements of power which they
                            may possess, are to be admitted, and that all should contract the same
                            obligations upon the footing of perfect equality, circumstances which
                            give to the actual present project a practical importance which was
                            wanting in the other to this republic.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, although the project of the United States does not
                            prescribe the measures necessary to be taken to avoid war nor propose
                            the draft of a definite convention, it consequently leaves the parties
                            in interest complete liberty to discuss and stipulate upon these points,
                            and to designate, in case arbitration should be adopted, cases which are
                            to be submitted to it, and those cases in which its application is to be
                            reputed impossible.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the assembling of the commissioners being fixed for a date in
                            which the questions now pending (to those who may be interested, which
                            thing should be respected) will have had their solution or will have
                            disappeared completely.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons the Mexican Government does not, at this time, feel the
                            inconveniences which heretofore embarrassed it, and deems it compatible
                            with the national interests to send its representatives to an assembly
                            which will discuss what measures may be taken to secure peace on the
                            American continent.</p>

                        <p>In consequence of which the president of this republic accepts with
                            pleasure the invitation which, through your excellency, the President of
                            the United States of America has tendered him to send two

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith the address of the
                        President to both houses of Congress, on the occasion of the opening of the
                        regular session thereof on the 1st instant, as it is published in the Diario
                        Oficial of that date, together with a translation thereof.</p>
                    <p>The President states that the financial condition of the country is good;
                        that its revenues are sufficient to meet its engagements; and that for the
                        first six months of the present fiscal year “they have exceeded the sum
                        received during the six months preceding upwards of $2,000,000; that the
                        work on the railroads is progressing, and that telegraphic communication is
                        being extended in many directions.</p>
                    <p>The foreign relations of the country are satisfactory except perhaps with
                        Guatemala. He repudiates the idea of any desire to extend the territory of
                        Mexico by the conquest of the Central American states, and with reference to
                        that nation (Guatemala) and alluding to the questions pending between them,
                        he says, that if Guatemala will renounce her unrealizable pretensions to a
                        retrocession of Chiapas and Soconusco for the supposed damages which she
                        claims for having been despoiled thereof, the good faith of the policy which
                        he announces towards the Central American states would soon be vindicated.
                        He announces the purchase of 18,500 stand of arms of the most approved
                        pattern and latest system, which, with those now in the arsenals and in the
                        hands of the army, place the nation upon a respectable footing.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen of the Chamber of Deputies and
                                Senators</hi>:* * * The good harmony which has for some time past
                            existed between Mexico and the foreign powers with whom she has
                            relations has been preserved, and has increased, and we receive from
                            them frequent evidences of their friendly feeling towards us.</p>
                        <p>Our relations with Guatemala continue in the same condition they were in
                            when I gave you an account of them in September last,</p>
                        <p>When treating of interests of such magnitude it is prudent, without
                            neglecting them, to leave to time that natural influence which it
                            sometimes advantageously exercises in bringing complicated questions to
                            a solution.</p>
                        <p>I must, therefore, for your information, as well as for that of Mexico
                            and of the Governments of Central America, explain clearly and
                            succinctly what are the aspirations of my administration in our
                            difficulties with Guatemala, and I hope that you will not deny to me the
                            co-operation necessary to bring them to an end.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the circumstance that in former times some of the republics which
                            are grouped together in the center of the continent, formed part of the
                            Mexican nation, has given rise to the idea that our republic, stimulated
                            by its actual condition of tranquillity and progress, wishes to possess
                            itself, in whole or in part, of these politi cal <pb n="388"
                                xml:id="pg_388" facs="0460"/>entities, which are now sovereign and
                            independent, and annex them to our own territory—a lamentable error
                            which might alienate from us the sympathy of the people thereof, from
                            whom no conflict separates us, and with whom we desire to cultivate and
                            strengthen, if possible, the most disinterested friendship</p>
                        <p>When we possess a territory of the greatest richness, washed by two
                            oceans, capable of supporting in prosperity a population of one hundred
                            millions, it would be insensate in us to attempt the conquest of those
                            countries, from which we are separated by great distances, and we would
                            unceasingly repel in them those proper sentiments of liberty and
                            independence which are as firmly rooted in their soil as they are in our
                            own. And I solemnly declare to Congress, and to the nation which it
                            represents, that my administration has no other views with reference to
                            the questions which now exist with the southern republic, than the
                            defense of the territory and dignity of Mexico, and looks only to the
                            establishing of a well-defined boundary which will be adopted by a
                            common accord between Mexico and Guatemala. If the government of that
                            country will renounce the unrealizable idea of reoccupying Chiapas and
                            Soconusco, or of obtaining an indemnity for supposed damages for having
                            been despoiled of the same, the sincerity of the policy which in thebe
                            few words I have indicated would be soon made apparent.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your telegram of the 3d instant was received
                        late in the evening of the 3d. The first portion thereof was quite
                        unintelligible. The latter part, however, showed me that I was instructed to
                        apply for permission for United States troops to follow certain Indians into
                        Mexico until their pursuit could be taken up by a competent force of Mexican
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>As I considered that action in the matter if taken at all should be taken at
                        once, I proceeded to Señor Mariscal’s residence. On my way there I called at
                        the telegraph office with the view of ascertaining and correcting the errors
                        in the telegram, but the office was closed.</p>
                    <p>Señor Mariscal had received a telegram upon the same subject from Señor
                        Romero at an early hour of the day. He had, he told me, endeavored to bring
                        it to the notice of the President, but had been unable to do so on account
                        of his (the President’s) illness. He hoped, however, to be able to see him
                        on the following day, when he would discuss the matter with him, and when he
                        should be in possession of the note which I informed him I would address
                        him. This note I wrote on my return, and sent it to him early in the morning
                        of the 4th. A copy thereof I inclose.</p>
                    <p>I could not make it more explicit because I could not make out from your
                        telegram the name of the general referred to, nor the tribe of Indians who
                        were being pursued, nor at what point the crossing of our troops was
                        expected to take place from.</p>
                    <p>I had some conversation with Señor Mariscal upon the subject, and while he
                        said he did not wish to be understood as speaking for the President, he
                        called my attention to the circumstance that when I had made a similar
                        application to the Mexican Government some time ago, which had been acceded
                        to upon the condition that a like permission should, the case arising, be
                        granted to Mexican troops, no reply whatever had been given.</p>
                    <p>He also stated that not long since he had made a similar request upon our
                        government, which had been refused. He appeared to think the United States
                        were asking what they would not give.</p>
                    <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0461"/>
                    <p>He directed my attention also to the clause of the federal constitution,
                        which provides that no foreign soldier as such shall he permitted to come
                        into Mexico without the consent thereto of Congress (Paragraph III, No. XYI)
                        5 and he said that, even should the President submit the question to
                        Congress, some time would elapse before it could be brought to a vote.</p>
                    <p>I now inclose a copy and translation of Senor Mariscal’s reply. It is dated
                        on the 4th instant, but was received by me only on the 5th. As you will have
                        observed, the President declines to submit the question to the Senate, that
                        authority having twice, as Señor Mariscal says, refused to grant the request
                        except under certain conditions which were submitted to the Government of
                        the United States, to which no reply was made, unless he (the President)
                        should be informed that a similar request, under the same circumstances,
                        would be acceded to by the Government of the United States. This I
                        telegraphed to you on the 5th instant.</p>

                            receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, transmitting a copy of a
                            note from the minister of Mexico at this capital, in relation to the
                            reciprocal passage of troops across the border, in pursuit of fugitive
                            Indians, and a copy of a telegram from the United States minister at the
                            city of Mexico, presenting the terms upon which such passage may be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>In reply thereto, I beg to state that this correspondence was duly
                            referred to the General of the Army, who, in returning the same,
                            expresses the opinion that “the terms proposed by the Mexican minister
                            in his communication of May 12, 1882, are just and fair, and should be
                            accepted pure and simple.”</p>
                        <p>The views of the General of the Army are concurred in by this department,
                            and should they receive the approval of the Department of State, the
                            necessary instructions will be issued by the military authorities to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 189, November 10, 1881, was
                        received by me on the 2d December. In it I was instructed to call the
                        attention of the Mexican Government to the case of Mr. Thomas R. Gartrell,
                        and his wife, Nellie <hi rend="smallcaps">j.</hi> Gartrell, who were
                        murdered while traveling, near the <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0463"
                        />city of Durango, and to request that it take the competent measures for
                        the arrest of the offender, his prosecution and punishment.</p>
                    <p>These instructions I complied with in a note which I addressed to Señor
                        Mariscal, on the 3d December, a copy whereof I inclose.</p>
                    <p>Señor Mariscal not having made any reply to this note, I, on the 10th
                        instant, addressed him another note upon the subject. A copy of this note I
                        inclose.</p>
                    <p>I have to-day received Señor Mariscal’s reply. A translation I inclose.</p>
                    <p>You will observe that Señor Mariscal, while furnishing information as to what
                        has been done in the case, as far as he knows, states that if the purpose of
                        my notes is limited to bringing to the knowledge of the Mexican Government
                        the commission of a crime, with the view of having the perpetrators thereof
                        punished, he is pleased to have attended to my request, but that if the
                        purpose is to lay the omen of a claim, as has been done in other cases, he
                        has been instructed to say, at once, that diplomatic intervention cannot
                        possibly be admitted, both because the case does not warrant it, and because
                        the matriculation record of the foreign office does not show that Mr. and
                        Mrs. Gartrell were citizens of the United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Thomas N. Gartrell, and his wife, Nellie
                            J. Gartrell, citizens of the United States, arrived at the city of
                            Chihuahua from El Paso, Tex., in July last. Their purpose was to travel
                            in the republic of Mexico. At Chihuahua they purchased saddle-horses and
                            pack-mules, and employed a Mexican servant to accompany them on their
                            travels. They reached Hidalgo del Panal, Chihuahua, where they remained
                            several days. They then proceeded to the city of Durango, stopping at
                            various points <hi rend="italic">en route</hi>, especially Tudé, State
                            of Durango, where they remained a week or more.</p>
                        <p>They left Durango, during the latter part of the month of September, for
                            Mazatlan, after which nothing was heard of them until about the 10th of
                            October, when their bodies were found about ten leagues from the city of
                            Durango, on the Mazatlan road. They had evidently been murdered for the
                            purpose of robbery. It would seem that the man was shot while asleep. It
                            is supposed that the woman must have been awakened by the discharge of
                            fire-arms, and had attempted to make her escape, as her body was
                            discovered about one hundred paces from that of her husband. Her
                            clothing had been torn to rags, and her body showed marks which she had
                            received in her struggle with her assassin. As it was known that she
                            wore on her person a belt containing gold, the object of the assault
                            upon her was doubtless to obtain this gold. They had also with them
                            drafts on a banking-house in San Antonio, Tex., for a considerable
                            amount which are said to have been taken possession of.</p>
                        <p>The servant who was with them has not been seen since they left Durango.
                            Suspicion naturally points to him as the murderer. His name, I regret to
                            say, I am not able to furnish, but as the party tarried some time at
                            Chihuahua, where they hired the servant, it would seem that the
                            authorities at that place would not have great difficulty in
                            ascertaining who he was.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing are the facts, as they have been reported to my government,
                            and I have been instructed to submit them to the consideration of your
                            excellency’s government, and, as the murder appears to have been a
                            particularly aggravated one, to request that it take the competent
                            measures for the arrest of the offender, his prosecution and
                            punishment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: As soon as your excellency’s note
                            of the 30th December last, which refers to the assassination of Thomas
                            Gartrell and his wife in the neighborhood of Durango, I transmitted its
                            contents to the governors of the States of Chihuahua and Durango; to the
                            first that he might be able to ascertain the name and obtain a
                            description of the servant whom Gartrell had taken in the city of
                            Chihuahua so that he might at once give them to the second, and they
                            were both requested to cause the arrest of the supposed assassin and to
                            have him delivered over to the competent authority.</p>
                        <p>The governor of Chihuahua replied on the 29th of the same month that he
                            had issued the necessary orders as requested, and that he would inform
                            the governor of the State of Durango of the result of his efforts. All
                            of which I have the honor to inform your excellency in reply to your
                            first cited note, and to the one which you addressed to me on the 10th

                        <p>Before closing the present note, I consider it to be my duty to explain
                            to your excellency that if your above cited notes have no other purpose
                            than to recommend an investigation of the crime committed, in order that
                            justice may be done, the government takes pleasure in having complied
                            with your request; but if, as in other cases, your excellency’s official
                            intention in the one in question is the omen of a reclamation, the
                            government considers itself compelled, at once, through me, to declare
                            to your excellency that it is not possible to accept your intervention,
                            not only because there is nothing in the case to justify it, but because
                            it does not appear on the register of matriculation in the department
                            under my charge that Mr. Gartrell and his wife are citizens of the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith, for your information, a
                        copy of a letter of the 10th instant from the Secretary of War, concerning a
                        memorandum, compiled from official sources, concerning the movements of the
                        American troops and the co-operation of the Mexican forces against the
                        Chiricahua Indians from the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona Territory,
                        previous to the almost total destruction of the remnant of those renegades
                        by the troops of General Fuero of the Mexican army, as appears from a recent
                        note to the Department from the minister of Mexico here, to whom I have
                        appropriately communicated a copy of the memorandum only, as of probable
                        interest to himself and his government.</p>

                            respecting the incursions of the Chiricahua Indians into Mexican

                                Chiricahua Indians from the San Carlo Reservation, Arizona, and
                                their pursuit into Mexico.</hi></head>
                        <p>On the 17th of April last, Juh (the chief of the band of Chiricahuas
                            which broke out in September, 1881) returned secretly from Mexico with
                            some 60 of his band to the San Carlos Reservation and compelled the
                            remainder of the Chiricahuas under Loco, consisting of about 40 men and
                            300 women and children, to leave the reservation.</p>
                        <p>They left on the night of April 18, 1882, killing the Indian chief of
                            police, Sterling, and the police sergeant. They proceeded towards Fort
                            Thomas, killing ten men, women, and children on Eagle Creek, and the
                            murder of other citizens in the same valley was reported.</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Schofield, Sixth Cavalry, with two troops of his
                            regiment from Fort Thomas, pursued the band, and part of the command
                            under Lieutenant Sands overtook the fugitives and pursued them for three
                            miles, but getting out of ammunition returned.</p>
                        <p>On the 20th of April, Captain Gordon, Sixth Cavalry, with 119 men
                            (including an Indian scout company), left Fort Grant to intercept the
                            band should they go out by Eagle Creek or Clifton.</p>
                        <p>The commanding officer District of New Mexico (Colonel Mackenzie) having
                            been advised of the trouble, Lieutenant-Colonel Forsyth, with four
                            troops of the Fourth Cavalry, at Sepor, N. Mex., were on the alert to
                            co-operate.</p>
                        <p>General McDowell ordered Harris’s troop of the First Cavalry to report to
                            General Willcox, and immediate steps were taken to use all the troops in
                            the Department of Arizona available.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th of April the General of the Army, then in San Francisco,
                            telegraphed suggesting that a regiment of infantry from Texas might be
                            ordered to report to Colonel Mackenzie to patrol the line of the
                            Southern Pacific Railroad, so as to leave the troops in Arizona and New
                            Mexico free to take the field.</p>
                        <p>The General also instructed General McDowell that Loco’s band should be
                            attacked wherever found, without regard to relative numbers.</p>
                        <p>Alarming reports were received of the loss of life, &amp;c., from the
                            depredation of the Chiricahuas, but many of the reports proved to be
                            considerably exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th of April, Lieutenant-Colonel Forsyth, with his command, found
                            the hostiles in an impregnable position in Stein’s Peak Range, New
                            Mexico, where he attacked and fought them with a loss of 5 men killed
                            and 5 men wounded, killing 2 Indians and wounding a number.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th April, General McDowell repeated a dispatch from General
                            Willcox stating that Captain Overton, Sixth Cavalry, reported the
                            Indians had killed many people along the Upper Gila, and that he was
                            pushing forward on trail of main body towards Doubtful Cañon in Stein’s
                            Peak Range.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th, General Sheridan reported that Colonel Forsyth had a force
                            of about 500 men (Fourth Cavalry and scouts) with him, and that he and
                            Captain Tupper, with two troops Sixth Cavalry, was close on trail of the
                            Indians. General Sheridan said he could send Third Cavalry at any
                            moment.</p>
                        <p>April 28, General Willcox repeated by telegraph that the actual outbreak
                            could be handled with the force in the department, but that as there
                            were indications of fresh outbreaks reported, an additional regiment of
                            cavalry and one of infantry should be sent. He also, on the same day,
                            gave the strength of the troops in the Department of Arizona as 613
                            cavalry and 487 infantry.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th April, Captain Tupper, with Troops G and M, Sixth Cavalry,
                            struck the Indians about 35 miles east of Cloverdale, and had a
                            desperate fight with them, killing <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394"
                                facs="0466"/>12 or 15 Indians, including Loco’s son, and capturing
                            70 head of stock. The fight lasted from daybreak till noon. Captain
                            Tupper lost 1 man killed and 2 wounded.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Forsyth and Captain Tupper united; then continued the pursuit of
                            the Indians towards Mexico.</p>
                        <p>May 2, General McDowell telegraphed that the governor of Arizona had
                            called upon General Willcox for protection for the settlements, and that
                            he therefore thought that General Willcox would need the additional
                            troops asked for.</p>
                        <p>The First Infantry and Third Cavalry were thereupon definitely ordered to
                            Arizona (General Orders of April 29 and May 1, from District of
                            Missouri), and the Seventh Infantry, in Department of Dakota, was
                            ordered to be held in readiness.</p>
                        <p>May 3, 1882, General Sheridan telegraphed that 13 Indians were killed in
                            Captain Tupper’s fight; that the Indians had crossed into Mexico and
                            that Colonel Garcia with a column of Mexican troops had attacked the
                            Indians, killing 78 and capturing 33. Colonel Forsyth returned to Sepor,
                            N. Mex., from the pursuit of the Indians on the 4th of May, having kept
                            up the pursuit of Loco’s band until he received reliable intelligence of
                            the practical annihilation by the Mexican troops under Garcia.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Forsyth reported the number of Indians killed from April 25 to 29
                            as 98 (including the 78 killed by the Mexicans).</p>
                        <p>June 3, General Sheridan telegraphed that a dispatch from General Fuero
                            (commanding the Mexican forces in Chihuahua) to General Pope informed
                            him that Juh’s band of Apaches were defeated by the Mexican forces at
                            Bosque de Santiago, May 25, with loss of 37 Indians killed and 10
                            captured, and this, with the losses of Loco’s band in previous fights,
                            practically finishes up the renegades from San Carlos.</p>
                        <p>June 5, General McDowell telegraphed that it was reported that various
                            small parties of Indians were in the Whitestone, Dragoon, Huachuca and
                            Chiricahua Mountains, and that troops from Forts Huachuca, Bowie, and
                            Camp Price have been hunting them, while the San Pedro Valley and
                            crossing of the Gila towards the San Carlos Reservation was guarded by
                            troops from Forts Grant and Thomas.</p>
                        <p>No further disturbances at the San Carlos Reservation have been
                            reported.</p>
                        <p>Upon the arrival of the First Infantry and Third Cavalry, they were
                            distributed to the most exposed posts in Arizona.</p>
                        <p>On the 2d May (in response to a House resolution) the aggregate number of
                            troops available in the Department of Arizona, after the arrival of the
                            First Infantry and Third Cavalry, was stated to be 2,377
                            (approximate).</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received and considered your dispatch
                        No. 447, of the 17th ultimo, transmitting copies of the correspondence
                        which, in pursuance of the Department’s instruction No. 189, of 10th
                        November last, you opened with the Mexican foreign secretary in regard to
                        the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Gartrell, near the city of Durango.</p>
                    <p>I cannot but express the regret I feel on observing Mr. Mariscal’s statement
                        that, if your representation of the facts is the omen of reclamation, the
                        Mexican Government considers itself compelled at once to declare through him
                        that it is not possible to accept your intervention, * * because it does not
                        appear on the register of matriculation under Mr. Mariscal’s charge that Mr.
                        Gartrell and his wife are citizens of the United States.</p>
                    <p>This question of the prior necessity of matriculation, as an alien resident
                        of Mexico under Mexican law, before a foreigner can be entitled, in Mexico,
                        to the assertion of the rights which international law ascribes to all
                        foreigners, is one of the few questions between the two countries which
                        remain pending in an unsatisfactory condition.</p>
                    <p>The records of your legation show that the subject has been the occasion of
                        discussion between the two governments for many years. As <pb n="395"
                            xml:id="pg_395" facs="0467"/>you have doubtless familiarized yourself
                        with the correspondence, I need refer to it no farther than to say that the
                        divergence as to the manner in which the fact of matriculation was to be
                        accomplished has been settled on the acceptance by the Mexican Government of
                        the presentation of the visaed passport as evidence of foreign citizenship,
                        and that the points remaining open concern only the rights which accrue to
                        foreigners in virtue of such passport, or which may be denied to them in the
                        absence of such further formality as is now insisted upon.</p>
                    <p>This government is not disposed to question the convenience of formal
                        matriculation as evidencing the right of foreigners resident in Mexico to
                        certain civil and domiciliary rights prescribed under the Mexican law. But
                        it does question the claim of Mexico to debar from the protection of their
                        own government citizens of the United States who may be temporarily in
                        Mexico and who have not matriculated.</p>
                    <p>We hold, under the general principles of international law, that the right of
                        an American citizen to claim the protection of his own government while in a
                        foreign land, and the duty of this government to exercise such protection,
                        are reciprocal, and are inherent in the allegiance of the citizen under the
                        constitution of his own land, and that, inasmuch as this reciprocal right on
                        the part of the citizen and duty on the part of his government is not
                        created by the laws of any foreign country, it cannot on the other hand be
                        denied by the municipal law of a foreign state. Holding thus, it is
                        impossible for this government to accept the proposition that its right to
                        intervene for the protection of one of its citizens in Mexico can only begin
                        with, and be created by, the matriculation of such a citizen as a foreign
                        sojourner in Mexico, and can only exist and be exercised with respect to the
                        redress of wrongs which such a citizen may suffer there after his name shall
                        have been inscribed on the books of the foreign office in the city of
                        Mexico.</p>
                    <p>This last statement of the question is not a hypothetical one; it has become
                        expressly enunciated by the Mexican foreign secretary in the ease of your
                        application for the matriculation of American citizens in whose behalf you
                        had intervened.</p>
                    <p>Your own legal knowledge will show you that serious grounds exist in practice
                        for questioning the Mexican contention on this point, even were its justice
                        admitted, which it is not. For an American, say, for instance, a shipmaster
                        in port, charged with some technical offense against the revenue, or
                        arrested through the arbitrary action of an ignorant official, might,
                        although he had no intention of sojourning in Mexico, and when it would not
                        be claimed that there was any necessity for matriculation, be thus brought
                        within Mexican jurisdiction under circumstances calling for the diplomatic
                        intervention of his national protector. Or again, an American citizen when
                        crossing the frontier on a merely temporary errand might be held to military
                        service in the Mexican army and subjected to detention and personal loss and
                        damage, for which, under the decision of Mr. Mariscal he could not claim
                        relief unless armed with a certificate of matriculation obtained before the
                        act complained of. And again, the property rights of an American might
                        possibly be assailed in Mexico while he himself was not within Mexican
                        jurisdiction. I have presented hypothetical cases. Others will occur to you
                        wherein the rigid application of the doctrine enunciated by Mr. Mariscal
                        would operate to bar all intervention for protection or redress.</p>
                    <p>I repeat, the <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of a foreigner is, under
                        international law, inherent, and neither created nor destroyed by Mexican
                        law. The evidence of the foreign <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of an
                        individual consists in the facts as they exist, or by the authentic
                        certification of his own government as in the form of <pb n="396"
                            xml:id="pg_396" facs="0468"/>a passport; it does not originate in
                        compliance with a Mexican municipal statute.</p>
                    <p>I desire that when you have familiarized yourself with the subject in its
                        legal and international aspects, and in view of the precedents furnished by
                        your legation files, you will present the question earnestly to the
                        attention of Mr. Mariscal. In doing so, while your representations will of
                        course be temperate and courteous, you should make it apparent that the
                        United States cannot recognize the fact of matriculation as controlling the
                        right of a citizen of the United States to ask the intervention of this
                        government in case of need.</p>
                    <p>As the treaties between the two countries which express the reciprocal rights
                        and privileges of their citizens in the territories of the other have been
                        terminated recently by the act of Mexico, your arguments must necessarily
                        rest on the principles of international law. In fact, the absence of
                        specific treaty stipulations is quite immaterial; treaties do not create the
                        personal rights of men, they may recognize their existence and define their
                        exercise within certain practical and convenient bounds.</p>
                    <p>You should, further, be careful to dissociate this important subject from the
                        specific case of the Gartrells, or any particular reclamation now pending.
                        Such cases rest on their merits. This matriculation question rests on a
                        higher plane, it concerns our right to protect our citizens by presenting
                        the facts in their cases and asking consideration thereof according to the
                        recognized principles of justice and equity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Mexican Congress opened its regular
                        session on the 16th instant. I transmit herewith a copy and translation of
                        the Presidents message. It is a carefully prepared and able document. The
                        difficulties <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0470"/>between Mexico and
                        Guatemala, it is stated, bid fair to be amicably adjusted.</p>
                    <p>The convention between the United States and Mexico for the reciprocal
                        passing of troops of either nation across the Rio Grande, when in pursuit of
                        hostile Indians, is announced; as also the convention for the appointment of
                        a commission to replace the boundary marks between Mexico and the United
                        States which have been destroyed or removed. And he cites as evidence of the
                        friendly disposition of the United States towards this country the fact that
                        the present administration has notified the Government of Guatemala that the
                        President would not offer to mediate in the question of boundary with Mexico
                        unless with the previous request of both parties; and the consent of the
                        United States Government to the reopening of two cases decided by the mixed
                        commission, in which, as he says, injustice had been done to Mexico.</p>
                    <p>That the best harmony exists between the federal government and the States,
                        although he notices some political disturbances in the States of Jalisco and
                        Zacatecas, the first of which has been settled and the second soon will be.
                        That peace and personal security is enjoyed throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>That the progress of international improvement has been constant and
                        remarkable; noticing that the Central Railroad Company has completed its
                        line to Leon, when it had only contracted to do so by the 31st December,
                        1882, as well as the line from El Paso to Chihuahua; that instead of 400
                        kilometers which it had agreed to complete every two years, more than double
                        the work had been accomplished, and that they had now more than 900
                        kilometers in operation, from which, judging by the past, it may be expected
                        that they will complete their contract long before the time agreed upon.
                        That the “Nation Construction Company” were operating about 500 kilometers
                        of road; the Sonora Company, 300 kilometers; the road from Mexico to “Los
                        Reyes é Isolo,” and from that point to Pueblo, 96 kilometers; the company
                        from Altata to Culiacan, 52; and the San Marcos, 47; in all exceeding 3,000
                        kilometers of road.</p>
                    <p>The forfeiture of the Tehuantepec is noticed.</p>
                    <p>The extension of telegraphic communication has increased 4,000 kilometers,
                        giving now an extent of nearly 4,000 leagues, Mexico being now connected by
                        wire with nearly all the nations of the globe. The effort at colonization is
                        noticed and stated to have been reasonably successful. Uncultivated lands
                        have been entered by 376 parties to an extent covering 294,000 hectares.</p>
                    <p>Schools of theory and practice have been established and plans are being
                        matured for establishing industrial and metallurgy schools and for the
                        forming of a mineral association which is to extend throughout the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Attention is called to the wasteful destruction of timber, and Congress is
                        called on to pass such laws as will protect the forests.</p>
                    <p>The treasury is represented to be in a condition of prosperity heretofore
                        unknown, the revenue collected during the fiscal year which ended on the
                        30th June last, having exceeded $30,000,000, of which $17,000,000 was
                        derived from duties on imports.</p>
                    <p>The expenses of the government have been regularly met, including $8,000,000
                        paid in subsidies to railroad companies. All of which is at tributed to the
                        condition of peace which the country has enjoyed during the last six
                        years.</p>
                    <p>A commission has been established for the purpose of proposing such changes
                        in the tariff laws as the exigencies of the trade seem to require.</p>
                    <p>The operations of the army against the Indians are extolled, and mention <pb
                            n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0471"/>is made of the acknowledgment
                        thereof by our Secretary of War and the General of the Army.</p>
                    <p>The message concludes by expressing the belief that if the affairs of the
                        country continue to prosper in the future as they have during the last few
                        years, that the Mexican people in the year 1921 will celebrate the
                        centennial of their independence with the same legitimate pride that the
                        people of the United States celebrated theirs in 1876.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your excellency’s government, in the
                            correspondence which has taken place between the department for foreign
                            affairs and this legation during several years past, has denied the
                            right of diplomatic intervention in behalf of citizens of the United
                            States who are not matriculated at the foreign office; and has also
                            maintained that matriculation has no retroactive effect, that is, where
                            diplomatic intervention is offered <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400"
                                facs="0472"/>on behalf of a citizen of the United States who is
                            matriculated, if the cause for intervention arose anterior to the
                            matriculation, the intervention will not be admitted.</p>
                        <p>The first part of the proposition I find announced in Señor Avila’s note
                            of my predecessor, Mr. Foster, of the 19th of November, 1878 (case of
                            Emilio Boig), and in your excellency’s note to me of the 12th December,
                            1881 (case of Walter Coffin), and 4th April, 1882 (case of Shields and
                            Weber), 13th April, 1882 (case of Leonard <hi rend="italic">et
                            als</hi>), of the 15th May, 1882 (case of Connelly, Youmans, and
                            Arnold), and of the 16th June, 1882 (case of Thomas Gartrell and
                            wife).</p>
                        <p>I find authority for the second proposition in your note to me on the
                            26th of April, 1882, relating to the case of Patrick and Edward Leonard
                            and others, which, as they are familiar to you, it is not necessary I
                            should do more than refer to them.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will understand that the cases cited in the
                            correspondence referred to, or those which I may hereafter mention in
                            this note, have not been, nor will they be, mentioned with a view of
                            discussing them at this time. They have their own place and opportunity,
                            and stand upon their own merits. This matriculation question rests upon
                            a higher plane than individual cases. It concerns the right of the
                            Government of the United States to protect its citizens by presenting
                            the facts in their cases, and asking consideration thereof according to
                            the recognized principles of justice and equity. I have referred to them
                            here simply for the purpose of stating what I understand to be the
                            ground which your excellency’s government has assumed with reference to
                            diplomatic intervention in behalf of foreigners, viz: That no diplomatic
                            intervention is admissible on behalf of any foreigner who is not
                            registered as such at the department for foreign affairs; that
                            diplomatic intervention will not be admitted on behalf of a foreigner
                            who is matriculated, if the fact upon which intervention is based
                            occurred before the date of his matriculation.</p>
                        <p>The first proposition of your excellency’s government rests, as I
                            understand it, on the 10th article of the decree of the 16th of March,
                            1861, which declares: “Tampoco se admitiza en ninguna de las oficinas de
                            la republica reclamation in gestion alguna de estranjeros, si al hacerla
                            no presentaren el certificado de matricula, del que se tomará razon en
                            el negocio que promuevan.” Which I translate: “Neither shall there be
                            admitted in any offices of the republic any claim or question on the
                            part of foreigners, unless upon making or presenting the same, they
                            present the certificate of matriculation, of which a record shall be
                            made in the papers of the case.</p>
                        <p>The second is based on the second sentence in article 2 of the decree of
                            the 6th of December, 1866, which declares: “En lo que se refiera al
                            tiempo anterior a la fecha en que se inseriban y obtengan el certificado
                            de matricula, no podrán hacer valor ningunos gestiones bajo el carácter
                            de estranjeros.” Which I translate: “So far as refers to the period
                            previous to the date when they were inscribed and obtained the
                            certificate of matriculation, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> shall not
                            enjoy any rights, neither should there be admitted any questions coming
                            from them under the character of foreigners.”</p>
                        <p>An attentive consideration of these two laws has failed to disclose to me
                            anything in either of their sections which denies to a foreign nation or
                            its diplomatic representative the right to interfere on behalf of any
                            citizen or subject of that nation, in case the party on whose behalf
                            intervention is made has not been matriculated.</p>
                        <p>They appear to refer exclusively to individuals in their individual
                            capacity. They are silent as to any action accorded or denied to a
                            foreign nation or to its diplomatic representative. It is a familar rule
                            of construction that what is not expressly included in a law is excluded
                            therefrom, and following this rule, as diplomatic intervention is not
                            mentioned in these laws, I may assume that the omission was intentional
                            on the part of the law maker. If this be so, then the omission cannot be
                            supplied by the ministerial officers of government. The position assumed
                            by your excellency’s government, if this interpretation be a correct
                            one, has, therefore, nothing to rest upon.</p>
                        <p>Should your excellency be of a different opinion, and find in the laws in
                            question ample authority for the ground taken upon the subject before us
                            by your government, then I have to submit that as, under international
                            law, a nation has the right to ask, through its accredited
                            representative, redress for wrongs inflicted upon its citizens or
                            subjects by the illegal acts of the officials of the nation to which he
                            is accredited, it follows that any attempt on the part of a government,
                            in the form of an act of interior legislation, to deprive a nation of
                            this right, and which would, if carried into effect, place the citizens
                            or subjects of other nationalities beyond the protection of their
                            respective governments, is a violation of the law of nations and is
                            consequently null and void.</p>
                        <p>That the legislation in question does deprive citizens of the United
                            States of the protection of their government I shall proceed to show. A
                            citizen of the United States, residing at Brownsville, Tex., crosses
                            over the Rio Bravo to Matamoras for the purposes of business or
                            pleasure, intending to return to his place of residence the same day. As
                            he steps upon Mexican soil, he is taken possession of by a recruiting
                            sergeant of the Mexican army, and forced into the military service of
                            the country. He appeals to this legation for protection. A request is
                            made by it for his release.</p>
                        <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0473"/>
                        <p>Conforming to the opinion which your excellency’s government has, up to
                            now, held, the answer would he that inasmuch as the person in question
                            had not been matriculated, diplomatic intervention in his behalf would
                            not be admitted. And yet this man would have come into Mexico under the
                            guarantees of the Mexican constitution, which permits, nay invites, free
                            entry into its territory by people of other nationalities, and allows
                            them to circulate therein without a passport or any species of
                            safe-conduct. He would, moreover, have been in the physical
                            impossibility of complying with the requirements of the Mexican law upon
                            the subject of matriculation.</p>
                        <p>Should application be made to cause him to be matriculated upon a
                            certificate of American citizenship, if the application was granted (as
                            was done in the case of Patrick Leonard and others, above referred to)
                            and intervention was then attempted in his behalf, the reply would be,
                            as it was in Leonard’s case, a simple reference to article 2 of the
                            decree of the 6th December, 1866.</p>
                        <p>Take another example: An American ship arrives at a Mexican port. Her
                            captain has no intention to remain in Mexico. On the contrary, his
                            interests would require his departure therefrom at as early a date
                            possible. It could scarcely be contended that such a person would need
                            to be matriculated. Should he, while on shore upon business of his ship,
                            be arrested, charged with some technical offense against the revenue, or
                            through the arbitrary action of an official, and should this legation,
                            on being informed of the facts, desire to call your excellency’s
                            attention to the case with the view of obtaining an order for his
                            release, the answer would be that as he was not matriculated diplomatic
                            intervention in his case was not admissible.</p>
                        <p>Again: The constitution of Mexico (article 16, if I am not mistaken)
                            declares that, except in a case arising <hi rend="italic">flagrante
                                delictu</hi>, no person is to be molested in his person, his family,
                            his domicile, papers, or property, except upon a written warrant, issued
                            by a competent authority, in which warrant shall be stated the ground
                            upon which it was issued.</p>
                        <p>The same instrument (article 17) declares that no man is subject to
                            imprisonment for a purely civil debt.</p>
                        <p>By the same charter it is declared (article 19) that no imprisonment can
                            exceed three days except by virtue of a judgment in which the cause of
                            detention is stated.</p>
                        <p>Should either of these contingencies, expressly prohibited by the Mexican
                            constitution, happen to an unmatriculated citizen of the United States,
                            the diplomatic representative of his government, under the doctrine now
                            held by your excellency’s government, would not be conceded the right of
                            calling his attention thereto.</p>
                        <p>The examples which I have cited are not entirely supposititious ones.</p>
                        <p>The intervention of this legation has been refused in cases where
                            citizens of the United States have complained of illegal imprisonment,
                            as in the case of Leonard, Shields, and Coffin. Its intervention has
                            been refused, where it has been offered, in cases where the parties had
                            matriculated after the fact, upon which the intervention had been
                            tendered, had occurred (as in the case of Leonard and others). It has
                            been denied in cases where parties not matriculated, or their
                            representatives, have demanded damages against the Mexican Government,
                            although those claims were presented through this legation, acting under
                            instructions from the Department of State (as in the case of Youmans and
                            others).</p>
                        <p>It has been denied by anticipation, in the case of Thomas Gartrell and
                            wife.</p>
                        <p>It has been denied, as a right, on behalf of citizens of the United
                            States impressed into the Mexican army, as in the case of Emilio Boig,
                            and Felipe Burnato, and others. In the last two cases cited, your
                            excellency’s government informed this legation that the courts of the
                            country were open for the redress of the wrongs of those parties, and
                            that to them application must be made; and it may be suggested that in
                            this respect foreigners are by the laws of Mexico under the protection
                            of the law officers of the Mexican Government to the same extent that
                            Mexicans are. But, in my opinion at least, when a citizen of the United
                            States suffers a wrong at the hands of the officers of a foreign
                            government in whose territory he happens to be, he has the right to have
                            the matter brought by his minister to the notice of such government for
                            redress, and this refused he has the right to demand protection from his
                            own government; nor could that government refuse it to him. It would,
                            under certain circumstances, be the duty of his government to attempt
                            his protection even though he had made no personal application
                            therefor.</p>
                        <p>For example: Should it come to the knowledge of the Department of State
                            that a citizen of the United States had been impressed into the Mexican
                            service and that he was not permitted to hold any communication with the
                            representative of his government, it is certain that the Department of
                            State would immediately direct the United States minister here to bring
                            the matter to the notice of your excellency’s government with the view
                            to his discharge. According to the construction placed on the law under
                            consideration, the case could not be examined because the man was not
                            registered as a foreigner.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will remember that in the correspondence which took place
                            between this legation and the department for foreign affairs, in the
                            case of Emilio Boig, the <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0474"
                            />position was assumed by your excellency’s government that his American
                            citizenship could not be recognized for the reason that his name did not
                            appear on the register of matriculation. The same position was assumed
                            in the case of Felipe Burnato and others.</p>
                        <p>In his note to Señor Avila, of the 23d November, 1878, my predecessor
                            said: “It is my duty, however, without loss of time, to enter my protest
                            against the position assumed by your honor that said Boig is not
                            entitled to be recognized as a citizen of the United States because he
                            is not inscribed in the register of matriculation of the foreign office.
                            I have heretofore notified the department of foreign affairs, and now
                            desire to repeat in an earnest manner, that the Mexican Government
                            cannot by any domestic legislation or regulations denationalize American
                            citizens who may be traveling or resident in the country and who have
                            committed no act to forfeit such citizenship.”</p>
                        <p>And in his note to the same gentleman, of the 30th November, 1878, while
                            acknowledging the discharge of Boig from the army, he felt compelled in
                            reply to the position assumed by Señor Avila, that “while an American
                            citizen in Mexico could not be recognized in that character unless he is
                            inscribed on the register of matriculation in the foreign office, still
                            he is not on that account deprived of his natural and civil rights, for
                            the maintenance of which he can appeal to the courts and other
                            authorities, enjoying the same rights in this respect as Mexican
                            citizens,” to say:</p>
                        <p>“But your honor seems to forget that Mexican citizens are on proper
                            occasions subject to compulsory military service by their own
                            government, while the treaty of 1831 expressly exempts American citizens
                            from such service in Mexico. If, as in the present case, an American
                            recently arrived, traveling from the frontier towards the capital, and
                            before he has any fixed residence of even a temporary character, and
                            hence no opportunity to be matriculated, is seized and placed in the
                            Mexican army by force, he cannot obtain the protection of the treaty of
                            1831, but is to obtain the same treatment from the courts and
                            authorities as Mexican citizens. Mexican citizens are subject to forced
                            military service. Hence for all the purposes of his liberty and national
                            rights, an American citizen circumstanced as above, is denationalized by
                            the operation of the laws and regulations of the Mexican Government
                            relating to matriculation. It was against such an unwarrantable claim
                            that I was forced to enter my protest.”</p>
                        <p>And in a note which I addressed to his honor Señor Fernandez on the 5th
                            November, 1880, in reply to one from him of the 30th October, 1880, both
                            referring to the alleged impressment of certain citizens of the United
                            States into the Mexican army, whose release I had been instructed to ask
                            for, and in which Señor Fernandez had said that the parties on whose
                            behalf I had interposed must seek for relief in the courts of the
                            country, I endeavored to show that his position was untenable and could
                            not, I thought, be acquiesced in by my government, “which is mindful of
                            its obligations towards its citizens, and which owes to them its
                            protection in whatever country they may happen to be.” The argument of
                            my predecessor in the correspondence above quoted from, appears to me
                            unanswerable, and I permit myself to express the conviction that the
                            obligations of my government, as expressed in my note to Señor
                            Fernandez, will never be evaded.</p>
                        <p>Even if I admit, then, that citizens of the United States who may be
                            impressed into the military service of Mexico would be in the same
                            position before the courts that citizens of Mexico under the same
                            circumstances would be, it follows that this protection would not under
                            all circumstances suffice them, as citizens of Mexico are, under certain
                            circumstances, as has been already stated, liable to enforced military
                            duty, while citizens of the United States, temporarily in Mexico, are
                            not.</p>
                        <p>If the courts of the country are open to a foreigner placed in such
                            circumstances, as it is claimed they are, I think I am not going too far
                            when I say that a judgment of a court in his favor might turn out to be
                            illusory; for, unless I have been greatly misinformed, it has happened,
                            and that quite recently, that a judgment of a competent tribunal which
                            ordered the discharge of a Mexican citizen from service in the Mexican
                            army, into which service he had, as found by the courts, been illegally
                            impressed, was refused execution by the officer in command of the
                            barracks in which, in the opinion of the court, he was illegally
                            detained. If this can be successfully done against a citizen of Mexico,
                            it cannot be hoped that a citizen of the United States would, under the
                            same circumstances, be more fortunate. And yet, in a case such as this,
                            if the unfortunate man had from accident, or the impossibility of
                            complying with the law, and after he had exhausted in vain the remedies
                            allowed by Mexican law, should apply to the minister of his country for
                            relief, that official would not be listened to, because as the man had
                            not matriculated as a foreigner, diplomatic intervention in his behalf
                            is not admissible. It cannot, it appears to me, be expected that the
                            Government of the United Sates could withhold its protection to one of
                            its citizens who should find himself in so unhappy a position as this. I
                            am not unmindful of the fact that, in both the cases of alleged
                            impressment which has been the subject of correspondence between this
                                <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0475"/>legation and the department
                            for foreign affairs, the first party was liberated from personal
                            consideration for my predecessor’s request, and that in respect of the
                            latter four, three had been discharged, and one had escaped from the
                            Mexican army, before your attention had been called to their case.</p>
                        <p>But the rights of citizens of the United States abroad do not depend upon
                            mere courtesy, or upon the spontaneous act of justice of a government
                            official. By another the courtesy may be omitted, the act of justice go
                            unperformed. What his government has a right to expect in such a case is
                            that justice be rendered to him according to the law of nations, applied
                            for in the mode recognized by the law of nations. Neither have I lost
                            sight of the fact that when the correspondence upon this subject took
                            place the treaty of 1831 was in force, and that that treaty, by
                            denouncement of the Mexican Government, no longer exists. But the
                            reciprocal rights of citizens of a friendly nation, who happen to be in
                            the territory of the other, do not rest entirely upon treaties. In fact,
                            as your excellency knows, treaties do not create the personal rights of
                            men, although they may recognize their existence and define their
                            exercise within certain practical and convenient bounds. In this regard
                            they are protected by the comity of nations; and the right, nay the
                            duty, of their government to ask, and to see to it to the extent of its
                            power, that the rule of the comity of nations be applied to them, in
                            whatever position of danger they may be placed by the wrongful acts of
                            the officers of the government of the country in which they may find
                            themselves, cannot, I think, be seriously questioned; nor, can the
                            denial of the right be justified, on the ground that it is not admitted
                            by a local law.</p>
                        <p>Again: Mexican law recognizes diplomatic intervention in judicial
                            proceedings, where there has been a denial of justice.</p>
                        <p>One phase of a denial of justice is the failure of the judge to decide a
                            case which has been submitted to him.</p>
                        <p>Suppose a citizen of the United States, who resides in the United States
                            and who has never been in Mexico, to be a creditor of a citizen of
                            Mexico. He institutes suit against his debtor in the courts of Mexico.
                            The judge before whom the suit is instituted refuses or neglects to
                            decide, until refusal or neglect becomes a denial of justice. After
                            having exhausted in vain every means within his reach to obtain a
                            decision he appeals for diplomatic intervention. The reply would be that
                            as he is not matriculated diplomatic intervention in his behalf is not
                            to be admitted; and yet the man would never have been where
                            matriculation was necessary or possible to him. The same may be said
                            with reference to a foreign creditor of the Mexican Government. If the
                            judge before whom he has to present his complaint refuses to give him an
                            audience, he is entirely powerless, under the position assumed by your
                            excellency’s government. The admission on the part of the Mexican
                            Government that a person is a citizen of the United States, does not
                            make him a citizen thereof, nor does his failure to matriculate take
                            away his citizenship. This <hi rend="italic">status</hi> does not
                            depend, or the right which he has of asking for the protection of his
                            government upon his compliance with the requirements of the legislation
                            of a foreign country, but upon his own. This citizenship follows him
                            into whatever country he may go, and the duty of his government to
                            protect him so long as he does nothing to forfeit his citizenship
                            accompanies him.</p>
                        <p>This duty his government must discharge, and it could not, if it would,
                            be relieved therefrom by the fact that the municipal law of the country
                            where he happens to be has seen fit to provide under what circumstances
                            he is permitted to appear, as a foreigner, before the authorities of the
                            country. Such a law cannot touch his government for governments are
                            bound only by treaties, or in their absence by the law of nations, and
                            there is nothing in that law which recognizes in one nation the right,
                            by the enactment of a municipal law, to say how, or when, or under what
                            circumstances another government may, or may not, ask justice in behalf
                            of one of its citizens or subjects.</p>
                        <p>In any discussion arising diplomatically between the United States and
                            any other country with reference to the rights of a citizen of the
                            former, how could that government accept the answer that a citizen was
                            not entitled to its protection, in case of need, simply because he had
                            not complied with a mere internal regulation of the country in which he
                            happened to be?</p>
                        <p>And here I have to call your excellency’s attention to the fact that if
                            the doctrine asserted by the Mexican Government be admitted, Mexico has
                            possessed herself of the power to prevent diplomatic interference in
                            behalf of foreigners.</p>
                        <p>For as the right of foreign governments to interpose depends upon the
                            fact of matriculation, and as matriculation is an act of officials of
                            the Mexican Government, to compel the performance of which is not within
                            the competence of a foreign power, it follows that a Mexican official
                            has only to refuse or neglect to perform his duty to make diplomatic
                            intervention in behalf of a foreigner impossible.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States cannot consent to allow its citizens
                            to be placed in such a position. I am not, and as I understand it my
                            government is not, disposed to question the right of Mexico, as a mere
                            convenience to herself, to require of every citizen of the United States
                            who comes to Mexico that he should enroll himself <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0476"/>as such, although this should, it
                            appears to me, be qualified by time, place, and circumstances. This is a
                            matter of internal police, the failure to comply with which might entail
                            upon the delinquent himself certain inconveniences and penalties, but it
                            would not make him any the less a citizen of the United States, nor
                            relieve his government from the obligation, the case arising, to afford
                            him its protection, which protection, in the first instance at least,
                            can only be asked for through the diplomatic representative of his
                            country. Because he happens to have neglected to comply with what at
                            most is a mere police regulation, it does not follow that the laws and
                            comity of nations may be violated in his person, and his government be
                            without authority to call attention to such violation according to the
                            methods of the law of nations, viz, through its diplomatic
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>The general principles of international law, that the rights of an
                            American citizen to claim the protection of his own government while in
                            a foreign land, and the duty of his government to exercise such
                            protection, are reciprocal and are inherent in the allegiance of the
                            citizen under the constitution of his own land; and inasmuch as this
                            reciprocal right on the part of the citizen and duty on the part of his
                            government is not created by the laws of any foreign country, it cannot
                            on the other hand be denied by the municipal law of a foreign state. The
                                <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of a foreigner is, under international
                            law, inherent, and neither created nor destroyed by Mexican law.</p>
                        <p>The general principles of international law, also, insure to foreigners
                            hospitable treatment and kindly usage from the authorities of the
                            country in which they happen to be, and the duty rests upon their
                            government to see that these laws are not violated in their person. The
                            Mexican law in question which has the effect to deprive a citizen of the
                            United States of the right to the protection of his government is, in my
                            judgment, as I have heretofore stated, contrary to the law of nations,
                            and is therefore not obligatory upon it. The question, the discussion of
                            which I have now brought to an end, is one of grave and serious import.
                            It has been thoroughly and seriously considered by my government. It is,
                            happily, one of the few outstanding ones between the two governments,
                            and, in my opinion at least, it is the most important one of them all.
                            For this reason, I have endeavored to show your excellency— <list>

                            interview which I had on Thursday last with the Acting Secretary of
                            State (on which occasion, while alluding to the movements of Indians in
                            Arizona, I spoke to him of the result which usually follows the
                            operations of the United States troops against the savage tribes, which
                            is that the latter simply transfer the scene of their depredations to
                            Mexican territory), I herewith inclose a telegram (original) which I
                            have just received from the Mexican consul at Tucson, whereby it will be
                            seen that my fears are on the point of being realized. This induces me
                            to refer to my verbal statements, and to ask that the attention of the
                            War Department may be called to the fact to which I have above adverted,
                            to the end that every practicable means may be adopted for the
                            punishment and destruction of the rebel bands before they cross the
                            dividing line between the two republics.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary</hi>: The accompanying extracts,
                            copied from an Arizona newspaper, corroborate the statements which I
                            have had the honor to make to the Department of State, both verbally and
                            in writing, in regard to the state of insecurity which prevails on that
                            portion of the frontier, and from which the adjacent districts of Mexico
                            are sufferers.</p>
                        <p>The note with which the Department of State was pleased to honor me on
                            the 29th of August last convinces me that the evil in question is not a
                            matter of indifference to the Department of State, and I therefore lay
                            before it the inclosed data, availing myself of the opportunity to
                            express the hope that the Department will, when it shall have received
                            information thereof, communicate to this legation the result of the
                            steps taken by it with a view to securing the restoration of order in
                            those frontier districts in which lawlessness has become most
                            prevalent.</p>

                            <p>* * * It is a well-known fact that in the southeastern part of this
                                county there is a hand of desperadoes variously estimated at from
                                fifty to one hundred men, whose crimes have deserved the severest
                                penalties, and yet we hear of no effort for their capture. It is
                                true their depredations have been committed principally upon
                                citizens of our sister republic, but that is no reason why they
                                should go unpunished.</p>
                            <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                            <p>News was brought to town yesterday of further depredations by a party
                                of five men, who are supposed to belong to the gang of outlaws
                                infesting this county calling themselves “Rustlers.” They are
                                principally from Western Texas and Lincoln Co., New Mexico, from
                                whence they have been driven by an outraged community, and now seem
                                to have found the place they long have sought, where they can commit
                                their depredations without fear of arrest. For a long time this gang
                                have committed crimes and confined themselves and their operations
                                to the east of Tombstone, and along the line of Sonora, but seeing
                                that no steps were taken for their arrest they have become
                                emboldened to take up their haunts and perpetrate their depredations
                                nearer the center of business and population.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my note to
                            you of August 29 last, relative to the unfortunate condition of affairs
                            existing on both sides of the border, and beg to invite your attention
                            particularly to the circumstances of your complaint of the hanging of
                            José Ordiña, a Mexican citizen, by certain residents of Arizona, for
                            horse stealing, having recently received a letter upon that subject from
                            Mr. John J. Gosper, acting governor of that Territory.</p>
                        <p>In furtherance of the Department’s request to ascertain the facts
                            connected with the hanging of the individual referred to, Mr. Gosper
                            called in person upon the Mexican consul at Tucson to obtain from him
                            directly everything in relation to the deplorable circumstance.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the only information the consul possessed upon the
                            subject was derived, first, from a lady who wrote him at the time of the
                            occurrence; and second, from Mr. Paul, the sheriff of Pima County, a
                            copy of whose letter to the Mexican consul at Tucson accompanies your
                            note of August 8, 1881.</p>
                        <p>A personal interview was also had with Mr. Paul, who was requested to
                            narrate all the facts as far as he was familiar with them. “His
                            statement to me, by word of mouth,” adds Mr. Gosper, “was substantially
                            as stated in his communication to the consul of Mexico, with the
                            additional statement, that the citizens of the Gila whose horses had
                            been stolen were as certain that the two men whom they had captured were
                            regular horse thieves as though they had been tried in court and
                            regularly proven as such; that they did not intend to take the life of
                            Ordiña, only intending to let him hang long enough to compel him to give
                            information of the whereabouts of the stolen animals, and by mistake let
                            him hang too long.” Mr. Gosper states, also, that he learned from other
                            credible sources that the two Mexicans adverted to as in part the
                            subject of the Department’s correspondence were, without doubt, habitual
                            thieves.</p>
                        <p>While admitting to the Mexican consul the illegal and unfortunate
                            circumstance of the hanging of one of these men without due process of
                            law, yet it appears from the acting governor’s communication that the
                            consul agreed with him that the two men in question were probably
                            outlaws, and that even if the persons connected with the hanging of one
                            of them were to be arraigned before a court of justice it was doubtful
                            if there could be found a witness to appear before the magistrate to
                            testify against them.</p>
                        <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>The consul was assured by Mr. Gosper that in the event of further
                            knowledge upon the subject coming to him he would promptly act in the
                            interest of peace and the enforcement of the law.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it seems not inappropriate to include, for your
                            further information, two paragraphs from Mr. Gosper’s letter to me upon
                            the general subject of plunder and lawlessness on both sides of the
                            border, believing, as I do, that, coming from such a source, they will
                            not only serve to dispel all idea that the prevailing condition of
                            things may be directly attributable to the acts of American citizens
                            alone, but will suffice to convince you of the actual situation of
                            affairs in that quarter, in which your own citizens are not infrequently
                            prominently concerned.</p>
                        <p>I quote from the letter of Mr. Gosper, who states as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>While it is true Americans on our side of the line dividing the
                                    United States from Mexico are often guilty of murder and theft
                                    upon citizens of Mexico, it is equally true that Mexicans on
                                    their side of said line are equally guilty with Americans in the
                                    matter of murder and theft; and until recently, since the
                                    cow-boy combination along the borders for plunder, the crimes
                                    committed against the citizens of both the Governments of the
                                    United States and Mexico along the border were, in most part,
                                    committed by citizens of Mexico.</p>
                                <p>While the local and general civil authorities of both governments
                                    should be active and earnest in enforcing the laws, I think the
                                    civil authorities of the Government of Mexico are sometimes
                                    perhaps more sensitive over crimes committed by Americans than
                                    the circumstances in particular cases would justify. Mere rumor
                                    and false statements often, for a time, create an uneasiness
                                    which a knowledge of the facts quickly dispels.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I beg to repeat what must be already known to you, that
                            the Department has uniformly given to your several complaints in
                            relation to the border difficulties every possible attention, and has
                            sought upon each occasion the co-operation of the competent officers of
                            this government to remedy, as far as may lie in their power, the evils
                            complained of. I shall do so in the present instance, in view of the
                            statements contained in Mr. Gosper’s letter; and in connection with the
                            general subject of our border troubles, it gives me pleasure to inclose
                            herewith for your information a copy of a letter from the Secretary of
                            War of the 1st instant, from which it appears that all proper assistance
                            will be given by his department to effect a better and more satisfactory
                            condition of affairs in that section.</p>
                        <p>I can confidently assure you of the desire of the general government to
                            suppress all unlawful disturbances and maintain a proper respect for law
                            and order on the border, and that it will willingly pursue such means as
                            may be found practicable to obtain that result.</p>
                        <p>Believing, as I do, therefore, that, recognizing the necessity for
                            increased vigilance on the part of the Mexican authorities in that
                            quarter, that you will not fail to impress this upon your government in
                            order that it may adopt and vigorously prosecute all possible measures
                            calculated to insure that desirable end, and regretting deeply the act
                            by which a citizen of your government lost his life in Arizona,</p>
                        <p>I beg, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary</hi>: The consul of Mexico at Tucson,
                            Ariz., has reported to my government that the Chiricahua Indians who
                            escaped from the San Carlos Reservation have invaded the districts of
                            Ures, Arispe, and others of the State of Sonora, and have committed
                            certain depredations, of which, in their turn, report has been made by
                            the authorities of those districts.</p>
                        <p>In a dispatch which I have just received from the office of foreign

                            redoubling vigilance over the Indian reserves in that part of the

                            your legation relative to depredations in the State of Sonora, by
                            Indians from the San Carlos Reservation, I have now much pleasure in

                            will be observed, from these papers, that every possible effort for the
                            prevention of similar occurrences in the future will be taken by the
                            officers of this government, and it is earnestly hoped that the
                            authorities of Mexico on the border will facilitate the successful
                            prosecution of every proper measure adopted to that end.</p>

                            Zamacona, late Mexican minister at this capital, in relation to
                            depredations alleged to have been committed by Chiricahua Indians
                            escaping from San Carlos Reservation, and in reply respectfully invite

                            Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to whom the subject was referred.</p>
                        <p>Especial attention is requested to that portion of the Commissioner’s
                            communication (upon page 2) referring to efforts formerly made by this
                            government for the removal from Mexican soil of certain Indians
                            belonging on this side, but who had gained an asylum in the States of
                            Sonora and Chihuahua, in the Republic of Mexico, and the cause of the

                            department reference, of a communication from the honorable Secretary of
                            State, dated 1st instant, in which he incloses note from Mr. Zamacona,
                            the late Mexican minister at this capital, in which he reports
                            depredations in the State of Sonora by the Chiricahua Indians who
                            escaped from the San Carlos Reservation, and asks, pursuant to the
                            instructions of his government, that renewed vigilance be exerted in
                            that quarter to prevent similar occurrences in future.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to state that it has been the aim of this
                            office to fully and heartily co-operate with the Mexican authorities in
                            any and all efforts that might be made to put a stop to raiding of
                            renegades upon the border.</p>
                        <p>The agents at San Carlos and Mescalero have recently been instructed with
                            reference to this matter. A copy of Mr. Zamacona’s note will be
                            forwarded to them, with instructions to redouble their efforts to
                            prevent the trouble complained of. The San Carlos agent has been
                            authorized to employ an additional force of thirty scouts.</p>
                        <p>In this connection permit me to express the belief that the Indians
                            mentioned in the note of Mr. Zamacona do not all belong to reservations
                            under the supervision of this bureau. The attention of the department
                            has heretofore been called to the fact that the Lipans and other
                            renegade bands from Mexico have for many years been engaged in marauding
                            expeditions upon the border, committing serious depredations against our
                            citizens in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and after being trailed by
                            our troops across the line have found an asylum in the border States of
                            Mexico and a ready market for their plunder. It is true that some of
                            these renegades formerly belonged to our reservations, and to effect
                            their return large appropriations have been made by Congress, and
                            special agents have been sent to Mexico to conduct them back to their
                            reservations, but these efforts were not wholly successful, owing to the
                            opposition of the local authorities there and to that of interested
                            parties who, our agents state, “induced them to remain in Mexico for the
                            purpose of carrying on trade with them for stolen property.”</p>
                        <p>It, however, has been, and will continue to be, the aim of this bureau to
                            adopt the most efficient measures to arrest and bring to justice all
                            classes of Indian renegades and outlaws, without regard to nationality
                            or tribe, who commit their forays upon Indians and law-abiding citizens
                            upon both sides of the border.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully suggest that the State Department be advised of the action
                            of this office respecting the Indians herein referred to.</p>

                            Department of State of the United States relative to the depredations of
                            cattle thieves from the United States in the frontier States of Mexico,
                            I now have the honor to send you a letter written by J. W. Evans, esq.,
                            United States marshal for Arizona Territory, dated October 12, 1881, and
                            addressed to the Hon. Luis E. Torres, governor of the State of Sonora.
                            This letter contains important revelations with regard to the robberies
                            committed in the State of Sonora by the cowboys residing in Arizona
                            Territory, which robberies have thus far not been checked by the United
                            States authorities in that Territory, according to the statement of the
                            United States marshal, who says that this fact is due to the lack of
                            adequate instructions from the Department of Justice at Washington.</p>
                        <p>Believing that the United States Government is sincerely desirous to put
                            an end to these outrages, I do not doubt that it will redouble its
                            efforts for the apprehension and punishment of the Indians and
                            plunderers on the frontier, and that suitable instructions to that end
                            will be issued by the Department of Justice to its officers in that
                            locality.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of instructions received from the Mexican Government, I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: As you are en route to the Eastern
                            States, and the opportunity will probably present itself for you to
                            represent to the proper authorities the great and irreparable injury the
                            people of Sonora, Mexico, are suffering, and have been for more than a
                            year past, at the hands of marauders invading Sonora from Arizona, I
                            hope you will fully explain to your representatives the deplorable
                            lawless condition of affairs existing on our border. It is my belief
                            that the authorities at Washington have not been informed as to the
                            magnitude of the depredations being constantly committed in Sonora by a
                            band of marauders styling themselves cowboys, and making their
                            headquarters in Sonora. There are two hundred to three hundred of these
                            cowboys thoroughly organized, armed, and equipped. Our office can do
                            nothing towards suppressing the raiding of these cowboys, unless special
                            instructions are received from the Department of Justice in Washington,
                            D. C. As I greatly desire that good feeling be maintained between Sonora
                            and Arizona, I sincerely hope that the authorities at Washington may be
                            induced to take immediate steps for the suppression of these marauders.
                            Wishing you a pleasant trip and safe return,</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: In reply to your letter of the
                                25th instant, I would state that I had just returned from Janos,
                                Mexico, when I sent the telegram from Major Zimplean whom I left at
                                Janos on the 22d instant; in regard to the Indians, it appears th
                                about the 15th or 16th of this month they stole ninety head of
                                horses and mules from the Corralitos Ranch; they also stole about
                                twelve head from around the town of Janos. A day or two after they
                                stole the animals from the Corralitos Ranch they sent in a squaw on
                                one of the stolen animals for the purpose of having a peace talk, so
                                Major Zimpleman took her and kept her prisoner, and sent word to the
                                Indians that he would keep her till they brought in the horses and
                                mules they had stolen from him; instead of doing what he requested
                                of them, they went to his sheep herds and took a lot of his sheep,
                                and took four of his sheep-herders prisoners; the next day he, Ju,
                                let one of the herders come into [town] to tell the president
                                (mayor) of the town that if the squaw belonging to his tribe was not
                                brought to a place known as Casas de Janos (about 16 miles south of
                                Janos), that he would kill the other three sheep-herders that he
                                held as prisoners; so the president immediately sent a courier to
                                Casas Grandes informing the “gefe politico” (county judge) of the
                                fact; the gefe politico at once ordered the squaw brought to Janos,
                                and with about 100 citizens and about 30 soldiers who were stationed
                                there went up to where the Indians were, and exchanged the squaw for
                                the three herders, at which meeting Maj. Geo. B. Zimpleman and his
                                man Jack Lyle, were present—I failed to get there in time, but I got
                                within a mile of the meeting, and could see what was going on very
                                plainly with my field-glass—who told me all about it, and Jack Lyle
                                smoked the pipe of peace with Jú; they informed me that there were
                                about 30 Indians present at the meeting and that the chiefs Jú,
                                Chind, Chise, Geronimo, and some other chief was present at the
                                meeting; also that they promised to meet Major Zimpleman, the gefe
                                politico, and the people the next day at a place called the Ties
                                Alamos, about 3 or 4 miles nearer Janos; so I went up there the next
                                day with one of my men and joined Zimpleman and four others; we all
                                went to the designated spot and made our “smokes,” the sign for a
                                meeting, but no Indians came; so we came to the conclusion that they
                                thought we meant to be treacherous with them (as the Mexicans of
                                Janos have several times got them in for a peace talk and murdered
                                them, Jú’s band).</p>
                            <p>I then returned to Janos, leaving Zimpleman and Jack Lyle in his
                                sheep camps, where he had been for several days previous; on my
                                return to Janos I learned that the Indians had come within a few
                                miles of the town, sent up their sign of a meeting (smoke), and sent
                                in two squaws with ten animals—horses and mules—that had been stolen
                                from Janos, which was a fact, as I saw the two squaws and talked
                                with one of them who talks Spanish very well, and who was sent in to
                                do the talking, the other one being one of Ju’s wives (I learn he
                                has three wives). So I wrote to Major Zimpleman to come to town at
                                once; he did so the next morning, and we had a talk with the old
                                squaw. She said they would bring Zimpleman’s horses and mules in to
                                Coralitos in a few days; so I left that day, March 22, after having
                                dinner at 1 p.m. with Zimpleman and Rafael Ancheta. I would further
                                state that I talked with one of the sheep herders who had been a
                                prisoner, and he told me that they had a very large rancheria with a
                                large lot of stock; that he should judge at least 300 Indians in
                                all, men, women, and children. After close questioning, he gave as
                                his opinion that there were at least 100 warriors. I believe I have
                                written you about all the main points you wished to know. In
                                conclusion would state I went down there after my stolen horses;
                                that I recovered all my stock in Janos, Mexico, arrested the thief,
                                and took two other animals and a wagon, besides all his personal
                                property, and left him there in the guard-house with the civil
                                officers, who promised me they would keep him safe till I got papers
                                of extradition to bring him to the United States.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General</hi>: Reports, which appear to be
                                reliable, have reached me that a large band of Indians who are said
                                to have committed depredations in Sonora have recently made their
                                appearance near Janos. If this is true, and it is the intention af
                                the military authorities of Mexico to proceed against them in order
                                to punish their past offenses, will you be kind enough to inform me
                                that I may have troops in position to follow them should they
                                attempt to return to this side of the line. Should they be defeated
                                by Mexican troops near Janos, these Indians will, without doubt,
                                either retreat south to the rough mountains of the Sierra Madre, or,
                                if your troops have, as I hope, the good fortune to beat them badly,
                                will attempt to get back to the San Carlos Agency in Arizona, in
                                which case I trust that my troops may be enabled to punish them
                                still further.</p>

                                receipt of copy of a communication from the late Mexican minister at
                                Washington reporting depredations in the State of Sonora by the
                                Chiricahua Indians who escaped from the San Carlos Reservation, and
                                asking that renewed vigilance be exerted in that quarter to prevent
                                similar occurrence in future, and also reply of the War Department
                                thereto, dated March 6, 1882, forwarded by your indorsement of the
                                15th instant; and in answer thereto, I herewith inclose copy of my
                                instructions, of the 17th instant, to the commanding general
                                Department of Arizona on the subject.</p>
                            <p>I call attention to the fact, that our troops were in close pursuit
                                of these Chiricahuas when they crossed into Mexico, greatly
                                crippled, and that the commanding officer was prepared and desired
                                to continue the pursuit across the boundary line, but was prevented
                                from so doing by the protest of the Mexican authorities.</p>
                            <p>Had the Mexican troops taken up the pursuit of these savages when
                                they first entered Mexican territory, or had the military
                                authorities permitted our troops to continue operations against
                                these Indians instead of protesting against their crossing the
                                boundary line, even to get water, the request of the Mexican
                                Government for redoubled vigilance on the part of the United States
                                military authorities to prevent the repetition of incursions would
                                come with more force.</p>
                            <p>I may be pardoned for saying that newspaper reports received here
                                stated that the Mexican authorities tried to make a treaty with
                                these Indians, and it was only after their endeavor in that respect
                                had failed, and after the Indians had repeated in Sonora their
                                murders and outrages, that the Mexican troops were sent in pursuit
                                of them.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In reply to your telegram of the 15th
                                instant, the division commander directs me to say that he thinks you
                                should be the judge of what troops you can spare from Forts Apache
                                and Thomas in the present quiet condition of the Indians on the San
                                Carlos Reservation. But he also thinks if you can afford to take any
                                troops from those posts you should not send them to Grant, but
                                station them on the border, one troop at Huachuca, to replace
                                Wagner’s, of the First Cavalry, and one at Camp Rucker. In a few
                                weeks the troops at Huachuca will be able to get to Willcox Station
                                or any place on the railroad sooner than they would from Grant, and
                                certainly, to keep the peace on the border and satisfy the
                                reasonable wishes of the people of the Territory and carry out the
                                instructions of the Secretary of War, the new camp at Rucker should
                                be as large as you can possibly make it. The division commander,
                                therefore, directs that any troops which you can relieve from Apache
                                and Thomas be sent into camp at Rucker and Huachuca. With the two
                                camps, each of two troops, and one company of infantry and one of
                                Indian scouts, with a camp of observation with some scouts between
                                these posts, and one to the east of Rucker, patrolling the border,
                                the earliest information of Indians entering the Territory would be
                                obtained. In case of any Indians <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418"
                                    facs="0490"/>making away from San Carlos Reservation the troops
                                at these camps would he in the best position to intercept them.</p>
                            <p>Of course these camps should be connected by telegraph or a system of
                                seen signal stations with the general military telegraph system of
                                the department, and that without delay.</p>
                            <p>The question of transportation will be but little affected by the
                                change of station of troops. The transportation made necessary by
                                the new camp at Rucker will be offset by the less demand for
                                transportation at posts from which the troops at the camp came. But
                                aside from this, should the reduction of your public transportation
                                by one-fifth take place, there is no difficulty to be anticipated
                                about supplying the troops at the new camp by contractors’
                                transportation. An additional object for getting a command at an
                                early day at or near the permanent site of the new post near Rucker
                                is that a reservation of suitable size, embracing wood for building
                                and fuel, with grass, and a rifle range, may be set aside and
                                surveyed before the occupation of the country by settlers and before
                                the building timber is claimed.</p>
                            <p>The fact that the troops may be obliged to make a temporary camp near
                                water, instead of occupying at once the site which is selected for
                                the new post, is a matter which should not be taken into
                                consideration as affecting the movement of the troops intended for
                                the new post.</p>
                            <p>The division commander in presenting these views looks forward to the
                                early abandonment of both Forts Grant and Bowie, especially the
                                former, and the concentration of so much of their garrisons at
                                Rucker and Huachuca as will make each a four-company post—three
                                troops of cavalry and one company of infantry. These large posts
                                will necessarily compel the Mexican Government to build large posts
                                near the northern border, perhaps on the Blackwater and at San Luis
                                Springs.</p>
                            <p>If, in addition to these posts, the General of the Army recommends a
                                large post in New Mexico, near Deming, their several garrisons will
                                present great obstacles to any formidable raids from Mexico, and
                                should be able to prevent the raiders from doing any considerable
                                damage in Arizona and from escaping.</p>

                                laid at the rate of 1½ miles a day.</p>

                                communication from the Mexican minister, reporting depredations in

                                that I have been in person to that reservation, as also on the
                                Mexican border; that since October, 1881, there have been no Indians
                                from the San Carlos Reservation in Mexico; that the Chiricahuas who
                                then escaped fled from a supposed personal danger, and are now in
                                Mexico, but that the Mexican military authorities were unwilling to
                                permit our troops to pursue and capture them, expressing their
                                ability to take care of them, and that since, up to the present
                                moment, effectual measures have been taken by the military
                                authorities of the United States to prevent any similar

                                booty, which consisted of horses and mules. They also took from them
                                seventy-five dead bodies and twenty-eight wounded women. Some of the
                                Indians escaped, fleeing in the direction of Casas Grandes.</p>

                            Chiricahua Indians into the territory of Mexico, and stated that you had
                            transmitted it to the Secretary of War, whose reply you would
                            communicate to me as soon as you should have received it.</p>
                        <p>The secretary of foreign relations of the United States of Mexico informs

                            day of May, in San Diego’s woods, the Indians losing thirty-six killed

                            the troops took from them. The remainder of the band dispersed in the

                            Tombstone, Arizona Territory, June 17, 1882, to the effect that four
                            cow-boys came to that place on the 10th instant from the Sonora
                            frontier, having with them a hundred head of cattle which they left at a
                            ranch situated in Saint Peter’s Valley, about sixteen miles from
                            Tombstone; that they remained at Tombstone five days, selling the cattle
                            there to butchers who deal in animals clandestinely brought from Sonora;
                            and that they then left the aforesaid ranch, going in the direction of
                            Sonora.</p>
                        <p>Persons who saw the cattle think that they were from various Mexican
                            ranches situated near the American frontier, in the districts of
                            Magdalena and Arizpe.</p>
                        <p>The person who furnishes this information is of the opinion that it will
                            be no easy matter to bring these cattle-thieves to justice, or even to
                            secure evidence of the thefts, inasmuch as the authorities of Arizona
                            Territory are intimidated by the thieves, some of them even being in
                            collusion with the latter.</p>
                        <p>Thinking it proper that you should be informed of these facts, in order
                            that the United States Government may take such measures as it may think
                            proper for their prevention in future, I have decided to communicate

                            May, informing you that the basis proposed by Mexico for the reciprocal
                            passage of troops across the frontier in pursuit of rebellious Indians
                            was acceptable to the General of the Army of the United States and to
                            the Secretary of War.</p>
                        <p>As I informed you in the interview which I had with you to-day at the
                            Department of State, I have received a telegram from the Secretary of
                            Foreign Relations of Mexico, dated June 30, in which he tells me that
                            the Mexican government does not consider that your aforesaid note
                            implies the acceptance of the conditions proposed by Mexico in May last
                            to the minister of the United States in that city.</p>
                        <p>As, in my opinion, the Government of the United States accepted the
                            conditions proposed by Mexico from the moment that you addressed to me
                            your aforesaid note of June 6, 1882, I will thank you to be pleased to
                            rectify this point if you have no objections (in order to settle this
                            matter,) by informing me whether the note in question comprises the
                            acceptances of said proposals, or simply expresses the opinion that they
                            are acceptable.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your note
                            of the 3d instant, in which, referring to the notes exchanged between us
                            on the 6th ultimo, touching an understanding for the reciprocal pursuit
                            of rebellious and marauding Indians across the frontier, you acquaint me
                            with the doubt which subsists in the mind of the Mexican Secretary of
                            Foreign Relations as to whether my note of June 6, ultimo, comprised the
                            acceptance of the proposition of Mexico for the reciprocal passage of
                            troops across <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0498"/>the frontier, or
                            simply expressed the opinion that the bases proposed are acceptable.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have the pleasure to inform you that the opinion you express,
                            that “the Government of the United States accepted the conditions
                            proposed by Mexico from the moment that [I] addressed to [you my]
                            aforesaid note of June 6, 1882,” is correct, and that it was my
                            intention in that note to accept the bases of the Mexican proposition in
                            order that the arrangement for the reciprocal crossing of the frontier
                            by the respective troops of the United States and Mexico in pursuit of
                            marauding and hostile Indians might be thenceforth effective.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to lay before you a copy
                            of a letter with its accompanying papers addressed to me by his
                            excellency Governor F. A. Tritle, of Arizona Territory, in relation to
                            the arrest and expulsion from Mexican territory of Capt. William J.
                            Ross, a deputy sheriff of Pima County, and his sworn posse, by order of
                            General Bernardo Reyes, of Sonora, on the 5th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>It appears from these papers that, in consequence of the perpetration of
                            certain murders in Arizona by hostile Apaches, their pursuit was
                            instituted by a body of men acting as sheriff’s aids under Captain Ross;
                            that the fugitives were followed to the Mexican line, where they were
                            surrounded by Mexican forces; that, on the invitation of their
                            commander, Captain Ross and his posse aided the Mexican forces; that
                            Captain Ross, having due warrants for the arrest of the fugitives, sent
                            forward a letter, by a courier, to General Terrazas, commanding in
                            Chihuahua, whither the hostiles fled, asking for their delivery to him;
                            that the courier was arrested by General Reyes, whose command was in
                            Sonora, and the letter of Captain Ross to General Terrazas thus failed
                            to reach its destination; and that soon afterwards Ross himself and all
                            his posse were arrested by General Reyes, their arms taken from them,
                            and they themselves ordered to return to Arizona, which they did,
                            unarmed, after a trying march of some hundreds of miles.</p>
                        <p>In view of these circumstances, Governor Tritle makes the very reasonable
                            request that the arms taken from Ross and his posse (and for which the
                            governor holds General Bernardo Reyes’ receipt) be returned to the
                            authorities of the Territory of Arizona, whose property they are. It has
                            seemed to me that I might more promptly, and with less of formality,
                            compass the desired relief through your intervention with the military
                            authorities of Sonora than by formal representations through the United
                            States legation at the city of Mexico. And, with this desire to dispose
                            of the matter frankly and amicably, I refrain from any criticism of
                            General Reyes’ course in disarming, and exposing to the dangers of a
                            tedious march through wild country, a body of men on a mission of
                            justice and good will.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased, &amp;c.,</p>

                                J. Ross, a deputy sheriff of Pima County, and captain of militia of
                                Arizona Territory, by General Bernardo Reyes, of Sonora, Mexico, on
                                June 5 1882, as is shown by a copy of his receipt for said arms,
                                remitted herewith.</p>
                            <p>Said William J. Ross entered into the State of Sonora for the purpose
                                of having the arrest made of <hi rend="italic">hostile Apache
                                    Indians</hi>, who had fled there, after murdering certain
                                citizens of Arizona, and for whose arrest he had proper warrants,
                                issued by the authorities of Pima County, Arizona, within the limits
                                of which the offense had been committed. Said Ross had sent a
                                courier with a letter to General Terrazas, of Chihuahua, in which
                                State he had information the Indians for whose arrest he held the
                                warrants were supposed to be, desiring to have them delivered to
                                him, which courier was arrested by General Reyes, and letter taken,
                                by which the request of said Ross failed to reach said General
                                Terrazas. That afterwards he was arrested by said General Reyes, and
                                his arms, &amp;c., taken from him—a receipt therefor given, a copy
                                of which is hereby submitted—and ordered to at once return to
                                Arizona, and which order he at once obeyed, as will be shown by the
                                sworn statement of said Ross, herewith submitted as Exhibit F.</p>
                            <p>I would most respectfully ask that your Department request that the

                                the State of Chihuahua. Captain Ross had taken the precaution to
                                notify General Terrazas, commander of the Mexican troops in the
                                State of Chihuahua, of his presence in that State, and the object
                                for which he was there. His courier was captured by General Reyes,
                                and thereby the desire and object of Captain Ross was thwarted.</p>

                                that he has served as field officer of volunteers during the late

                                thereafter was lieutenant in the regular army of the United States;
                                that on the 29th day of April, A. D. 1882, he was duly appointed
                                deputy sheriff of Pima County, Arizona Territory, as more fully
                                appears by the certified copy of said appointment attached hereto

                                arrest was placed in his hands by his principal, the sheriff of Pima
                                County, for the arrest of certain Indians for the crime of murder,
                                as more fully appears by the certified copy of said warrant attached
                                hereto and made a part hereof, and marked Exhibit B. That it
                                appearing to said sheriff that said Indians would likely resist
                                arrest, he was instructed by said sheriff, in accordance with the
                                instructions, given to said sheriff by the board of supervisors of
                                said Pima County, to swear in as a posse comitatus about fifty men,
                                the number deemed sufficient to overcome said resistance. A
                                certified copy of said resolution is hereunto attached, and marked
                                Exhibit C. That in accordance with said instructions he swore in
                                fifty men as special deputy sheriffs; that thereafter and on the 9th
                                day of May, A. D. 1882, he was duly commissioned as captain of
                                militia of the Territory of Arizona, and a commission to that effect
                                duly issued to him, a certified copy of which is hereunto attached
                                and marked Exhibit D, and that said men, to the number of fifty,
                                were duly enrolled as a, company of the militia of the Territory of
                                Arizona. That said company were mounted and furnished with arms by
                                the said county of Pima, there being no money in the treasury of the
                                Territory for such purpose; that thereafter and in execution of said
                                warrant, and on or about the 10th day of May, A. D. 1882, he took up
                                the trail of the band of Indians with whom, as said deponent was
                                informed and believed, said Indians against whom said warrant was
                                issued, were: That he pursued said trail nearly due east until about
                                the 28th of said May, when he met a detachment of twelve men of the
                                Sixth United States Cavalry, who informed him that the Mexican
                                troops had said Indians surrounded at a place near Casas Grandes in
                                the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, and that their commander had
                                requested said troops to cut their line in the rear, as his, the
                                said commander’s, line was thin in places, and he did not know
                                whether or not he could hold them. For the purpose of assisting said
                                Mexican troops in holding and capturing said Indians, this deponent
                                pushed in the direction of said troops as rapidly as possible, and
                                on the second day of June met and joined a company of sixty men of
                                the National Guard of Mexico, under command of Captain Ramirez; and
                                from the second of said June until the fifth thereof he operated
                                with said Captain Ramirez, in guarding the rear line of the Mexican
                                troops to prevent said Indians from breaking back; that on the
                                fourth of said June he sent a courier to Colonel Terrazas, the
                                commanding officer of the Mexican forces in Chihuahua with a letter
                                offering his services and that of his men, in any capacity he might
                                see fit to employ him and them; that as he afterwards learned said
                                courier was taken prisoner by General Reyes, as were all the men
                                sent to Janos to purchase supplies; General Reyes opened said letter
                                and learned from its contents who said deponent was, and moved his
                                force consisting of one regiment of infantry and a squadron of
                                cavalry on said deponent and his men, and demanded of this deponent
                                that he and his men surrender up their arms and return to the United
                                States; that in accordance with said demand this deponent and his
                                men surrendered up their arms and returned to the United States,
                                marching through nearly three hundred miles of dangerous Indian
                                country without arms; that at request of this deponent, said General
                                Reyes gave this deponent a receipt for the arms so taken, and
                                embodying therein the order commanding him to return to the United
                                States. A certified copy of which together with a translation
                                thereof is hereunto annexed and made a part hereof marked Exhibit E.
                                And deponent further avers that the said taking of said arms was at
                                the Casa de Janos in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, and that said
                                State of Chihuahua was not under the command of said General Reyes,
                                but was under the command of said Colonel Terrazas and that the said
                                disarming of this deponent and his men was without the knowledge or
                                consent of said commanding officer in said State of Chihuahua,
                                namely, said Colonel Terrazas. And further deponent sayeth not.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your note of this date, accompanied by a copy of a communication with
                            its inclosures, which was addressed to you by His Excellency Governor F.
                            A. Tritle, of Arizona Territory, relative to the arrest and expulsion
                            from the Mexican territory of Capt. William J. Ross, a deputy sheriff of
                            Pima county, and a posse comitatus under his command, by order of Gen.
                            Bernardo Reyes, of Sonora, on the 5th day of June last.</p>
                        <p>You were pleased to furnish me with a statement of the circumstances of
                            this case, which shows, in substance, that Captain Ross was appointed a
                            deputy sheriff of Pima County, and charged with the execution of a
                            warrant for the arrest of certain hostile Indians; that he was soon
                            afterwards appointed captain of the militia of Arizona Territory, and
                            that, with a force of about fifty men, who had been armed as a posse
                            comitatus, he entered the territory of Mexico, whence he addressed a
                            communication to General Terrazas, asking his permission to arrest the
                            Indians; that this communication was received and opened by General
                            Reyes, who summoned him to lay down his arms and leave the territory of
                            Mexico, which Captain Ross and his men were obliged to do.</p>
                        <p>You are pleased to state in conclusion that Governor Tritle makes the
                            very reasonable request that the arms taken from Captain Ross and his
                            companions may be restored to the authorities of Arizona Territory, and
                            that you think that this may be obtained more speedily and with fewer
                            formalities through my mediation with the military authorities of Sonora
                            than through a formal representation made by the United States legation
                            in the city of Mexico; and that, desiring to terminate this matter in a
                            frank and friendly manner, you abstain from criticizing the course
                            pursued by General Reyes in disarming a party whose mission was one of
                            justice and good-will, and in exposing them to the dangers of a long
                            march through the wilderness.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have the honor to inform you that as soon as I received
                            information of the affair mentioned by you in your aforesaid note, both
                            through the reports concerning it which were published in the newspapers
                            of this country and through what you were pleased to communicate to me
                            in the interview which I had with you at the Department of State on the
                            6th instant, I anticipated your wishes by telegraphing the facts of the
                            case to the Government of Mexico, requesting it to issue orders to
                            General Reyes for the immediate restoration of the aforesaid arms to his
                            excellency the governor of Arizona Territory.</p>
                        <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>I have this day received a telegram from the secretary of foreign
                            relations of Mexico, a copy and translation of which I inclose, bearing
                            date of July 10, in which that officer informs me that, although the war
                            department has no official knowledge of the disarming of the American
                            posse by General Reyes, he has, nevertheless, ordered that, if such
                            posse was disarmed, the arms be restored to the United States forces
                            that may be nearest to the frontier.</p>
                        <p>This very just request of the United States Government that the aforesaid
                            arms be restored, which request you were pleased to convey to me in your
                            communication of this date, has thus been complied with.</p>
                        <p>Before concluding this note it seems proper for me to remark that, duly
                            appreciating the frank and friendly spirit expressed by you in your
                            aforesaid note, I think that I shall duly reciprocate it by informing
                            you that, according to the Constitution of the United States of Mexico,
                            it is not allowable for any foreign armed force to enter the national
                            territory without permission from the President of the Republic, granted
                            with the approval of the Senate. Captain Ross not having obtained such
                            permission, it is evident that he had illegally entered the territory of
                            Mexico, and that it was the duty of General Reyes to act as he did.</p>
                        <p>That officer probably had not sufficient force at his disposal (being
                            engaged in active operations against the hostile Indians) to furnish an
                            escort to Captain Ross and his men as far as the United States frontier,
                            in order to protect them from any attack by the Indians, as it is
                            probable he would have done had he had a sufficient force for that
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>The danger to which those citizens of the United States were thus exposed
                            is certainly very much to be regretted, but I do not think that General
                            Reyes, and still less the Mexican Government, can be held responsible
                            therefor.</p>
                        <p>Neither General Reyes, the commanding officer of the regular force on the
                            frontier, nor General Luis Terrazas, governor of the State of Chihuahua,
                            nor Colonel Joaquin Terrazas (brother of General Luis Terrazas),
                            commander of the local forces sent in pursuit of the Indians, has power
                            to grant permission to a foreign force to enter the territory of Mexico,
                            even if such permission is asked of them, for, as I have already
                            remarked, it can be granted by the President only, with the approval of
                            the Senate.</p>
                        <p>This cannot, moreover, be considered as an extradition case, because the
                            stipulations of the treaty in force between the two nations, which was
                            signed at the city of Mexico, December 11, 1861, were not therein
                            observed, since, according to that treaty, the arrest of offenders is to

                            hostile Indians.</p>

                            that your note of the 22d ultimo, with its accompaniments, was referred
                            to the General of the Army of the United States, who referred it to his
                            department with the following indorsement thereon: <quote

                            <p>On the 17th of April last, Ju (the chief of the band of Chiricahuas
                                which broke out in September, 1881) returned secretly from Mexico
                                with some 60 of his band to the San Carlos Reservation, and
                                compelled the remainder of the Chiricahuas under Loco, consisting of
                                about 40 men and 300 women and children, to leave the
                                reservation.</p>
                            <p>They left on the night of April 18, 1882, killing the Indian chief of
                                police, Sterling, and the police sergeant.</p>
                            <p>They proceeded towards Fort Thomas, killing 10 men, women, and
                                children on Eagle Creek, and the murder of other citizens in the
                                same valley was reported.</p>
                            <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Schofield, Sixth Cavalry, with two troops of his
                                regiment from Fort Thomas, pursued the band, and part of the command
                                under Lieutenant Sands overtook the fugitives and pursued them for 3
                                miles, but, getting out of ammunition, returned.</p>
                            <p>On the 20th April, Captain Gordon, Sixth Cavalry, with 119 men
                                (including an Indian scout company) left Fort Grant to intercept the
                                band should they go out by Eagle Creek or Clifton.</p>
                            <p>The commanding officer District of New Mexico (Colonel Mackenzie)
                                having been advised of the trouble, Lieutenant-Colonel Forsyth with
                                four troops of the Fourth Cavalry, at Separ, N. Mex., were on the
                                alert to co-operate.</p>
                            <p>General McDowell ordered Harris’ troop of the First Cavalry to report
                                to General Willcox, and immediate steps were taken to use all the
                                troops in the Department of Arizona available.</p>
                            <p>On the 25th April, the General of the Army, then in San Francisco,
                                telegraphed suggesting that a regiment of infantry from Texas might
                                be ordered to report to Colonel Mackenzie to patrol the line of the
                                Southern Pacific Railroad so as to leave the troops in Arizona and
                                New Mexico free to take the field.</p>
                            <p>The General also instructed General McDowell that Loco’s band should
                                be attacked wherever found, without regard to relative numbers.</p>
                            <p>Alarming reports were received of the loss of life, &amp;c., from the
                                depredation of the Chiricahuas, but many of the reports proved to be
                                considerably exaggerated.</p>
                            <p>On the 24th April, Lieutenant-Colonel Forsyth with his command found
                                the hostiles in an impregnable position in Stein’s Peak Range, New
                                Mexico, where he attacked and fought them, with a loss of five men
                                killed and five men wounded, killing two Indians and wounding a
                                number.</p>
                            <p>On the 26th April, General McDowell repeated a dispatch from General
                                Willcox stating that Captain Overton, Sixth Cavalry, reported the
                                Indians had killed many people along the Upper Gila, and that he was
                                pushing forward on trail of main body towards Doubtful Cañon, in
                                Stein’s Peak Range.</p>
                            <p>On the 26th, General Sheridan reported that Colonel Forsyth had a
                                force of about 500 men, Fourth Cavalry, and scouts, with him, and
                                that he and Captain Tupper with <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436"
                                    facs="0508"/>two troops Sixth Cavalry were close on trail of the
                                Indians. General Sheridan said he could send Third Cavalry at any
                                moment.</p>
                            <p>April 28th, General Willcox repeated by telegraph that the actual
                                outbreak could be handled with the force in the department, but that
                                as there were indications of fresh outbreaks reported, an additional
                                regiment of cavalry and one of infantry should be sent. He also on
                                the same day gave the strength of the troops in the Department of
                                Arizona as 613 cavalry and 487 infantry.</p>
                            <p>On the 28th April, Captain Tupper with troops G and M, Sixth Cavalry,
                                struck the Indians about 35 miles east of Cloverdale and had a
                                desperate fight with them, killing 12 or 15 Indians, including
                                Loco’s son, and capturing 70 head of stock. The fight lasted from
                                daybreak till noon. Captain Tupper lost one man killed and two
                                wounded.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Forsyth and Captain Tupper united, then continued the pursuit
                                of the Indians towards Mexico.</p>
                            <p>May 2d, General McDowell telegraphed that the governor of Arizona had
                                called upon General Willcox for protection for the settlements, and
                                that he therefore thought that General Willcox would need the
                                additional troops asked for.</p>
                            <p>The First Infantry and Third Cavalry were thereupon definitely
                                ordered to Arizona (General Orders of April 29 and May 1, from
                                Division of Missouri), and the Seventh Infantry in Department of
                                Dakota was ordered to be held in readiness.</p>
                            <p>May 3, 1882, General Sheridan telegraphed that 13 Indians were killed
                                in Captain Tupper’s fight; that the Indians had crossed into Mexico,
                                and that Colonel Garcia with a column of Mexican troops had attacked
                                the Indians, killing 78 and capturing 33. Colonel Forsyth returned
                                to Separ, N. Mex., from the pursuit of the Indians on the 4th of
                                May, having kept up the pursuit of Loco’s band until he received
                                reliable intelligence of the practical annihilation by the Mexican
                                troops under Garcia.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Forsyth reported the number of Indians killed from April 25
                                to 29 as 98 (including the 78 killed by the Mexicans).</p>
                            <p>June 3, General Sheridan telegraphed that a dispatch from General
                                Fuero (commanding the Mexican forces in Chihuahua) to General Pope,
                                informed him that Ju’s band of Apaches were defeated by the Mexican
                                forces at Bosque de Santiago May 25, with loss of 37 Indians killed
                                and 10 captured, and this, with the losses of Loco’s band in
                                previous fights, practically finishes up the renegades from San
                                Carlos.</p>
                            <p>June 5, General McDowell telegraphed that it was reported that
                                various small parties of Indians were in the Whitestone, Dragoon,
                                Huachuca, and Chiricahua Mountains, and that troops from Forts
                                Huachuca, Bowie, and Camp Price have been hunting them, while the
                                San Pedro Valley and crossing of the Gila towards the San Carlos
                                Reservation were guarded by troops from Forts Grant and Thomas.</p>
                            <p>No further disturbances at the San Carlos Reservation have been
                                reported.</p>
                            <p>Upon the arrival of the First Infantry and Third Cavalry, they were
                                distributed to the most exposed posts in Arizona.</p>
                            <p>On the 2d May (in response to a House resolution) the aggregate
                                number of troops available in the Department of Arizona, after the
                                arrival of the First Infantry and Third Cavalry, was stated to be
                                2,377 (approximate).</p>

                            addressed this Department, inquiring whether, in the event of an
                            agreement between his government and that of Mexico looking to-the
                            tender of the position of arbitrator between the two countries to the
                            President, the trust would be accepted; and that on the 24th of July Mr.
                            Frelinghuysen replied to Senor Montufar that “if an agreement be reached
                            between Guatemala and Mexico, tendering to the President the post of

                                appearance near Janos of a party of savages, and to the
                                recommendation made in connection therewith as to the desirability
                                of mutual co-operation on the part of the American and Mexican
                                forces on the frontier in pursuing the Apaches, for the obtainment

                                to inform you, by order of the President of the republic, that

                                heretofore transmitted to it, the military commanders in that zone
                                are under instructions, in operating against the Indians, when this
                                is necessary, to act in concert with the commanders of the American
                                forces; and that, as I informed you in a separate communication, I
                                this day transcribe to Generals G. Treviño Carlos Fuero, José G.
                                Carbo, and Bernardo Reyes, the note from your department of the 10th

                            informed by telegraph by your government of the signature on that day of
                            the treaty defining the boundary between Mexico and Guatemala, from the
                            Atlantic to the Pacific. You also do me the favor to furnish a copy of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In conversation on Monday last with Mr.
                        Rochaupen, upon my handing to him a copy of the printed circular of the
                        Treasury Department addressed to United States collectors of customs
                        informing them of the repeal of the law imposing discriminating duties on
                        merchandise produced east of the Cape of Good Hope, imported from a place
                        west thereof, he remarked that this government was now engaged upon the
                        subject of the discriminating duties, amounting to 30 per cent., which the
                        Venezuela Government had lately imposed upon all merchandise imported from
                        the Antilles; that such action was ruinous to the commerce of Curacoa. He
                        also stated that the English Government had protested against this act on
                        the part of Venezuela and had set up treaty obligations with that country
                        against the same, but so far without effect. He said he had just been
                        reading the communication of the President of the United States to Congress
                        upon the subject of their relations with Venezuela and had noticed that the
                        President had therein referred to the inability of Venezuela to fulfill her
                        obligations. He thought the course of that government in imposing the
                        discriminating duties referred to was not calculated to improve her position
                        in that respect.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The King returned to the Hague yesterday, and
                        to-day went in great state to the hall of the Second House, where, in the
                        presence of the diplomatic corps and high officials of the kingdom, he
                        opened the new session of the States General.</p>
                    <p>I inclose a copy of the King’s address in the Dutch language, with a French
                        translation furnished to me officially; also an English translation.</p>
                    <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0514"/>
                    <p>The loss of the monitor Adder and its crew, to which the address refers,
                        occurred in July last. It left Ymuiden to go to Helvoetsluis. Some days
                        afterwards the bodies of its pilot and several of the crew were found not
                        far from Scheveningen. The crew and officers numbered over sixty. The vessel
                        itself was after considerable search discovered keel up, at the bottom of
                        the sea, about a mile and a half off the coast northwest of Scheveningen. It
                        was last reported in that locality, and although the weather it encountered
                        was rough, it was not very severe, and would not alone, without some defect
                        in the build of the vessel or seamanship of its officers, seem to explain
                        its loss. The cause of it is being sought for, and the whole matter
                        investigated by the Dutch authorities.</p>
                    <p>The reference in the address to the condition of affairs in Atjih is probably
                        caused, in part at least, by the news just received that the Atcheans have
                        lately (August 7th instant) attacked the Dutch forces at or near Payon,
                        causing a loss to them of 44 killed and wounded out of a force engaged of
                        140. Among the wounded were 2 officers. Eleven, killed, fell into the hands
                        of the enemy. It appears that during the past year in Atjih the Dutch have
                        lost in guerilla warfare 140 killed and wounded.</p>
                    <p>The recent law, by which 30 per cent, of the expenses of the public schools
                        in the kingdom is to be paid out of the general treasury, has made an
                        unusual demand upon its funds, which may in part explain the necessity of an
                        increase of the state revenues.</p>
                    <p>The statement that propositions relative to the elective franchise would be
                        submitted to the States General is no doubt the result of the constant
                        efforts for an extension of that right made by the liberal party in
                        Holland.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs</hi>: It is agreeable to me to see the
                            representatives of the Netherlands people again reassembled.</p>
                        <p>My relations with foreign powers are of the most friendly nature.</p>
                        <p>The navy and army have acquitted themselves, in their important duties,
                            with a zeal worthy of praise.</p>
                        <p>The navy has suffered a deplorable loss in the foundering of the monitor
                            Adder with its crew.</p>
                        <p>I shall trust to see passed in the course of the present session all the
                            legal measures required in order that our new penal legislation may go
                            into effect.</p>
                        <p>Although the state of affairs in Atjih is not all that could be desired,
                            I have confidence that the administration of that province with the aid
                            of the navy and army will be able more and more to confirm authority and
                            cause security to reign.</p>
                        <p>In the other parts of the Netherland Indies the condition of affairs in
                            general is matter of satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The epidemics which have afflicted some portions of the population have
                            not yet entirely ceased. The ravages of cattle diseases have nearly come
                            to an end.</p>
                        <p>The state of the colonies in the West Indies may be considered
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0515"/>
                        <p>Although there is reason to congratulate ourselves upon the increase of
                            the state’s receipts of late years, an augmentation of the sources of
                            revenue cannot longer be deferred. At the same time, there ought to be a
                            general reformation of our taxes. A proposition tending to accomplish
                            this reform will be presented to you.</p>
                        <p>A better regulation of local taxation seems more and more necessary. For
                            this purpose, in connection with the revision of the fiscal system of
                            the state, your co-operation will be asked.</p>
                        <p>A project for the modification of the law concerning higher school
                            education is in course of preparation.</p>
                        <p>Propositions relative to the elective franchise will reach you soon.</p>
                        <p>It is my intention to cause an examination to be made as to what articles
                            of the fundamental law it is important should be revised.</p>
                        <p>Your deliberations upon important projects of laws presented to you in
                            former sessions are awaited with a natural interest.</p>
                        <p>May our united efforts, under the indispensable blessing of God,
                            contribute to the happiness of our dear country.</p>
                        <p>I declare the session of the States General to be opened.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The noble action of the government in Russia
                        in hastening as it has done to relieve the distressing situation of the
                        survivors of the American Arctic exploring steamer Jeannette, and to
                        facilitate their speedy restoration to their homes, is welcomed by the
                        American people as a striking tribute of the good-will and fraternity of
                        sentiment which have traditionally subsisted between the United States and
                        Russia. Nor is it to the Government of the United States a less notable
                        proof of the closeness of the ties which bind the two countries in generous
                        fellowship. We see in this act of rescue something more than an exhibition

                        on a friendly shore—we recognize it as manifesting in a higher sense the
                        warmth of the association of two great nations whose intercourse has been
                        from the outset marked by signal and enduring friendship, and by acts of

                        hospitality of Russia to our unfortunate explorers on her coast has been

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the correspondence between the
                        Department and this legation upon the subject of American Jews in Russia, I
                        have the honor to report the following curious case:</p>
                    <p>About three weeks ago I was called upon by a man of the name of James G.
                        Moses, who produced his United States passport, and stated that he was a
                        Jew; that he was employed in the Ceniselli circus in this city as stable
                        director, and that he had been ordered out of the city as a Jew. He added
                        that he was not “one of those Talmud Jews”; that he belonged to the American
                        Reformed Church, known in Russia as the Karaim Jews.</p>
                    <p>* * * I asked the consul-general, who is in relations with the municipal
                        authorities, to apply to General Kosloff, prefect of police, on Mr. Moses’s
                        behalf.</p>
                    <p>As soon as General Kosloff understood that Moses was a Karaim Jew, he told
                        the consul-general to send the man to him the next morning accompanied by
                        his employer.</p>
                    <p>The next moning they went accordingly, and the result of the interview was
                        that Mr. Moses was informed that General Kosloff would recommend that
                        permission be given him to remain, and in the mean time to give himself no
                        uneasiness. I understand that he has since received the necessary
                        permission.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the Karaim or Reformed Jews are of a superior class, and have
                        never given the Russian Government any trouble or been found enrolled among
                        the Nihilists.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Moses is a resident of New York, born in Germany, but taken to the United
                        States when a young child.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the long
                        expected measure for the relief of the peasants in Russia, and of which I
                        gave you an outline in my No. 113, of 5th May last, has at length been
                        decided upon and is to go into effect January 1, 1883.</p>
                    <p>The decree has been delayed by the necessity for further examination of the
                        question, how much the indebtedness of the peasants should be reduced, and
                        how the deficiency was to be met.</p>
                    <p>The principal features of this measure are foreshadowed in my No. 113, to
                        which I have the honor to refer you.</p>
                    <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0517"/>
                    <p>Two important points stand out in the decree, the rest being matter of
                        detail: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The indebtedness of about 15,000 serfs to their former
                                proprietors, for lands bought of them, is canceled. The state
                                assumes this indebtedness, and the peasants are hereafter to pay the
                                state.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>This indebtedness to the state is reduced by at least one-seventh,
                                and in exceptional cases considerably more.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: In my note of December 9–21 last, I
                            had the honor to inform your excellency that I had received telegraphic
                            instructions from my government to tender its hearty thanks to all
                            Russian authorities and persons who had been instrumental in assisting
                            the survivors of the Jeannette.</p>
                        <p>To-day I am in receipt of written instructions upon the same subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State assures me that the noble action of the Imperial
                            Government in hastening to relieve the distressing situation of the
                            survivors of the American steamer Jeannette, and to facilitate their
                            speedy restoration to their homes, is welcomed by the American people as
                            a striking tribute to the good-will and fraternity which have
                            traditionally existed between the United States and Russia. While to the
                            Government of the United States it is, in addition, a notable proof of
                            the closeness of the ties which bind the two countries in generous
                            fellowship. Both government and people see in this act of rescue
                            something more than an exhibition of that natural humanity which prompts
                            governments as well as individuals to succor the distress and relieve
                            the needs of those cast upon a friendly shore; they recognize it as
                            manifesting the warmth of the association of two great nations, whose
                            intercourse has been from the outset marked by signal and enduring
                            friendship and by acts of mutual consideration and esteem.</p>
                        <p>The President directs me to convey these sentiments to His Majesty’s
                            Government, and to assure it through your excellency, in the name of the
                            Government and people of the United States, of the deep gratification
                            with which the great hospitality of Russia to our unfortunate explorers,
                            cast upon her coast, has been received in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Happy to be the channel through which these earnest assurances are
                            conveyed to your excellency, I beg at the same time to assure you,

                            to address tome under the instructions of the Secretary of State of the

                            which the authorities of Eastern Siberia have been instructed to extend

                        <p>The circumstance that they belonged to a country for which sentiments of
                            friendship are traditional in Russia certainly could only increase the

                            their aid in their distress.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty the Emperor was much pleased to learn that the good will of
                            these authorities has been received by the American people as a proof of
                            the sympathy which the Russian nation feels for them.</p>
                        <p>My august master is glad to see on every occasion these ties, to which
                            His Imperial Majesty attaches a great importance, grow closer and
                            closer.</p>

                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">a brief account of the last riots at
                                warsaw.</hi></p>
                        <p>In the month of April last, just before the holiday of Corpus Christi, on
                            which, according to the Catholic customs, great religious processions
                            take place all over the whole country, there appeared in the streets and
                            workshops of our town, as well as in many of the principal manufacturing
                            towns in the whole country, printed proclamations, instigating the
                            Christian population against the Jews. Similar tendencies were never
                            heard of here until the anti-Semite riots in Russia, namely, Kieff,
                            Odessa, Charkoff, &amp;c., and it is certain they did not spring out on
                            this soil, but were conveyed here from the main source.</p>
                        <p>The sober and well thinking inhabitants, with the assistance of the local
                            governor-general, succeeded in influencing the Catholic clergy, who
                            again on their part, by proper sermons preached from the pulpits all
                            over the country, succeeded in refraining the greatest part of the
                            lowest class of people in taking part in the riots, and in reality the
                            last events were only perpetrated by minor apprentices, people of the
                            owest rank, without any employment and reprobates, as there were hardly
                            any amidst <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0519"/>the whole number of
                            the arrested that might be said belonged to the better class of
                            artisans; and it is a fact proved by the investigating judges that the
                            violent hands laid upon the property of others were only those of the
                            rabble amidst whom appeared leaders never seen here before, but that
                            such an event could possibly take place here was not supposed even by
                            the greatest pessimists.</p>
                        <p>During the divine service on Christmas day in the Holy Cross church,
                            situated in one of the principal streets of this town, about 12 o’clock
                            in the day, when the church was overcrowded with the pious, a cry of
                            “fire” was raised, as it was afterwards ascertained, by pickpockets, one
                            of whom was a Jew; it is said that the same cry was simultaneously
                            raised in four other churches. The people began to throng to the
                            entrance, and as the church doors are somewhat elevated, to which two
                            flights of broad stone stairs of thirteen steps each are leading, here
                            they began to crowd, fall, and trample each other, and here principally
                            the whole catastrophe took place, so that in the course of a quarter of
                            an hour there were thirty killed, and twenty-six seriously injured, who
                            were taken to a hospital close by, of whom two died soon after. The
                            governor-general appeared on the spot in order to exert his influence on
                            the excited populace, and just at that time voices were heard from
                            amidst the crowd, “It is the Jews that caused this disaster; let us have
                            our revenge on the Jews!”</p>
                        <p>Being a first rank holiday, only the Jewish shops were half opened, and
                            the rabble began to pilfer the Jewish brandy and tobacco shops, as well
                            as their private lodgings, principally those belonging to the poorer
                            class and those situated in the back streets, and before the police,
                            gendarmes, and troops could render any real service, the rest of that
                            day and the whole night passed; on the next day, however, the
                            authorities took more energetical steps, and on the third succeeded in
                            putting a final stop, and since that time no attempt whatever was made
                            to renew the riots. During these whole disturbances there has not
                            occurred a single case neither of murder, or violation of woman, as the
                            chief object of the rabble was pilfering, which was effected, according
                            to official statement, in 1,025 shops, and the total number of families
                            that suffered is stated to be 2,011, about 10,000 persons; and the
                            damages caused by these broils, according to the official statement of
                            the committee appointed for that purpose, was reduced to the amount of
                            767,339 rubles, as according to private Jewish accounts it reached to
                            1,200,000 rubles, which sum was doubtless greatly exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>The number of persons arrested was over 3,000. The exaggeration of these
                            street broils in the Times, as well as in many of the other foreign
                            papers, may be principally attributed to the Jewish propaganda, for the
                            purpose of exciting commiseration, and consequently augmenting the
                            subscriptions collected everywhere, and which to the present day amount
                            to 146,400 rubles.</p>
                        <p>Besides the poorer class of Jewish shopkeepers who sustained considerable
                            losses, as many of them lost all they had, it also affected in a great
                            measure many of the house proprietors, merchants, manufacturers,
                            brewers, with whom that class of people caried on business, as on that
                            account the Jews, with few exceptions, do not pay neither their rents,
                            nor for the goods they had taken.</p>
                        <p>It is the general conviction here, and there is not the least doubt in
                            the truth of it, that this evil propensity was totally unknown here,
                            but, as I already stated above, was brought over from the main source,
                            but which, notwithstanding the antipathy towards the Jews, fortunately
                            did not take deep root, thanks to the clergy, who since the very
                            appearance of the stimulating proclamations, not only in the churches,
                            but availed themselves of every opportunity to avert the evil, and who
                            now continue their work to obliterate the traces of the inhuman
                            deeds.</p>

                            Lynde &amp; Hough, of San Francisco, Cal., stating that they are
                            extensively engaged in the Pacific coast cod fisheries, and that they
                            will fit out their vessels, to sail about the 1st of May next, in that
                            enterprise, in which they have never been molested; but they now learn
                            that foreign vessels must receive an order from the governor of Siberia,
                            besides pay a duty of $10 per ton on all fish caught in Russian waters,
                            which, if sustained, will be ruinous.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You will please pardon us for this seeming
                            intrusion, but the matter we now seek your aid and kind assistance is of
                            great import to us.</p>
                        <p>We are now and have been extensively engaged in the Pacific coast cod
                            fisheries, and, in fact, are among the very few fifteen years ago who
                            started in a small way, believing with energy and fair dealing we could
                            work up an enterprise that would be a benefit to the coast. Our ideas
                            were correct. We have been yearly sending vessels to the coast of
                            Kamtschatka (sea of Okhotsk) for fish. We never have been molested in
                            Russian waters from catching codfish or procuring bait, which are small
                            salmon in the rivers, or filling fresh water for use of ship, but it
                            appears now there is a law which has never been enforced against
                            foreigners, the same we have recently noted, and which we have been
                            apprised of, and the substance is that foreign vessels must receive an
                            order from the governor of Siberia, besides must pay a duty of $10 per
                            ton on all fish caught in Russian waters. This decree, if sustained, is
                            ruinous to one of the best and rising industries of the coast, and as we
                            fit our vessels to sail about 1st of May, leaves us but little chance to
                            arrange matters this season save with your kind assistance in the
                            matter. Our business is fishing entirely. We use no trade with natives,
                            having nothing to do with the taking or purchasing of furs. At this time
                            we are placed in a very bad predicament. Trusting that you can relieve
                            us from this embarrassment, and receive an early reply on the
                            subject.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        a circular of the Treasury Department of July 30 last, upon the subject of
                        fishing, &amp;c., in the Behring Sea and in the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>
                    <p>I am able to give the Department some little information upon this subject,
                        derived nearly four years ago from Mr. Charles H. Smith, for many years a
                        resident of Vladivostok, and at one time our consul or vice-consul at that
                        port.</p>
                    <p>A glance at the map will show that the Kurile Islands are dotted across the
                        entrance to the Sea of Okhotsk the entire distance from Japan on the south
                        to the southernmost cape of Kamtschatka on the north.</p>
                    <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0522"/>
                    <p>In the time when Russia owned the whole of these islands, her representatives
                        in Siberia claimed that the Sea of Okhotsk was a <hi rend="italic">mare
                            clausum</hi>, for that Russian jurisdiction extended from island to
                        island and over two marine leagues of intermediate sea from Japan to
                        Kamtschatka.</p>
                    <p>But about five years ago Russia ceded the, southern group of these islands to
                        Japan, in return for the half of the island of Sahahis, which belonged to
                        that power.</p>
                    <p>As soon as this was done it became impossible for the Siberian authorities to
                        maintain their claim. My informant was not aware that this claim had ever
                        been seriously made at St. Petersburg.</p>
                    <p>The best whaling grounds are found in the bays and inlets of the Sea of
                        Okhotsk. Into these the Russian Government does not permit foreign whalers
                        to enter, upon the ground that the entrance to them, from headland to
                        headland, is less than two marine leagues wide. But while they permit no
                        foreign whalers to penetrate into these bays, they avail themselves of their
                        wealth very little. The whole privilege of whaling in those waters is a
                        monopoly owned by an unimportant company, which employs two or three sailing
                        schooners only, the trying and other laborious work being done at their
                        stations on shore.</p>
                    <p>Referring to my No. 44, of June, 1878, I have the honor to add that Baron
                        Stoeckl told me in conversation last winter that we failed to make a fishing
                        treaty with Russia in 1868 principally on account of the vested interests of
                        this company.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. H. Smith now resides at Great Falls, N. H., and would be glad, I am
                        sure, to put his information at the service of the Department.</p>

                        your No. 120, with its inclosures, in reference to our Pacific coast
                        fisheries. Your dispatch reached me yesterday, and to-day I have written to
                        Mr. de Giers upon the subject, and I propose to call upon him upon his first
                        reception day. In the meantime, and until further information, I do not see
                        that any new orders necessarily affecting our fishermen have been issued by
                        the Russian Government. Messrs. Lynde &amp; Hugh have apparently given
                        insufficient attention to the words “Russian waters.” These waters are
                        defined in the notice published by the imperial vice-consulate at Yokohama
                        as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>If I recollect correctly, the information given me by Mr. Smith upon this
                        subject, referred to in my No. 44, of June, 1878, and in my No. 207, of this
                        month, the cod banks lie in the open Sea of Okhotsk, many marine leagues off
                        the southwestern coast of Kamschatka. I observe that Messrs. Lynde &amp;
                        Hugh state that their vessels fish from ten to twenty-five miles from the
                        shore. At that distance in an open sea they cannot be said “to fish upon the
                        coast.”</p>
                    <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0523"/>
                    <p>I do not think that Russia claims that the Sea of Okotsk is a <hi
                            rend="italic">mare clausum</hi>, over which she has exclusive
                        jurisdiction. If she does, her claim is not a tenable one since the cession
                        of part of the group of the Kurile Islands to Japan, if it ever were tenable
                        at any time.</p>
                    <p>I may add that, according to the information given me four years ago, Russia
                        opposes no objections to foreign fishermen landing in desert places on the
                        coast of Kamtschatka, far from the few villages which are found on that
                        coast, for the purposes of catching bait and procuring fresh water; but she
                        does object to all communication between trading and fishing vessels and the
                        inhabitants, alleging that these vessels sell them whisky, upon which they
                        get drunk and neglect their fishing, their only means of livelihood, and
                        then, with their wives and children, die of starvation the ensuing
                        winter.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The prejudice of race and creed having in our
                        day given way to the claims of our common humanity, the people of the United
                        States have heard, with great regret, the stories of the sufferings of the
                        Jews in Russia. It may be that the accounts in the newspapers are
                        exaggerated, and the same may be true of some private reports. Making,
                        however, due allowance for misrepresentations, it can scarcely be doubted
                        that much has been done which a humane and just person must condemn.</p>
                    <p>The President, of course, feels that the Government of the Emperor should not
                        be held morally responsible for acts which it considers wrong, but which it
                        may be powerless to prevent.</p>
                    <p>If that be true of this case, it would be worse than useless for me to direct
                        you, as the representative of the United States, to give official expression
                        to the feeling which this treatment of the Jews calls forth in this country.
                        Should, however, the attitude of the Russian Government be different, and
                        should you be of the opinion that a more vigorous effort might be put forth
                        for the prevention of this great wrong, you will, if a favorable opportunity
                        offers, state, with all proper deference, that the feeling of friendship
                        which the United States entertains for Russia prompts this government to
                        express the hope that the Imperial Government will find means to cause the
                        persecution of these unfortunate fellow-beings to cease.</p>
                    <p>This instruction devolves a delicate duty upon you, and a wide discretion is
                        given you in its execution. However much this Republic may disapprove of
                        affairs in other nationalities, it does not conceive that it is its right or
                        province officiously and offensively to intermeddle. If, however, it should
                        come to your knowledge that any citizens of the United States are made
                        victims of the persecution, you will feel it your duty to omit no effort to
                        protect them, and to report such cases to this Department.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The anti-Jew riots have commenced again in the
                        south of Russia. They have been marked, as heretofore, by great and wanton
                        destruction of property, but by little personal violence.</p>
                    <p>The scene of the worst disturbances has been the town of Balta, a town of
                        about 25,000 inhabitants, nearly three-quarters of whom are Israelites. It
                        lies about 125 miles northwest of Odessa.</p>
                    <p>The riot is reported to have been from some trifling cause, such as the
                        refusal of a Russian peasant to pay for the liquor he had drunk in a
                        wine-shop kept by a Jew.</p>
                    <p>The police, which was very weak, appears to have interfered simply to prevent
                        the Jews from defending themselves.</p>
                    <p>At first the rioters did not number more than two hundred, many of them boys.
                        But soon the peasants began to come in from the country, joined the rioters,
                        and gave a more serious turn to the affair. The riot lasted two days before
                        troops arrived from Odessa to quell it. During this time, of the thousand
                        houses occupied by Jews, all, except perhaps fifty, were gutted and sacked.
                        As far as ascertained, one Israelite only lost his life. But the amount of
                        suffering undergone by over 15,000 people, men, women, and children,
                        destitute of food and lodging is painful to contemplate.</p>
                    <p>I am satisfied that the Russian Government is truly anxious to put a stop to
                        these riots. * * * It is reported that in the country far from garrison
                        towns the German inhabitants are very uneasy, and the saying is not
                        uncommon, “After the Jews, the Germans.”</p>
                    <p>But the position of the Russian Government in this matter is an exceedingly
                        difficult one. In a conversation with General Ignatieff a few days since, he
                        told me that the government had received the reports of the numerous local
                        boards appointed by it last year to suggest measures for the amelioration of
                        the condition of the Jews; that they had not only by a majority, but
                        unanimously, recommended their expulsion from the empire. “We have then,” he
                        said, “on the one hand 5,000,000 Jews, Russian subjects, clamoring to be
                        freed from all special restraints, and we have on the other 85,000,000
                        Russian subjects clamoring to have the 5,000,000 expelled from the empire.
                        What is to be done in such a case?”</p>

                    <p>I do not see that there is anything in the regulations referred to that

                        to interruption from the Russian authorities, who, finding them in
                        territorial waters, may accuse them of having taken their fish therein.</p>

                            communications which has taken place between us on the subject of a
                            notice published by our consul at Yokohama relative to fishing, to
                            hunting, and to trade in the Russian waters of the Pacific, and in reply
                            to the note which you addressed to me, dated March 15–27, I am now in a
                            position to give yon the following information:</p>
                        <p>A notice of the tenor of that annexed to your note of the 15th March was,
                            in fact, published by our consul at Yokohama, and our consul-general at
                            San Francisco is also authorized to publish it.</p>
                        <p>This measure refers only to prohibited industries and to the trade in
                            contraband; the restrictions which it establishes extend strictly to the
                            territorial waters of Russia only. It was required by the numerous
                            abuses proved in late years, and which fell with all their weight on the
                            population of our seashore and of our islands, whose only means of
                            support is by fishing and hunting. These abuses inflicted also a marked
                            injury on the interests of the company to which the imperial government
                            had conceded the monopoly of fishing, hunting (“exportation”) in islands
                            called the “Commodore” and the “Seals.”</p>
                        <p>Beyond this new regulation, of which the essential point is the
                            obligation imposed upon captains of vessels who desire to fish and to
                            hunt in the Russian waters of the Pacific to provide themselves at
                            Vladivostok with the permission or license of the governor-general of
                            Oriental Siberia, the right of fishing, hunting, and of trade by
                            foreigners in our territorial waters is regulated by article 560 and
                            those following, of vol. 12, part 2, of the Code of Laws.</p>

                        <p>The regulations of the committee of ministers approved by His Majesty the
                            Emperor the 3d May last set forth:</p>
                        <p>That it must be brought to the public knowledge that the government has
                            resolved to pursue with inflexibility all violence exercised against the
                            person and the property <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0527"/>of the
                            Israelites, who are under the protection of the laws, common in this
                            respect to all the population, by the same right as to those of the
                            other subjects of His Majesty the Emperor. That the competent provincial
                            authorities must be informed that the charge belongs to their
                            responsibility of the measures now to be taken with a view to avoid
                            occasions of similar disorders and to put a stop to them as soon as they
                            may break out; and for all negligence in this respect on the part of the
                            administrative authorities and of the police, when they might have, but
                            have not, taken the trouble to prevent acts of violence, those who have
                            been guilty will be relieved of their functions.</p>
                        <p>The publication of this expression of the imperial will has unfortunately
                            been provoked on several occasions by disorders which have been renewed
                            in different localities of the empire, accompanied by violence against
                            the Israelite population.</p>
                        <p>Such disorders, which, as a result, cause individuals to lose, without
                            distinction of race and religion, the certainty of the security of their
                            persons and of their property, prove the insufficiency of the guaranty
                            of the regular and peaceable course of public life, and deprive the
                            government of the possibility of devoting itself solely to a capital
                            question, and just now of special importance, viz, to harmonize the
                            activity of all governmental and social institutions and direct it
                            towards the determined and clearly defined object of the
                            re-establishment of tranquillity and order, which are the only sure
                            guarantees of the ulterior development of public security and
                            tranquillity. With this aim, the regulations of the committee of
                            ministers not only invite the competent authorities to take peremptory
                            measures to prevent the manifestation of all acts of violence, but
                            points out in addition the necessity of relieving from their functions
                            persons who may be guilty of any negligence in this respect.</p>
                        <p>In calling the most serious attention of the governors of the provinces
                            to the punctual and inflexible execution of the imperial will expressed
                            by the committee of ministers, I think proper on my side to explain, in
                            development of the fundamental idea, that violence and arbitrariness
                            cannot be justified by any inciting causes; that for this reason the
                            adoption of effective measures to be taken to prevent and arrest
                            disorders rests upon the personal responsibility of the governors; and
                            that every manifestation of local disorder will, as its inevitable
                            consequence, render also legally responsible all the functionaries whose
                            duty was the immediate charge of preventing disorders.</p>
                        <p>Not judging it possible to give here anymore direct instructions relative
                            to the means of attaining the above-mentioned end, considering that, on
                            one side, these means are indicated by the law itself, and that on the
                            other the choice to make among them when it is a question of applying
                            them. depends upon accidental circumstances, temporary and local, I have
                            the conviction that the governors of the provinces will carry out all
                            the requirements clearly established by the imperial will, and will
                            fully justify my hopes on this subject by pursuing on their side,
                            without the least hesitation, all negligence of the

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">To the honorable Secretary of
                                State:</hi></p>
                        <p>The undersigned ship-owners and merchants of New York respectfully ask
                            your attention to the charge of 10 cents per ton made by Spanish consuls
                            upon the cargo of every vessel clearing from an American port to any
                            port of the islands of Cuba or Porto Rico.</p>
                        <p>While we are aware that the Government of Spain has the right to impose
                            any duty upon, or even to prohibit, importations into the Spanish
                            colonies, we respectfully submit that the manner of collecting so large
                            a duty as 10 cents upon each ton of a ship’s cargo by requiring the ship
                            itself to pay it in advance, and in an American port, is highly
                            objectionable in form, and is unnecessarily burdensome upon the
                            ship-owners.</p>
                        <p>The ship is refused clearance at the consulate until the impost is paid,
                            and in the case of a miscellaneous cargo it is impossible for the owners
                            of the vessel to collect the same from the shippers. It amounts in the
                            present form to a clearance charge upon the ship itself, while if it
                            were collected at the Spanish port upon arrival, it would seem, as it
                            really is intended, we presume, to be, an import duty upon the cargo,
                            and would be paid by the consignees.</p>
                        <p>We feel assured that if the matter were brought to the notice of the
                            Spanish Government through your department it would receive attention,
                            and perhaps thereby American ship-owners, already sufficiently burdened,
                            would be relieved of a difficulty which, as at present imposed, bears
                            very heavily upon the carrying trade to the Spanish colonies.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons we beg the friendly remonstrances of your department
                            with the Spanish Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The attention of the Department of
                            State has been called (through Messrs. Miller &amp; Houghton, merchants
                            at New York) to a notice issued by the consul-general of Spain in that
                            city, and dated 14th October, 1881. The notice reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“By orders received from Madrid, on and after October 31 vessels going to
                            Cuba and Porto Rico will pay in this office the same clearance fees as
                            vessels bound for Spain.”</p>
                        <p>On learning of this “notice,” Messrs. Miller &amp; Houghton addressed a
                            letter, on the 27th October, to the consul-general, requesting to be
                            informed as to the exact meaning of said “notice.” The consul-general
                            replied on the next day (the 28th October) as follows:</p>
                        <p>“In answer to your inquiry by letter of the 27th instant, I beg to say
                            that, in conformity with orders received from Madrid, vessels bound for
                            Spain, Cuba, and Porto Rico will pay in this office, from the 31st
                            instant, the following clearance fees: For the manifest, $6; for bill of
                            health, $4; for crew list, $4; and for cargo, 10 cents for every 1,000
                            kilograms.”</p>
                        <p>The Department of State having also received communications from
                            merchants of other ports in the United States, complaining of the
                            Spanish consular fees on vessels clearing for ports in Spain, Cuba, and
                            Porto Rico, and particularly of the additional charge of 10 cents on
                            every 1,000 kilograms of the vessel’s cargo, I am instructed to invite
                            your excellency’s attention to the subject, with a view to having the
                            charge last above mentioned abolished.</p>
                        <p>In inviting your excellency’s attention to this subject, your excellency
                            will permit me to refer to the correspondence which took place on this
                            very subject between this legation and the department under your
                            excellency’s worthy charge in the year 1876. According to the then new
                            Spanish consular tariff, vessels of the United States clearing for
                            Spanish ports were obliged to pay Spanish consuls, besides the regular
                            fee for their clearance papers, the sum of 10 cents on every package,
                            whether large or small, of their cargo. This latter charge was looked
                            upon by my government as an export duty levied by Spain in our ports on
                            merchandise sent to the ports of Spain. Protest against such a charge
                            was therefore made, and the government of His Catholic Madjesty,
                            acknowledging the justness of the protest, issued a royal order, dated
                            the 18th of October, 1876, abolishing the charge on packages.</p>
                        <p>It would seem from the present complaints that the royal order above
                            referred to has been revoked, or, if not revoked, the charge which it
                            abolished has been restored by the substitution of a charge on the
                            weight of a vessel’s cargo. In complaining against this charge to the
                            Department of State, the merchants give, as an illustration of their
                            position, the following statement of what a vessel carrying 700 tons is
                            obliged to pay to Spanish consuls before obtaining her clearance papers:
                            First, the regular clearance fees, $23; second, on first 50 tons of
                            cargo, $8; third, on remaining 650 tons, at 10 cents per ton, $65; in
                            all, $96.</p>
                        <p>If the merchants or the shippers do not pay these charges, the consuls
                            refuse to grant the necessary clearance papers, and if the vessel sails
                            without them, she is heavily fined on her arrival in a Spanish port.
                            Consequently the merchants and shippers have no alternative but to pay
                            the excessive charges demanded by the consuls. Again, if the vessel is
                            bound for a Cuban port, she is obliged to pay, on her arrival, an
                            additional tonnage duty of $1.35 per ton. Then again, if the vessel’s
                            manifest does not show the exact weight of her cargo, she is liable, on
                            her arrival, to a fine of from $100 to $300, and in some cases to even a
                            larger sum, and, as it is impossible to calculate the amount of the
                            consul’s fees until the vessel is completely loaded, and in view also of
                            the fines to which a captain of a vessel is liable on arrival at a
                            Spanish port (however innocent he may be of any intention to infringe on
                            the customs regulations of the port of arrival), the merchants complain
                            that it is difficult to find vessels willing to proceed to Spanish ports
                            so long as they can find cargoes for ports of other nations. This fact,
                            I need hardly tell your excellency, is very injurious to the commercial
                            interests, not only of the United States, but to those of Spain as well.
                            I feel sure that Spain does not intend and does not desire to put
                            obstacles in the way of the commercial relations between the two
                            countries. On the contrary, I am confident that she is desirous, as is
                            my own government, to do all that can be done to increase so much as may
                            be possible those relations.</p>
                        <p>But, putting aside all consideration of the commercial relations between
                            the two countries, the present charge imposed by the Spanish
                            consul-general at New York and by the Spanish consuls in other ports of
                            the United States of 10 cents on every 1,000 kilograms on the cargo of
                            vessels clearing for Spanish ports is considered by my <pb n="458"
                                xml:id="pg_458" facs="0530"/>government in the same light as was the
                            package charge above referred to. Indeed, the Government of the United
                            States can look upon such a charge in no other way than as being an
                            export duty levied in its ports by Spain, and as such strongly protests
                            against it.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this protest for the consideration of your excellency, I
                            may be permitted to make the observation that I am confident that the
                            Government of His Catholic Majesty does not propose to arrogate to
                            itself the right to levy an export duty in the ports of foreign and
                            friendly nations. Such a duty, I need hardly tell your excellency, can
                            only be levied by the government of the port from whence the merchandise
                            may be shipped. This being the case, I am likewise confident that the
                            Government of His Catholic Majesty would be the first among the great
                            commercial nations of the world to protest against such a duty being
                            levied in its own po<gap quantity="2" unit="words"/> by foreign consuls
                            on merchandise shipped to foreign ports. This duty, in the opinion of my
                            government, is so clearly an export duty levied by Spain in the ports of
                            the United States as to need no argument, and as such my government
                            deems it inadmissible, and expects that it will be discontinued, as was
                            the “package” duty levied by Spain in 1876. That this expectation will
                            be realized my government entertains no doubt, upon a consideration of
                            the question by that of His Catholic Majesty.</p>
                        <p>I therefore present the question to your excellency, and in so doing beg
                            that your excellency will give the subject that early and attentive
                            consideration which its importance so justly merits.</p>

                            Spanish consul, amounting to $77.40, $14 of which were for customary
                            fees for such clearances, and $63.40 a charge of 10 cents per ton on

                            department to a charge imposed by the Spanish Government upon every
                            vessel clearing from an American port to a port in Cuba or Porto Rico,
                            amounting to 10 cents per ton on the cargo laden on board such
                            vessel.</p>
                        <p>A clearance of the vessel at the Spanish consulate cannot be obtained
                            until said tax has been paid, and it is therefore in the present form a
                            heavy tax on the already overburdened ship-owner.</p>
                        <p>From the manner in which the tax in question is levied, there seems no
                            doubt that it is intended as a duty on the goods, and should therefore
                            be collected from the shipper or receiver of the cargo, and not from the
                            ship-owner.</p>
                        <p>Assured that if the matter is presented to the Spanish Government through
                            your department it will receive attention, we sincerely hope that the
                            negotiations will result in the ship-owner being relieved of a
                            difficulty which now bears heavily on the trade to the Spanish colonies
                            named.</p>
                        <p>For reasons here given we beg the friendly remonstrance of your

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In Mr. Blaine’s instruction to you of the 23d
                        of November last, concerning the long pending and still unsettled claim of
                        the owners of the bark Masonic, some general observations were submitted in
                        regard to the arbitrary and unjust surveillance exercised toward American
                        merchant vessels in Spanish colonial ports. These suggestions of my
                        predecessor were made in the mutual interest of American and Spanish
                        commerce, and in promotion of the friendly relations which have so long
                        subsisted between the two nations. Since that instruction was forwarded
                        three other cases of less pecuniary magnitude, but of scarcely less
                        hardship, have been brought to the attention of the Department. In regard to
                        each of these, instructions have also been forwarded to your legation, but
                        as pertinent to the subject of this instruction it seems proper to advert
                        briefly to the facts upon which they rest.</p>
                    <p>The American brig George W. Chase was fined fifty dollars in November last by
                        the customs authorities at Sagua the sole ground for the fine being an
                        omission of certain words in a manifest. The clause of the document being
                        “900 bundles of hoops forty feet long [40 hoops in each bundle],” the words
                        inclosed in brackets were inadvertently omitted by the Spanish consul at
                        Philadelphia, who transcribed the document; and although the officer in
                        question certified as to the mistake, the imposition of the fine was
                        nevertheless adhered to. The second case [brought to attention by No. 1090
                        of Vice-Consul-General Williams] is that of the steamer Ellie Knight, which
                        entered the port of Havana with a Cargo of cattle from Mobile and Key West,
                        on the 27th December last, having on board 60,000 feet of lumber destined
                        for Key West, but which was kept on board as ballast while crossing the
                        Gulf. As a cattle-carrying boat the steamer was chargeable, under the
                        Spanish laws and revenue regulations governing the ports of Cuba, to a
                        tonnage duty of five cents per ton, which would have made the charge $14.90,
                        but, instead of this, the customs officers, on account of the 60,000 feet of
                        lumber, assessed a duty of $1.30 per ton, making the amount on, the vessel’s
                        tonnage $387.40, an excess of $372.50.</p>
                    <p>Still another and more recent case was that of the steamer Santiago, of New
                        York, a vessel regularly engaged in the trade between New York and the ports
                        of Santiago de Cuba and Cienfuegos, on the south side of the island of Cuba.
                        Under circumstances of great apparent hardship, a fine of nineteen hundred
                        dollars was imposed on the vessel, and the master, Captain Phillips, was
                        obliged to execute a bond, with sureties for the amount, in order to secure
                        a clearance for his vessel.</p>
                    <p>In each of these cases instructions have been forwarded to you, and they are
                        adverted to here only as being pertinent to the general subject of this
                        instruction.</p>
                    <p>They are examples of many similar occurrences to American vessels in the
                        colonial ports of Spain. Hitherto the consul-general of the United States at
                        Havana has been able to secure an adjustment of such cases by prosecuting
                        the complaints to the superior authorities at that port, and efforts looking
                        toward the same end were made by that officer in each of the cases referred
                        to. He was met, however, with the announcement that under an existing
                        ordinance, the strict observance of which has been re-enjoined by a royal
                        order recently promulgated in <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0533"/>Cuba,
                        the local authorities can no longer deal with such questions, but that they
                        must be remitted for settlement to the government at Madrid. The adoption of
                        this course of procedure by Spain has very much aggravated this general
                        grievance to American commerce. Complaints of such instances have of late
                        become so frequent from owners and masters of American vessels that the
                        question demands the most serious attention of this government. The
                        President therefore directs me to instruct you to bring the question to the
                        attention of his Catholic Majesty’s government and in doing so you will
                        request that authority shall be given, either to the captain-general in Cuba
                        or to his majesty’s minister at this capital, to consider such cases and
                        grant redress when necessary. The arbitrary conduct of subordinate officials
                        in Cuba cannot be submitted to without retaliation on Spanish vessels and
                        commerce, unless there is secured a more speedy remedy than is afforded by
                        resort to Madrid.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have lately, under instructions
                            from the Secretary of State of the United States, had occasion to
                            address your excellency in regard to certain fees imposed in Cuban ports
                            on the American vessels George W. Chase, Ellie Knight, and the Santiago.
                            Heretofore the consul-general of the United States at Havana has
                            generally been able to secure an adjustment of such cases on
                            presentation of the facts to the superior authorities at that port, and
                            he endeavored to do so in each one of the cases above mentioned, but was
                            informed that under an existing ordinance, the strict observance of
                            which has been re-enjoined by a royal order recently promulgated in
                            Cuba, the local authorities can no longer deal with such questions, but
                            that they must be remitted to the government at Madrid for
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The adoption of this course of procedure by His Catholic Majesty’s
                            government has very much aggravated the general grievance to American
                            commerce with the island of Cuba. Indeed, the complaints of owners and
                            masters of American vessels against this new grievance have been so
                            numerous that my government has been obliged to give the subject its
                            most serious attention, and, after due consideration, it has been
                            compelled to recognize the justice of those complaints.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary for me to point out to your excellency the
                            inconvenience to which the owners or captains are subjected in the event
                            of their vessels being fined <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0534"
                            />(as in the cases of the George W. Chase, Ellie Knight, and Santiago,
                            above referred to) in consequence of the royal order above mentioned.
                            They are not only obliged to deposit the amount of the fine, but are
                            also compelled to await the decision of the authorities here as to
                            whether or not it (the fine) has been justly imposed, and as the
                            distance between Cuba and Madrid is so great, the time occupied in
                            transmitting the facts of the case here and arriving at a decision must
                            necessarily be long. Meanwhile the owners of the vessels or the captains
                            are kept out of their money, and, as the sums so withheld are often
                            quite large, it is only natural that they should make complaints to the
                            government at Washington.</p>
                        <p>In view of these complaints, and of the frequency with which American
                            vessels have of late been victims to the arbitrary conduct of
                            subordinate customs officials in Cuba, the President, after having given
                            the subject his most serious consideration, has directed the Secretary
                            of State to instruct this legation to invite, through your excellency,
                            the attention of the government of His Catholic Majesty to the matter,
                            and in so doing to request that, as a proper means of doing away with
                            such complaints in the future, as well as to counteract any arbitrary
                            proceedings of the customs officials, authority may be given either to
                            the captain-general of the island of Cuba or to His Catholic Majesty’s
                            envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at Washington to
                            consider cases of fines imposed on American vessels in Cuban or in other
                            Spanish colonial ports, and to grant redress when the facts of the case
                            shall so warrant.</p>
                        <p>I have, therefore, the honor to bring the subject to your excellency’s
                            attention, not doubting that, in view of the importance attached to it
                            by my government, the wishes of the President, as above expressed, will
                            be most willingly and speedily complied with on the part of His Catholic
                            Majesty’s government.</p>
                        <p>I gladly avail myself, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Mr. Hamlin’s No. 10, and to your
                        instructions Nos. 24, 28, and 30, relating to the exaction, by Spanish
                        consuls in the United States, of ten cents per ton on the cargo of vessels
                        clearing for Spanish ports, I now have the honor to inclose for your
                        information, a copy of a futher note upon the subject, addressed by me to
                        the minister of state, dated the 17th ultimo.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, I deem it proper to state that a few days after sending
                        the above note I had occasion to see Mr. Mendez de Vigo (the minister of
                        state being absent) in regard to another matter, and in the course of
                        conversation the question of this charge came up. As no reply had been
                        received to either Mr. Hamlin’s or to my note, I thought the occasion a
                        proper one to express to him verbally the importance attached to the subject
                        by the Government of the United States and to request an early reply. This I
                        did, and Mr. Mendez de Vigo replied that he had already had two or three
                        conversations with the minister of hacienda in regard to the matter, but as
                        it was a grave question they had not been able to come to any decision,
                        adding that it was still under consideration, and that the result when
                        reached would at once be communicated to me.</p>
                    <p>This conversation took place about a month ago, I have not communicated it to
                        you or transmitted a copy of my note, for the reason that I have been
                        expecting from day to day to receive the reply of the minister of state, but
                        as the reply does not seem to come, I have thought best to now report the
                        conversation, and to transmit a copy of my note above referred to.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Feeling the deep interest you take in the
                            welfare and protection of every citizen of Florida, we take the liberty
                            of inclosing a memorial to the Hon. F. T. Frelinghuysen, Secretary of
                            State and very earnestly request that you will present the same in
                            person, and use your kind offices in furthering the purposes of said
                            memorial.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish smacks owned by Antonio Quintana Lopez, whose name appears in
                            the memorial, take nothing but foreign fish caught on the coast of
                            Mexico, but these Spanish smacks, in leaving Havana, do not clear for
                            Mexico, but simply clear coastwise for Cape San Antonio, so as to make
                            it appear that their cargoes are caught on the coast of Cuba, when in
                            reality they do not catch a solitary fish on the Cuba coast. They do
                            this for the purpose of avoiding tonnage dues, as Spanish vessels
                            coasting pay very light dues, and this order, now about to be enforced,
                            imposing nearly one and three-quarter cents per pound duty on live fish,
                            in addition to the enormous port <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0537"
                            />charges already charged American smacks or fishing vessels, is due
                            solely in the interest of Antonio Quintana Lopez and his associates, who
                            wish to monopolize the fish business at the ports of Cuba, and promises
                            to ruin a business for us at this port that has existed for forty-five
                            years, employing from sixteen to twenty-five vessels, ranging from
                            thirty-two to forty-eight tons each, and about one hundred and fifty men
                            on an average.</p>
                        <p>For what purpose is this tax to be imposed? Surely not for the benefit of
                            the Spanish Government, as it will compel the American smacks to keep
                            away from Havana, thereby not only losing the proposed duty, but also
                            losing large sums in port charges that are now being paid daily, we
                            might say, to the Spanish Government by our smacks, and it would also
                            increase the price of fish to an enormous figure in the Havana markets,
                            as most of the fish consumed there are caught on our coast by our
                            vessels; and if we are driven off by high duties and tonnage dues it
                            will leave their markets in the hands of monopolists, thereby placing
                            the price of fish so high as to be beyond the reach of the poorer
                            classes of their people, and it is their principal article of food. And
                            we think if you will kindly act with the honorable Secretary of State,
                            in calling this matter to the attention of the Spanish minister at
                            Washington, he will have it corrected by his home government. And, on
                            the other hand, if the Spanish Government can insist on their proposed
                            course, it will ruin the fishing business at this port, which, we assure
                            you, is no small item, and would cripple the industry of this port very
                            much.</p>
                        <p>The crews of our fishing vessels are composed principally of former
                            Spanish subjects (natives of the Canary Islands), and many of them still
                            claim allegiance to the crown of Spain. These men exist solely by
                            fishing on our coast in our own vessels, and not infrequently visit
                            their friends in the Canary Islands, and carry with them the money
                            earned while engaged on our coast, which contributes not a little to the
                            support of their families. You will doubtless observe that our memorial
                            is not only signed by persons engaged in the fishing business, but by
                            every business man on our island, showing it to be a matter of interest
                            to all.</p>
                        <p>Thanking you in advance for the support we are sure to receive from you,
                            we are,</p>

                            live fish for the Havana market, would respectfully represent:</p>
                        <p>That the business in which they are engaged is one which has been carried
                            on for over forty-five years, during which time live fish have been
                            admitted into the port of Havana free of duty.</p>
                        <p>That there are also a number of Spanish fishing-smacks engaged in
                            catching live fish for the same market, which catch their fish on the
                            Mexican coast, and in other than Cuban waters.</p>
                        <p>That several of these Spanish smacks are owned by Don Antonio Q. Lopez,
                            whose name appears hereinafter.</p>
                        <p>That the Governor-General of Cuba has, by an order published in Le Voz de
                            Cuba, of the issue of February 18, 1882, published at Havana, Cuba, a
                            translation of which order is hereto annexed, directed, “That from and
                            after the first day of April proximo live fish imported into the Island
                            of Cuba in foreign bottoms shall pay a duty of 75/1000 of an escudo on
                            each kilogram.”</p>
                        <p>That this rate is equal to $1.72½ on each quintal of one hundred
                            pounds.</p>
                        <p>That this demand is not a duty upon the importation of a foreign product,
                            but is a discrimination against American vessels carrying into Cuba an
                            article which is not the product of any country, and is in the direct
                            interest of Spanish vessel owners engaged in the business of catching
                            live fish.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore your memorialists beseech your attention to the premises, and
                            your offices to afford us such relief as may be obtained by the
                            abrogation, rescinding, or amending said order, or as may be in your
                            power to afford.</p>
                        <p>Your memorialists would also represent that while Spanish vessels
                            entering United States ports are only required to pay a tonnage fee of
                            thirty cents per ton, and that only once for the term of one year,
                            American smacks and vessels entering Havana are compelled to pay tonnage
                            dues of about $1.30 per ton, and this every time they enter the port,
                            which will average for the said smacks twelve trips a year; and thus
                            American vessels entering Havana are compelled to pay tonnage dues over
                            four times as large as Spanish vessels pay upon entering American ports,
                            and the aforesaid smacks during one year pay forty-eight times as much
                            as similar Spanish vessels would pay entering American ports the same
                            number of times.</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0538"/>
                        <p>That, in addition to the above tonnage dues, our vessels are compelled to
                            pay other port charges in Havana, amounting to from $32 to $40 in gold,
                            each and every trip made, as will appear from copies of itemized
                            expenses hereto attached.</p>
                        <p>All of which appears to your memorialists as contrary to the commercial
                            agreements between the United States and Spain, and deserving relief,
                            which your honor is prayed to obtain in their behalf.</p>

                        <p>His excellency the Governor-General, in compliance with the notice
                            contained in the royal order of the 22d of November, 1880, occasioned by
                            representations incited by Don Antonio Quintana Lopez, respecting the
                            importation of live fish in foreign bottoms, and in accordance with the
                            judgment of the Royal Commission on the tariff, at a meeting held on the
                            30th day of November last, has been pleased to order:</p>
                        <p>That from and after the first day of April proximo live fish imported
                            into the Island of Cuba in foreign bottom shall pay a duty of 75\1000 of
                            an escudo on each kilogram.</p>
                        <p>(This order is published in Le Voz de Cuba, of the 18th of February,

                            that I have been compelled to pay to the vice-consul of Spain at
                            Machias, Me., a Mr. I. Sargent, a fee or, better said, an “impost” of
                            ten cents for every kilo (about 2 pounds) on the weight of a cargo white
                            pine lumber bought and shipped for my account, on board the American
                            (United States) schooner Helen I. Holway, ———— Thompson, master, at
                            Machias, Me., and bound for Arroyo, Puerto Rico, a Spanish colony, an
                            act which I consider not only unjust, but also against international
                            laws, for reason that a consul holding an exequatur from his government
                            cannot levy and collect a tax on goods of American production and
                            growth, and shipped in American bottoms from this country, before they
                            have been landed in a Spanish port, on the road to which they may
                            perish.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the consul is exempt from taxation, although his office is
                            made one of “gain and profit” to his government.</p>
                        <p>If authorized by his government, it becomes more irksome, this impost, in
                            the face of the great consideration granted by the authorities of these
                            United States in allowing goods being shipped and laden on board of
                            vessels under the Spanish flag without imposing the differential duty,
                            enjoyed in the home country, formerly collected here, and which law, I
                            have been given to understand, has not been repealed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The attention of the Department of
                            State, at Washington, has lately been invited to an order issued by the
                            governor-general of the Island of Cuba, on the 18th February last,
                            imposing on and after the 1st April, 1882, a duty on live fish imported
                            into that island in foreign bottoms.</p>
                        <p>The order, as published in the La Voz de Cuba, of the 18th February last,
                            reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>“His excellency the governor-general, incompliance with the notice
                            contained in the royal, order of the 22d of November, 1880, occasioned
                            by representations incited by Don Antonio Quintana Lopez, respecting the
                            importation of live fish in foreign bottoms, and in accordance with the
                            judgment of the royal commission on the tariff, at a meeting held on the
                            30th day of November last, has been pleased to order:</p>
                        <p>“That from and after the 1st day of April promixo, live fish imported
                            into the Island of Cuba, in foreign bottoms, shall pay a duty of 75/1000
                            of an escudo on each kilogram.”</p>
                        <p>According to a memorial addressed to the Department of State by merchants
                            at Key West, Fla., engaged in catching fish (as well as merchants of
                            that place engaged in other business), and carrying them to the Cuban
                            markets, no duties have heretofore been levied upon the same in Cuban
                            ports, whether brought in Spanish or foreign bottoms.</p>
                        <p>While it is not the intention or wish of my government to interfere in
                            the least possible manner with the internal affairs of Spain, or of
                            those of her colonies, the facts represented in the above-mentioned
                            memorial, against the propriety or advisability of now imposing a duty
                            on that important article of food in the Island of Cuba, when brought in
                            foreign bottoms, seem to be so clear and so contrary to the real
                            interests of that island, that I am instructed to present to His
                            Catholic Majesty’s Government the following facts for its consideration:
                            First, the order will be contrary to the financial interests of the
                            island, because it will be the means of taking away from it a source of
                            revenue in the way of tonnage dues and port charges, as its enforcement
                            will prevent all foreign ships from continuing in the trade of catching
                            and carrying live fish to the Cuban markets.</p>
                        <p>That this would cause no small loss of revenue is clearly shown by the
                            fact that there have always been from sixteen to twenty-five vessels,
                            ranging from 32 to 46 tons, employed in carrying live fish to that
                            market in American bottoms alone, and making, on an average, twelve
                            trips every year. Each and every one of these vessels is obliged to pay
                            tonnage dues and port charges every time it enters port, and as a sample
                            of the amount paid by said vessels, I beg to present that of the
                            American schooner Relief, of only 32.43 tons, which pays as follows:

                        <p>Of the above sum at least $58.15 (the amount of tonnage dues and
                            custom-house charges) is Spanish revenue, and taking into consideration
                            the fact that the vessel in question makes twelve trips per year, she
                            alone pays into Spanish treasury of Cuba, every year, the sum of $697.80
                            in gold. As already stated, there are employed from sixteen to
                            twenty-five vessels, ranging from 32 to 46 tons each, and each one of
                            which averages twelve trips per year, and as a vessel pays tonnage dues
                            on her number of tons each trip, the revenue received from that source
                            amounts to a large sum. That revenue, as well as that received from
                            other foreign vessels, will be lost, if the order of the captain-general
                            of Cuba is continued in force, as no foreign vessel can afford to pay a
                            duty of $1.72 on every quintal (of 100 pounds) of fish imported into the
                            island, in addition to the tonnage dues and port charges, and compete
                            with Spanish vessels that are still allowed to enter their fish free of
                            duty. It is alleged that said duty amounts to actual prohibition.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, and not the least important matter for consideration, is the
                            fact that by the discriminating duty above referred to Mr. Antonio
                            Quintana Lopez, a Spanish subject, and who is also engaged in supplying
                            the Cuban markets with fish (and who, as it would seem, has been
                            instrumental in causing the order of the captain-general to be issued),
                            and his associates, would, by the withdrawal of foreign fishing vessels,
                            soon obtain a monopoly of those markets, thus causing a great increase
                            in the price of fish, if not placing that very important article of food
                            beyond the reach of the poor class of people in the island.</p>
                        <p>The above statement seems to show very clearly, first, that the
                            enforcement of the order of the captain-general will be the means not
                            only of taking away every year a large revenue from the Cuban treasury,
                            but, second, it will also tend to place the Cuban fish markets in the
                            hands of monopolists and thus cause a large increase in the price of
                            fish. While, as I have already stated to your excellency, it is not the
                            intention or wish of my government to interfere in the internal affairs
                            of His Catholic Majesty’s Government, or in those of His Catholic
                            Majesty’s colonies; I have been instructed to present the above
                            statement for its consideration, and should His Catholic Majesty’s
                            Government deem it wise and best to revoke the order of the
                            captain-general above referred to, such action would be received with
                            pleasure by the Government of the United States.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with the suggestion contained in
                        your instruction No. 55, in relation to charges made by Spanish consuls in
                        the United States on cargoes of vessels clearing for Spanish ports, I sought
                        an interview with the minister of state on the 10th instant, but found his
                        office closed. The attempt was renewed on the succeeding day without
                        accomplishing the object. I then sought and obtained an interview with the
                        sub-secretary, Mr. Mendez de Vigo.</p>
                    <p>I stated to him that no reply had been made to the note which I had the honor
                        to address to the minister of state on the 7th January last, relating to
                        charges made by Spanish consuls in the United States on the cargoes of
                        vessels clearing for Spanish ports; and I added that since the date of my
                        note I had received several dispatches from my government advising me that
                        the Spanish consuls in the United States were continuing to impose said
                        charges complained of, and that my government had instructed me to confer
                        with the ministry of state with a view to a prompt and early settlement of
                        the pending subject. I stated as impressively as I was capable of doing that
                        my government regarded the imposition of said charges as wrong in and of
                        themselves and embarrassing to the commerce between the two countries, and
                        that they were deemed inadmissible by my government as being in substance
                        and in fact a tonnage duty amounting to a revenue measure enforced <pb
                            n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0543"/>in American ports, and that no
                        government could assume to exercise that power but the Government of the
                        United States. I also invited the attention of the sub-secretary to the
                        correspondence of the two governments which took place when Mr. Cushing was
                        the United States minister at this court (referred to in my note of the 7th
                        January), involving very nearly, if not actually, the same point now under
                        discussion. Such briefly, but substantially, was the manner in which I
                        stated my views of the case to the sub-secretary, and expressed the hope
                        that there would be as little delay as possible in the disposition and
                        settlement of the subject-matter under consideration. The reply of the
                        sub-secretary was, first, that said consular charges were made alike upon
                        the cargoes of vessels in the ports of all nations, and that the Government
                        of of the United States was the only one that had complained of the same;
                        second, that they were considering the case with a view to determine the
                        same, but that the person having the matter in charge was temporarily
                        absent, but in a few days a reply to my note would be sent me. I then said
                        to the sub-secretary that without any instructions from my government I
                        would inquire of him if all the trouble and annoyance arising in the
                        consular service could not be wholly avoided, or very nearly so, if the two
                        governments would make an agreement by which the consular fees should be
                        alike, or reciprocal by each government? If he should be disposed to favor
                        such a course and would address me a note to that effect, I would submit the
                        same to my government.</p>
                    <p>At first the suggestion seemed to impress the sub-secretary very favorably
                        and he expressed the opinion that it was a desirable thing to do. But after
                        talking further upon the subject, he said that it could not be done, as the
                        consular systems of the two governments were based on different principles,
                        that the American consular system was not regarded as one of revenue, while
                        it was otherwise with Spain; that Spain relied largely upon its consular
                        system as one of revenue, and it was administered upon that principle, and
                        Spain did, in fact, realize a considerable sum from that service.</p>
                    <p>To that I promptly replied, precisely, and that sustains just the view
                        entertained by my government, that the charge upon cargoes of vessels was a
                        tonnage and revenue measure, and as such my government protested against it
                        as inadmissible. I then said to the sub-secretary, supposing that my
                        government should instruct its consular officers in Cuba and Porto Rico to
                        impose a like charge upon every pound of sugar and every gallon of molasses
                        sent to the United States, what would the Spanish Government say? He replied
                        by asking why my government did not do so? I responded, first, that such a
                        course, if admissible, would only provoke controversy, and would
                        substantially embarrass the commercial relations of both countries, while
                        everything that could properly be done should be done to facilitate and
                        increase that commerce, and that I would be happy if I could in any way aid
                        in so desirable a result. And, I added, secondly, that such a course was
                        wholly inadmissible. That no nation could allow any foreign government to
                        collect fees on the cargoes of vessels in its own ports equivalent to
                        tonnage or revenue duties, and if attempted would certainly prove disastrous
                        in its result. The sub-secretary made no reply.</p>
                    <p>It is now more than a week since said conference took place, and having as
                        yet received no reply to my note of January 7, I have deemed it proper to
                        advise you of said interview. When a reply shall be received to my note it
                        will be promptly forwarded.</p>

                        Government to the request that the governor-general of Cuba or the minister

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have had the honor to receive the
                            note which your excellency was pleased to address me, dated 8th instant,
                            relating to the incident which occurred to the American ship Ellie
                            Knight, and in which your excellency states that a certain discrepancy
                            appears to exist between the declaration made by the ministry of
                            ultramar and the direction-general of hacienda of Havana.</p>
                        <p>The consul of the United States at that place says that, on applying to
                            the direction-general of hacienda of Havana, as the charges imposed on
                            the master of the Ellie Knight appeared to him (the consul) rather
                            unreasonable and unjust, learned that in consequence of a royal order
                            recently promulgated in Cuba, the director-general of hacienda was no
                            longer authorized to determine questions of that kind.</p>
                        <p>I infer that a mistake has been made or that a misunderstanding
                            exists.</p>
                        <p>The minister of ultramar declares, according to the statement I had the
                            honor to make to your excellency in my note of 3d, that these cases must
                            be decided by the direction-general of hacienda of Havana, and in
                            support of this declaration he sends the inclosed copy of the general
                            customs regulations in force in the Island of Cuba, in which, title 4th,
                            chapter 3d, your excellency will see all the particulars of the
                            administrative procedure for the imposition of fines.</p>
                        <p>The administrators impose the fine when there is a just cause for it, and
                            if the party concerned does not conform itself thereto, and may appeal
                            in accordance with the provisions in force, he makes the appeal to the
                            direction-general of hacienda, which definitely determines such
                            questions, although the “contencioso administrativo” remains as a last
                            course.</p>
                        <p>If it were intended to remit the fines imposed or to modify in any way
                            the procedure, which is perhaps what the consul of the United States at
                            Havana refers, then the decision of such cases belongs to the government
                            of Madrid. The customs legislation in the provinces of ultramar being
                            alike applied to the native born and to foreigners, His Majesty’s
                            Government is unable to delegate, through any authority or
                            representative, the power to remit the penalties imposed for
                            infringements of the customs and tariff regulations, as it can alone
                            appreciate the circumstances which may advise the exercise of grace.
                            Thus I have answered at the same time the note of your excellency of
                            13th (March), in which you requested that the captain-general of Cuba or
                            the representative of Spain at Washington be authorized to deal with
                            such cases of fines which might arise in the Spanish colonies, and to
                            remit them when the facts should so justify.</p>
                        <p>I flatter myself that these explanations will be sufficient to convince
                            your excellency that both in the case of the Ellie Knight as in other
                            analogous ones, the Spanish administration has justly and strictly
                            adhered to the regulations in force, it being a matter of regret that
                            through the heedlessness or carelessness of the masters of vessels cases
                            of this kind are of so frequent occurrence.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to previous dispatches, and
                        particularly to my No. 41, relating to the charge made by Spanish consuls in
                        ports of the United States of ten cents per ton on the cargoes of vessels
                        clearing for Spanish ports, I now have the honor to inclose herewith, for
                        your further information, a copy of a note upon the subject, dated the 29th
                        ultimo, from the minister of state. It will be observed that the note of the
                        minister of state does not answer the question at issue. It merely states
                        that the charge which has been in force since 1874, in so far as vessels
                        clearing for the ports of the peninsula are concerned, is now being exacted,
                        in accordance with article 53 of the tariff, of vessels clearing for the
                        Spanish provincial ports, and that as the matter treats of the receipts of
                        the public treasury, no modification in regard thereto can be made without
                        being previously sanctioned by law.</p>
                    <p>It is presumed that this charge upon the cargoes of American vessels clearing
                        for peninsular ports may have been made, as stated, by his excellency, but
                        the commerce directly with Spain has been so limited that it escaped
                        attention, admitting the fact to be as stated. But now, when the attention
                        of the Spanish Government is called to what is the character of this
                        consular fee, and that it is in substance a tonnage duty, and equivalent to
                        a revenue measure, its reply is that it is now applying the same rules in
                        its provinces that have been in force in Spain since 1874. That surely is
                        not an answer to the point in issue. The exorbitant consular fees complained
                        of in 1876 were abolished by law. It would seem that a just solution of the
                        present difficulty should be made in the same manner.</p>
                    <p>I await such further instructions as you shall be pleased to give me.</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith also a copy of my note to his excellency the minister of
                        state, acknowledging the receipt of his note to me of the 29th ultimo.</p>

                            which your excellency was pleased to address me, dated January 7, and
                            February 17, ultimo, in which, in consequence of instructions from your
                            government, and on the application of some American merchant houses, you
                            protest against the measures adopted in the Spanish consulates
                            established in the United States, exacting, after the 31st October
                            ultimo, from vessels sailing for the provinces of ultramar, the same
                            consular duties as those levied upon vessels clearing for the ports of
                            the peninsula.</p>
                        <p>In support of said claim your excellency refers to what took place in the
                            year 1876, when the duties mentioned in articles 48, 49, 50, and 51 of
                            said tariff were abolished; but I must inform you that that suppression
                            was adopted in accordance with article 16 of the law of budgets
                            [presupuestos] of 2d July, 1876, because, it treating of a sum covered
                            into the treasury, the government of the King, my august sovereign, did
                            not find itself authorized to adopt resolutions of that nature without
                            the previous authorization of Congress.</p>
                        <p>In the place of said articles it was established that for the examination
                            of each invoice which the shippers must deliver to be included in the
                            manifest which the captains at the port of destination present in the
                            administration of customs, they will <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474"
                                facs="0546"/>pay 25 or 50 centimes, according to the port from
                            whence they come, for each ton of 1,000 kilograms or a fraction of a
                            ton, which charge has been paid since said year of 1876 without giving
                            rise to any claim from foreign governments.</p>
                        <p>This charge, which in either the one or other form mentioned, has been in
                            force since the year 1874 without any interruption, has not applied to
                            the navigation in the provinces of ultramar, because article 52 of the
                            tariff fixed the duty which must be paid to countersign the documents
                            exhibiting the cargo of the vessel (sobordo) which was the special
                            document demanded by the regulations of said provinces for the clearance
                            of the merchandise; but it was provided by article 53 that if, in
                            consequence of a reform in the system of carrying out the same
                            (“fiscalizacion en ellas”), the charge by consuls for countersigning the
                            documents exhibiting the cargo of the vessel (sobordos), should be no
                            longer exacted, foreign and Spanish vessels shall then be subjeet to the
                            regulations established for the ports of Spain. This case occurred when
                            the ministry of ultramar published the customs and tariff regulations
                            for the Islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, in which the documents
                            exhibiting the cargo of the vessel (sobordos) are abolished, and
                            provided that the manifests presented shall be made out in the same
                            manner as those for the peninsula.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will observe, therefore, that the question at issue is
                            not a new tax, but only one already anticipated in the regulations
                            establishing a perfect equality in regard to the payment of duties for
                            all merchandise imported into Spain and its provinces of ultramar. I
                            must further say that Spanish vessels are not only subject to its
                            payment, but that they also have to pay an additional tonnage duty from
                            which foreign vessels are exempt; and if Spain should reform its
                            regulations increasing, for instance, the charge for countersigning
                            invoices, as other nations do, it is obvious that commerce would have to
                            pay more than it pays at the present time. In view of these reasons I
                            flatter myself that your excellency will see that I am unable to accede
                            to your desire, the more so as the modification in the collection of all
                            taxes which form part of the receipts of the public treasury, cannot be
                            attempted without having been previously sanctioned by law.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to inclose herewith copy and
                            translation of a communication dated the 12th instant, received at this
                            office from Messrs. Fogarty &amp; Johnson and others, of Key West, Fla,
                            with copy of my reply thereto, dated 23d instant, in relation to the
                            live fish business that they have been carrying on with this port during
                            the last twenty-five years, and which has recently suffered interruption
                            by the imposition of an import duty by the government of this
                            island.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this communication to the consideration of the Department I
                            take it that it may not be inopportune if I accompany it with a brief
                            relation of facts partly orally acquired and partly from my own personal
                            knowledge, concerning the fisheries of Florida, and the introduction of
                            their products into the Havana market.</p>
                        <p>The fisheries of the western coast of that State for several generations
                            prior to its acquisition by the United States from Spain, in 1821, in
                            virtue of the treaty of 1819, had been the principal source of supply of
                            live fish for the inhabitants of Havana.</p>
                        <p>By that treaty, the live fish brought from Florida was denationalized and
                            became, in consequence, a merchandise of foreign production in Cuba. It
                            was, moreover, excluded from the Havana market by the ancient royal
                            orders of the kings of Spain which excluded all persons from fishing for
                            the purpose of trade but those (matriculados) who had already performed
                            services in their majesties’ ships of war or were inscribed in the lists
                            of the many offices to perform such service when called upon.</p>
                        <p>Thus by the joint action of the treaty and these royal orders, the people
                            of Florida engaged in the occupation of fishing lost their best market,
                            the inhabitants of the Havana losing at the same time their nearest and
                            most abundant source of fresh fish food.</p>
                        <p>Surreptitious means, however, were devised for the circumvention of the
                            barrier thus interposed between supply and demand.</p>
                        <p>Thus, soon after the transfer of Florida, a number of small sloops,
                            called smacks, were fitted out in Mystic and New London, in the State of
                            Connecticut, between parties in Havana and others in those towns for the
                            joint prosecution of this trade.</p>
                        <p>The modus operandi was thus: They carried two flags, one American and the
                            other Spanish, with corresponding registers and crew-lists; then, after
                            catching on the coast of Florida, under the American flag, their full
                            fares, they would set sail for Havana, where they would enter flying the
                            Spanish flag, reporting from some port of the coast of Cuba to the
                            westward of Havana or from the banks of Yucatan.</p>
                        <p>Through the influence of the monopolist Don Francisco Marty, into whose
                            hands the trade soon fell, it was in this manner carried on from about
                            the year 1823 to 1856.</p>
                        <p>In this latter year some of the master fishermen hailing from Mystic
                            determined that they would no longer bring the article for the price Mr.
                            Marty was assigning them, which was only five to six cents per pound,
                            while at the same time it was being retailed from his fish market in
                            this city at thirty to forty cents per pound.</p>
                        <p>They complained that Mr. Marty from a very poor and obscure position had
                            become a millionaire, due mainly to the monopoly he had acquired over
                            the sale of their merchandise, and what they had obtained from it had
                            scarcely been sufficient to cover their living expenses. Therefore, with
                            the double view of becoming independent of Mr. Marty and of reaping a
                            larger profit out of their business, they proposed to the government— <list>

                                <item>That they should be permitted to bring live fish into this
                                    port, under the American flag, free of all import duty.</item>
                                <label>2d.</label>
                                <item>They would pay on the measured tonnage of their vessel the
                                    regular tonnage dues and other customary port charges;
                                    and,</item>
                                <label>3d.</label>
                                <item>They offered to bind themselves never to sell by the cargo
                                    above 11 cents per pound.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>General Don José de la Concha y Gutierrez, was then captain-general of
                            the island, and to him the proposition was presented.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto the government had derived no revenue from the vessels plying
                            this trade, and the fishermen offered to pay tonnage and corresponding
                            port charges, such as interpreter, custom-house entry, captain of the
                            port’s fees, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The people of Havana, under the monopoly of Mr. Marty, were paying
                            exorbitant prices for the article. General Concha favored the proposal,
                            and referred it for examination to the very able economist Don Bonifacio
                            Cortes, then collector of this port, who in turn reported favorably.</p>
                        <p>Meantime Mr. Marty brought to bear against the measure all the power of
                            his influence, backed by the navy department; but public opinion
                            pronounced itself in its favor, and General Concha, after some months,
                            issued a provisional decree accepting the proposal of the fishermen with
                            the modification of striking out the fixed price <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0548"/>proposed, leaving this to be settled by
                            the competition of supply and demand, and fifty-five cargoes were
                            brought in under its provision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Marty then appealed to Madrid, and succeeded in obtaining a royal
                            order from Queen Isabel annulling the decree of General Concha, and the
                            trade in consequence was for a while totally stopped.</p>
                        <p>In consequence, another effort was made on the part of the agent of the
                            fishermen, and after an interval of six months another royal order was
                            obtained granting their petition, and since 1858 to the early part of
                            the present year the trade has been actively prosecuted with profit and
                            advantage to both producers and consumers, until practically prohibited,
                            as the signers of the accompanying communication aver, by the recent
                            order of General Prendergast, the present governor-general of the

                        <p>The undersigned, owners of schooners in this port, and which have been
                            engaged for many years in the importation of live fish from Florida to
                            Havana, each one of which paying into the treasury of Cuba more than
                            $200 in gold for tonnage dues, inspection, pilotage, &amp;c., which
                            charges we have always considered excessive, for the reason that no

                            States.</p>
                        <p>Lately, by the interference of certain speculators of that city, a new
                            and extra duty has been imposed, which, added to the existing duties,
                            amounts to $2.35 for each 100 pounds, or, in other terms, amounting to
                            the net profit we realize after so much labor during each month.</p>
                        <p>On and after the 1st day of April, the date of the issue of the said
                            decree, our vessels have been compelled to suspend their voyages on
                            account of the enormous dues thus imposed upon them, and we have in
                            consequence made a representation to the honorable the Secretary of
                            State, who has informed us that he has made a representation of our case
                            to the minister of the United States at the court of Madrid.</p>
                        <p>Since our vessels have abandoned their regular trips to the port of
                            Havana the price of live fish has been greatly enhanced, the poorer
                            classes can no longer afford to purchase it, and the treasury of the
                            island fails to receive the $200 which each of our twenty-one schooners
                            formerly paid into it every time they entered port, so that it will be
                            perceived that by the above operation our vessels are excluded from the
                            market of Havana, and the treasury loses the usual duties imposed, and
                            the poorer classes of Havana can no longer purchase fish because of the
                            monopoly imposed upon it.</p>
                        <p>We have lately read the telegram of the minister of ultramar regarding
                            the suppression of the differential duties now ruling, and as we believe
                            that it is not to be supposed that the new duty imposed on the 1st April
                            on live fish can be carried into effect, for the reasons we have already
                            stated herein, and as the measure is readily understood to be both
                            prejudicial to the inhabitants and to the treasury of Cuba, we therefore
                            apply to you in order that you address his excellency the
                            governor-general of the island, soliciting that he shall suspend the
                            enforcement of the new duty imposed on live fish on and after the 1st
                            day of April of the current year until the supreme government of Spain
                            shall decide the question subject of this memorial.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. James McKay, a citizen of the United
                        States, resident in Monroe County, Florida, and who is extensively engaged
                        in feeding and shipping cattle to Cuban markets, has recently brought to the
                        attention of the Department a practice pursued by the Spanish consul at Key
                        West in regard to shipments from that port to Havana and other Cuban ports
                        which results in annoyance, inconvenience, and serious losses to himself and
                        other American citizens engaged in similar business.</p>
                    <p>It appears from Mr. McKay’s letter of the 22d of June last to the Department,
                        that the Spanish consul at Key West in pursuance, as that officer alleges,
                        of instructions from his government, exacts and collects from Mr. McKay and
                        other American cattle-shippers forty cents a head on all cattle shipped by
                        them from the State of Florida to Cuba. This is in addition to the ordinary
                        and usual consular fees charged and collected for clearing the vessel,
                        certifying papers, and such other charges as may properly be made by the
                        consul in connection with such shipments. On these same cattle, when landed
                        on the island of Cuba, Mr. McKay and the other shippers situated like him
                        have to pay an import duty of six dollars per head. Of this import duty paid
                        in Cuba, however onerous it may be, they make no complaint, recognizing the
                        right of the Spanish Government to impose and collect within its own
                        territorial jurisdiction such duties as it may deem proper under its own
                        municipal laws, provided it does not transcend the limits of treaty
                        stipulations.</p>
                    <p>In the letter referred to, Mr. McKay transmits thirteen protests made by him,
                        before a notary public, in relation to as many shipments, giving in each
                        case the name of the vessel, the number of cattle in the cargo, the date of
                        shipment, and the gross amount of head tax charged on each shipment. Thus on
                        the 22d of April, 1882, on the steamship Alabama, from Key West to Havana,
                        four hundred and fifty-one head of cattle upon which he paid to the consul
                        in question one hundred and eighty dollars and forty cents, and so on
                        through all the others, varying only in the number of cattle in each cargo
                        and the gross amount of tax paid. A subsequent letter from McKay of the 19th
                        ultimo incloses ten similar documents. These twenty-three protests represent
                        as many shipments made by him from Key West to Havana between the 22d of
                        April and the 7th of August of the present year, and embracing 10,967 head
                        of cattle upon which Mr. McKay has paid to the Spanish consul at Key West,
                        at 40 cents a head, $4,386.80, and when the six dollars a head paid upon
                        their being landed at Havana ($65,802) is added, it is seen that this one
                        American shipper has been obliged to pay to the Spanish Government the sum
                        of $70,188.80 before he gets his cattle into the Cuban market.</p>
                    <p>It is not conceivable that the Government of Spain, a country whose history
                        and traditions are so intimately and so justly identified with the growth
                        and progress of the world’s commerce, could intend this charge of forty
                        cents a head as a restriction on the commerce of the United States. The long
                        and unbroken friendship existing between the two countries forbid such an
                        interpretation of the policy of His Catholic Majesty’s Government.</p>
                    <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0551"/>
                    <p>The charge, nevertheless, under whatever supposed right or necessity on the
                        part of Spain it may be imposed, is in effect such a restriction, and is a
                        burden so onerous on American citizens engaged in that rapidly increasing
                        branch of American commerce as must in time have the effect of excluding
                        them from the Spanish colonial markets of Cuba. It is a charge moreover upon
                        whatever ground it may be placed that is in itself anomalous. No other
                        government with which the United States holds commercial relations attempts
                        to make or enforce any similar tax or charge in the ports of the United
                        States, and it is almost superfluous to state that the consular officers of
                        the United States are not authorized to make any similar charges in the
                        ports of Spain or her transatlantic colonies on any goods, the produce of
                        those countries, destined for ports of the United States. The remedy for
                        this evil is with the Spanish Government. It may in its hands be made
                        simple, adequate, and immediate by putting an end to the practice, and in
                        the present case reimbursing to Mr. McKay the amount he has already paid,
                        which, as shown at present, is $4,386.80.</p>
                    <p>The alternative left to this government in case that of Spain shall fail to
                        give the subject prompt and just consideration, is one that is not
                        contemplated with satisfaction; that is, a similar charge on colonial
                        products of Spain shipped by Spanish subjects from the ports of their own
                        country to the United States. A simple statement of the present status of
                        the commerce between the United States and these colonies is sufficient to
                        show how detrimental such a measure would be to the commercial interests of
                        the colonial subjects of His Catholic Majesty.</p>
                    <p>In 1880 the imports of the United States were, from Cuba, $65,423,000; all
                        other Spanish colonial ports, $12,214,000. Exports from United States to
                        these same places in that year—Cuba, $11,000,000; to all other colonial
                        ports, $2,000,000. For 1881, exports from Cuba, $63,000,000; from all other
                        Spanish colonial ports, $12,000,000. Exports from the United States to Cuba,
                        $11,000,000.</p>
                    <p>You will take the earliest opportunity to bring this claim to the attention
                        of the Madrid Government, and in doing so you will take occasion to express
                        to the minister for foreign affairs the very earnest desire felt by the
                        President that the subject shall receive the prompt and just consideration
                        of that government, and you will lose no time in reporting the results of
                        your proceedings to the department in order that these may be early laid
                        before the President.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: About two months ago, I addressed the
                            Department on the subject of the exorbitant fees charged by Spanish
                            consuls upon our line of steamers plying between New Orleans and Havana.
                            I am in receipt of a letter from the managers of the company, under date
                            of 17th, from which I extract the following:</p>
                        <p>“We cleared one of our steamers for Havana to-day, and the Spanish consul
                            exacted ten cents a ton on all the cargo carried by the vessel as a
                            portion of his fees. This is a very heavy tax, and we are sure none such
                            is imposed on Spanish steamers by the American authorities.”</p>
                        <p>If there is any relief against such imposition, I respectfully invoke it
                            through your Department.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 52 of the 6th of June last
                        was duly received, though it does not appear to have been hitherto
                        acknowledged. It is accompanied by a copy of the note of the minister for
                        foreign affairs to you of the 29th of May, in which he seeks to justify the
                        tax. The Department concurs in the view of the matter taken in your
                        dispatch. That the application of the tax to vessels clearing to colonial
                        ports was a mere extension of a tax, exacted since 1874, to vessels clearing
                        for ports in the peninsula, seems to be an evasion of the point at issue.
                        Our complaint is that as our commercial intercourse with Spain is mainly
                        with her possessions in this hemisphere, exorbitant consular charges on
                        United States vessels and their cargoes bound to such ports are virtually an
                        export tax, which assuredly no foreign government can be allowed to exact in
                        our ports, especially as such a power has not been granted to this
                        government. If, however, as the minister says, it will be necessary for the
                        legislature of Spain to correct the evil of which we complain, it is hoped
                        that the executive government of that country will exert all proper
                        influence towards having the desired change effected. This is a measure
                        which may be deemed necessary, not only for improving commercial intercourse
                        between the two countries, but also for strengthening the good feeling
                        between them. It can never be expected that the people of this country will
                        acquiesce in the levy here <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0553"/>by the
                        agents of a foreign government of any charges which, in their amount or
                        character, may be tantamount to an export tax.</p>
                    <p>A controversy on a similar subject took place a few years since between this
                        government and that of Hayti. A copy of the two principal instructions in
                        regard to the subject from Mr. Evarts to the minister of the United States
                        in that country is transmitted for your information.</p>
                    <p>The Haytian Government ultimately repealed the obnoxious tax.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit a copy of two letters to this
                            Department, one of the 25th and the other of the 28th ultimo, from
                            Messrs. Wilson and Asmus of New York, complaining of the exorbitant fees
                            recently authorized by the Haytian Congress to be charged by their
                            consuls in foreign countries. From the list of those fees which the
                            writers furnish, their complaint seems to be well founded.</p>
                        <p>There does not seem to be any stipulation of the treaty between the
                            United States and Hayti which forbids the parties to exact consular fees
                            at their discretion; still these may be so high as virtually to
                            constitute a serious export duty. The Department is not prepared to say
                            that Messrs. Wilson and Asmus are correct in estimating that tax in this
                            case at ten per cent. on values shipped. If, however, it should be
                            anything like that amount, it would be a subject of just complaint by
                            merchants engaged in the trade. This complaint would in part have for
                            its basis the consciousness that while the United States Government
                            itself has no power to levy an export tax, it is virtually allowing a
                            foreign government to exact such a due within its own jurisdiction. It
                            may be true that this, like all other taxes, must ultimately be paid by
                            the consumer, but the form and spirit of the exaction seem objectionable
                            enough to warrant a remonstrance on your part, which you will
                            consequently address to that government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 23, of the 24th ultimo,
                            has been received. It is accompanied by the reply of the Haytian
                            minister for foreign affairs to your note objecting to the consular tax
                            of one per cent. on the value of merchandise exported from this country
                            to Hayti. The reasons assigned by that functionary in defense of the
                            policy of that tax are by no means deemed satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>It may be allowed that Hayti has a right to impose such duties upon
                            importations from abroad, as to her may seem expedient. Friendly nations
                            which hold intercourse with her, however, also have reason to expect
                            that this act of sovereignty will be exercised in her own dominions, and
                            that the invidious character or degree of the charge will not be sought
                            to be avoided by making her consuls in foreign countries tax-gatherers
                            there.</p>
                        <p>You will consequently protest against the tax adverted to as decidedly
                            offensive, at least in form, to this government, and express a hope that
                            the proper authority there may see the expediency of such further
                            legislation as may obviate the objections adverted to.</p>
                        <p>The British Government has applied to us to join with them in protesting
                            against the tax. It has not been thought advisable at present to accept
                            the invitation. You may, however, confer freely upon the subject with
                            the British representative there. Such conferences may make it more easy
                            to compass the common object.</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 19th ultimo I had the honor to receive
                        Mr. Davis’ instruction No. 94, in regard to a tax of forty cents per head
                        imposed by the Spanish consul at Key West upon cattle exported from that
                        port (by Mr. James McKay and other American shippers) to Havana and other
                        Cuban ports.</p>
                    <p>Having had cases involving the same principles, where Spanish consuls in the
                        United States had exacted ten cents on each and every ton of the cargo of
                        vessels clearing for Spanish ports, and having presented those cases to the
                        Spanish Government in a note to the minister of state dated the 7th January
                        last, as will be seen by referring to my dispatch <pb n="483"
                            xml:id="pg_483" facs="0555"/>No. 10, I was in some doubt as to the
                        manner in which I should submit the case referred to in Mr. Davis’ No. 94. I
                        therefore sent you a telegram dated the 20th September, of which the
                        following is the substance:</p>
                    <p>Have received your Nos. 94 and 95. My No. 10 embraces case exactly similar to
                        No. 95. The minister of state replying to the same transmitted with No. 52,
                        in effect refuses to put an end to those taxes. What shall I say in reply to
                        that note? Is not No. 94 exactly alike in principle, and are not the charges
                        of Spanish consuls in reality an export duty imposed in our ports as held in
                        my note to the minister of state, which communication was approved by your
                        No. 30? Is that principle now to be given up? Please send further orders.
                        Also observe my Nos. 41 and 75.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>To my telegram to you I received a reply of which the following is the
                        substance:</p>
                    <p>If the Spanish Government cannot remove the burdensome consular tax, request
                        them to seek for power from the legislature. Such a duty is particularly
                        disagreeable here, because this government has no authority to impose an
                        export duty.</p>
                    <p>Acting, therefore, upon Mr. Davis’ No. 94, and your telegram, on the 26th
                        September I fully presented the case to His Catholic Majesty’s Government in
                        a note to the minister of state of that date, a copy of which is herewith
                        inclosed for your information.</p>
                    <p>On the 6th instant, and consequently after I had so presented the case to the
                        Spanish Government, I had the honor to receive your instruction No. 97,
                        relating to the same case, and on a careful examination of instructions Nos.
                        94 and 97, I think my note to the minister of state of September 26 will be
                        found fully to cover, and complies with, each of said instructions.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that I requested prompt action upon the part of the Spanish
                        Government, but no reply has as yet been received, nor is it possible to say
                        when it will be.</p>
                    <p>Being about to retire from the legation, I have deemed it proper to advise
                        you of my action, and hoping that the same may meet with your approval.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: The attention of the Department of
                            State at Washington has recently been called by Mr. James McKay, a
                            citizen of the United States, resident in the State of Florida, and who
                            is extensively engaged in feeding and shipping cattle to the Cuban
                            markets, to a practice pursued by the Spanish consul at Key West, in
                            regard to shipments from that port to Havana and other Cuban ports,
                            which results in annoyance, inconvenience, and serious loss to Mr.
                            McKay, and to other American citizens engaged in similar business.</p>
                        <p>From the statement made to the Department of State by Mr. McKay it
                            appears that the Spanish consul at the above-mentioned port, in
                            pursuance, as he alleges, of instructions from His Catholic Majesty’s
                            Government, exacts and collects from Mr. McKay and other American
                            shippers the sum of forty cents per head on all cattle shipped by them
                            from the State of Florida. That charge is in addition to the ordinary
                            and usual consular fees charged and collected for clearing the vessel,
                            the certification of papers, and such other charges as may be properly
                            made by the consul in connection with such shipments. On these same
                            cattle, when landed in Cuba, the shippers have to pay an import duty of
                            six dollars per head; but of this import duty paid in Cuba, however
                            onerous it may be, they make no complaint, recognizing as they do, and
                            as does my government, the right of His Catholic Majesty’s Government
                                <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0556"/>to impose and collect
                            within its own territorial jurisdiction such duties as it may deem
                            proper under its own municipal laws, provided it does not transcend the
                            limits of treaty stipulations.</p>
                        <p>In presenting the case to the Department of State, in a letter dated the
                            22d June last, Mr. McKay submitted thirteen protests made by him before
                            a notary public in relation to thirteen shipments, giving in each case
                            the name of the vessels, the number of cattle in each cargo, the date of
                            shipment, and the gross amount of head-tax on each shipment. For
                            example, on the 22d of April last Mr. McKay shipped on the steamship
                            Alabama from Key West to Havana, four hundred and fifty-one head of
                            cattle, upon which he paid to the Spanish consul $180.40 in addition to
                            the usual consular fees. The same charge was exacted in all the other
                            shipments, varying only in the number of cattle and the gross amount
                            paid.</p>
                        <p>In a subsequent letter dated the 19th ultimo, Mr. McKay transmitted to
                            the Department of State ten more protests, making in all twenty-three
                            protests, and representing as many shipments of cattle made by him from
                            Key West to Havana between the 22d of April and the 7th of August of the
                            present year, embracing in all 10,967 head, upon which he (Mr. McKay)
                            has paid to the Spanish consul at the first above-mentioned port, at the
                            rate of forty cents per head, the sum of $4,386.80; and when the six
                            dollars per head paid upon the cattle on their being landed at Havana is
                            added it will be seen that this one American shipper has been obliged to
                            pay within the short space of four months to His Catholic Majesty’s
                            Government $70,188.80 before getting the cattle into the Cuban market.
                            Surely His Catholic Majesty’s Government cannot regard the extra
                            $4,386.80 paid by Mr. McKay as legitimate consular fees.</p>
                        <p>As before stated, Mr. McKay and the other American shippers of cattle at
                            Key West do not object to the regular consular fees for the clearance of
                            the vessel, nor to the six dollars per head paid upon the cattle on
                            arrival at a Cuban port, but they do object very naturally, and very
                            justly, to the imposition at Key West, a port of the United States, of a
                            tax over and above all regular charges, of forty cents per head on all
                            the cattle shipped.</p>
                        <p>This tax, I need not tell your excellency, call it by what name you may,
                            is no more nor no less than an export tax or duty levied by His Catholic
                            Majesty’s Government in a port of the United States, and does the
                            Government of His Catholic Majesty claim to itself the right to levy
                            taxes and collect revenue in the ports of a foreign country?</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will remember that on the 7th of January last I had the
                            honor to invite your attention to an extra charge of ten cents per ton
                            exacted in ports of the United States by Spanish consuls on the cargoes
                            of vessels clearing for Spanish ports. My government claimed and
                            maintained in that note that the charge in question was an export duty
                            levied in its ports by His Catholic Majesty’s Government, and as such
                            was inadmissible.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency was good enough to reply to that note, on the 29th of May
                            last, stating why such a charge was levied and collected. I transmitted
                            a copy of that note to Washington for the information of my government,
                            and I am now informed that the reasons of your excellency as therein set
                            forth are not satisfactory, and that the charges are inadmissible.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to point out to your excellency that the charge of
                            forty cents per head on cattle is precisely the same in principle as
                            that of ten cents per ton on the cargoes of vessels; in other and
                            perhaps plainer words, it is an export duty or tax levied by His
                            Catholic Majesty’s Government in the ports of the United States, and
                            therefore my government takes the same stand in regard to it that it
                            took in regard to the first above-mentioned tax or charge.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the two charges in question are substantially
                            the same, and of the further fact that the question was fully presented
                            and the objections of my government thereto plainly expressed in my note
                            of the 7th January last, little or nothing now remains to be said in
                            regard to the matter further than that the case of Mr. McKay and of the
                            other American shippers of cattle at Key West aggravates the questions,
                            and beside the principle involved, the tax referred to is extremely
                            obnoxious not only to merchants in the United States engaged in
                            commercial pursuits with Spanish ports, but also to the Government of
                            the United States, and therefore my government expects that that of His
                            Catholic Majesty will take immediate steps to do away with these
                            objectionable, offensive, and inadmissible charges, and in the present
                            case to return to Mr. McKay the amount ($4,386.80) paid by him to the
                            Spanish consul at Key West, as head-tax on the several shipments of
                            cattle already made.</p>
                        <p>My government is unable to believe that the Government of His Catholic
                            Majesty, whose history and traditions are so intimately and so justly
                            identified with the growth and progress of the world’s commerce, will
                            insist in the continuance of a system (before unheard of in the world’s
                            history) which has for an object the collection of revenue in the ports
                            of a foreign government, and it therefore has no doubt that upon a
                            reconsideration of the subject, its request in the matter will be
                            willingly and speedily complied with. Such charges are imposed by the
                            consuls of no other nation.</p>
                        <p>If, as intimated in the note of your excellency of the 29th May last, it
                            is necessary <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0557"/>to obtain the
                            authorization of the Cortes to enable the Government of His Catholic
                            Majesty to comply with the request of that of the United States, I am
                            instructed to ask, through your excellency, that such authorization may
                            be obtained from that body.</p>
                        <p>I am also instructed to state to your excellency that if such
                            authorization is necessary, and if the Cortes decline to grant it, that
                            there will then remain to the United States but one course to pursue.
                            That course will be the levying of a similar charge on colonial products
                            of Spain, shipped by Spanish subjects from the ports of their own
                            country to the United States. This would be the exercise of a power not
                            claimed by my government except in retaliation of the same power
                            wrongfully exercised by the Government of His Catholic Majesty, and I
                            need hardly tell your excellency that such a course is not contemplated
                            with satisfaction by the Government of the United States; and the
                            following simple statement of the present status of the commerce between
                            the United States and the Spanish colonies will be sufficient to show
                            how detrimental such a course would be to the colonial subjects of His
                            Catholic Majesty.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1880 the exports of Cuba to the United States amounted to
                            $65,423,000 and from all other Spanish colonial ports $12,214,000,
                            making in all $77,637,000. The exports of the United States for the same
                            year to Cuba amounted to $11,000,000, and to all other colonial ports
                            $2,000,000, making in all $13,000,000, and showing a difference in favor
                            of His Catholic Majesty’s subjects of $64,637,000.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1881 the exports from Cuba to the United States amounted to
                            $63,000,000 and from all other Spanish colonial ports $12,000,000,
                            making in all $75,000,000. The exports from the United States to Cuba
                            for the same year amounted to $11,000,000, and to all the other Spanish
                            colonial ports $2,000,000, making in all $13,000,000, and showing a
                            difference in favor of His Catholic Majesty’s subjects of
                            $62,000,000.</p>
                        <p>As before stated, the above simple statement will show to your excellency
                            how very detrimental it would be to the interests of His Catholic
                            Majesty’s subjects in Cuba and in other Spanish colonial possessions,
                            should the Government of the United States find itself obliged to
                            retaliate by imposing upon the products exported from those possessions,
                            a tax or charge similar to that now imposed and collected by Spain in
                            the ports of the United States on merchandise shipped to Spanish ports.
                            But the President earnestly and sincerely hopes that the United States
                            will not be called upon to take this step of retaliation, and he
                            entertains the firm belief, in view of the long and unbroken friendship
                            which has existed between the two countries, as well as of the great
                            commercial interests involved, that His Catholic Majesty’s Government
                            will not insist upon the continuance of these objectionable and
                            offensive charges, but will readily and willingly take such steps as
                            will do away with them at an early day.</p>
                        <p>In presenting this subject again to the attention of your excellency I am
                            also instructed to ask that it may receive that prompt and just
                            consideration which its importance demands; and I am likewise instructed
                            to transmit at once to Washington the reply of His Catholic Majesty’s
                            Government thereto, for the information and action of the President.</p>
                        <p>I gladly avail myself, &amp;c.,</p>

                        of Mr. Hunter’s instruction No. 95, relating to the exaction by the Spanish
                        consul at New Orleans often cents per ton on all the cargo carried by a
                        vessel from that port to Havana.</p>
                    <p>This is in all respects precisely like the cases which were presented to His

                        same as the case set forth in instructions Nos. 94 and 97.</p>
                    <p>Having presented the argument to His Catholic Majesty’s Government in my note

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: Referring to my note of the 26th
                            instant, relating to the extra charge of forty cents per head levied and
                            collected by the Spanish consul at Key West, Florida, on all cattle
                            shipped by American citizens to the Island of Cuba, and to the ten cents
                            per ton levied and collected by Spanish consuls in the ports of the
                            United States on the cargoes of vessels clearing for Spanish ports, I
                            have now the honor to inform your excellency that I have received from
                            my government a further instruction relating to the last mentioned
                            charge, exacted by the Spanish consul at New Orleans on the cargo of a
                            vessel belonging to an American line of steamers recently cleared from
                            that port for Havana.</p>
                        <p>As the facts presented in my notes of the 7th January last and of the
                            26th instant equally apply to this case, it is not necessary for me, at
                            this time, to further argue the question, but I may be permitted to add
                            that this latter complaint, together with others that are constantly
                            being presented to the Departmens of State at Washington, will further
                            show to your excellency how very objectionable and offensive these extra
                            charges are to the merchants and shippers of the United States, as well
                            as to my government; and it, therefore, confidently relies upon the
                            prompt action His Catholic Majesty’s Government to do away with these
                            charges, and to return, in this latter case, the amount which has been
                            demanded and collected by the Spanish consul at New Orleans.</p>
                        <p>I gladly avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency,

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Hamlin’s No. 100, of the 12th ultimo, has
                        been received. His course in presenting our complaint against the consular
                        fee of forty cents per head on cattle shipped from our ports to the Antilles
                        (as set forth in Mr. Davis’ No. 94) as resting on the same basis as the
                        previous complaint concerning the exaction of a consular fee of ten cents
                        per ton on invoiced cargo, conforms to the intention of the department; and
                        his note of 26th of September to the Marquis de la Vega is approved as a
                        forcible, and, it is hoped, conclusive exposition of our case.</p>
                    <p>The two classes of charge are of the same nature, and are opposed by us as
                        being a revenue charge levied in our ports, not for services rendered by the
                        consul or proportionate to such services, but as in effect an export tax. It
                        cannot adequately be met by saying (as has been said in past discussion)
                        that our consular fees for authenticating invoices may, when these are
                        numerous, amount to a heavy charge, exceeding that in the case of a single
                        moderate cargo when comprised in one invoice and assessed at ten cents a
                        ton. The service performed by the consul is one required by law for the
                        protection of the revenue <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0559"/>at the
                        port of entry, and involves ascertainment of the bona fides and
                        responsibility of the exporter, and the substantial accuracy of the
                        statements contained in the invoice and sworn declaration therewith. This
                        service is uniform in all cases, and neither the consul’s labor nor his
                        responsibility are measurable by the weight of the merchandise invoiced or
                        the number of pieces of which it is composed. It would apparently be as
                        tenable for Spanish legislation to assess an ad valorem tax for the
                        verification of an invoice. No basis of consular fees which depends on the
                        weight, size, amount, or value of the merchandise, and disregards the
                        specific clerical or administrative act done, can be in principle anything
                        short of an export tax levied in the jurisdiction of another State.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the head tax of forty cents on cattle, a point remains on
                        which you may find it appropriate to seek information. That tax first
                        appears in the consular tariff of July 15, 1874, article 51. By a royal
                        order of October 18, 1876, that article (with articles 48, 49, and 50) was
                        suppressed, and substituted by a uniform consular fee on verifying invoices
                        of five cents in Europe and ten cents in America per ton or fraction of a
                        ton. And a further circular royal order of October 7, 1881, directed that
                        the fees on invoices for Cuba and Porto Rico should follow the modification
                        of articles 48 to 51, inclusive, contained in the said royal order of
                        October 18, 1876. In the absence of knowledge of any later order, it is not
                        perceived why the head tax of forty cents is levied, instead of the uniform
                        tax of ten cents per ton weight. While both charges are alike objectionable
                        in principle, a tonnage tax on cattle would be the lesser in amount, and you
                        may use this circumstance as argument in showing, not only the identity of
                        our complaints in the case of tonnage and head tax, but also as evidencing a
                        disposition to make the charge effectively an export charge for revenue by
                        so assessing it as to yield in any given case the largest return.</p>
                    <p>It is noticed that Mr. Hamlin speaks, in his note to the minister, of the
                        charge of forty cents per head being collected in addition to all other
                        consular charges. This may be somewhat inaccurate if it should appear that
                        the charge is the only one levied on verifying an invoice. It is understood
                        to be distinct from and additional to all other charges on manifests,
                        clearances, and other ship’s papers.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In view of the large and increasing emigration
                        of foreign-born persons to the United States and the augmented military
                        armaments of the European nations, resulting in more stringent regulations
                        as to military service and obligations, the question of American naturalized
                        citizenship is assuming increased importance, and necessarily will demand
                        more attention and vigilance on the part of diplomatic and consular agents
                        of the United States in foreign countries. It therefore seems to <pb n="488"
                            xml:id="pg_488" facs="0560"/>me proper that I should report to the
                        Secretary of State two cases as to which I have been called to take
                        action—one in Sweden and the other in Norway.</p>
                    <p>C. M. Cedergren was born in Munsteras, Sweden, September, 1845, and emigrated
                        from the country in June, 1864. He became a naturalized citizen of the
                        United States February 28, 1880, in Washington Territory, having taken out
                        his preliminary paper in 1877. In 1881 he came on a visit to the vicinity of
                        his birth for the first time after an absence of seventeen years, having in
                        his possession his certificate of naturalization, which was in due form. Not
                        long after his return he was called on by a local Swedish official and a
                        fine demanded of him for a non-performance of military duty. The Swedish law
                        does not demand military service of the subject until he is twenty-one years
                        of age. Cedergren was less than nineteen years of age at the time of his
                        emigration, more than two years before he would have been liable to military
                        service had he remained in the country. He informed the officer that he was
                        a naturalized citizen of the United States and could show his naturalization
                        paper. Being in Stockholm not long after, if he did not come here for the
                        express purpose, early in August, 1881, he called on the United States
                        consul, Colonel Elfwing, for information and advice. Consul Elfwing brought
                        the case to my consideration.</p>
                    <p>I directed him to have Cedergren certify under oath as to his age at the time
                        of his emigration and the date of his departure from the country to show his
                        naturalization paper to the Swedish local official, to be respectful in his
                        demeanor to the Swedish officials, to pay no fines, and not to go to the
                        military drill. Cedergren certified under oath before the consul as to the
                        time of his emigration and his age at that date. Nothing more was heard from
                        him until nearly the close of March of the present year. He then wrote from
                        his place of temporary domicile that he had just been called on by the
                        district official, his fine for past delinquency demanded, and ordered to
                        appear April 14, for military service. He had then been in the country since
                        his return from the United States less than one year and had from the
                        beginning declared his purpose to leave during the present year. He at once
                        wrote Consul Elfwing of the new and imperative demand made on him, saying
                        that the Swedish official would not even look at his United States
                        naturalization paper. Consul Elfwing promptly communicated with me, and I
                        instructed him to write Cedergren to pay no fine and not to go to the
                        military drill, and this instruction the consul at once complied with</p>
                    <p>I deemed it my duty to make known the facts of the case to His Majesty’s
                        minister of foreign affairs, and to secure his intervention before April 14,
                        the date of the beginning of the demanded military service. To secure prompt
                        action and to more surely avoid awakening sensibilities, knowing how keenly
                        the leading men of the country feel in regard to the large draft now being
                        made on their population by emigration, I deemed it expedient not to make a
                        formal demand by written communications, but to call in person on His
                        Majesty’s minister, Baron Hochschild, state the facts verbally, and adjust
                        the case in as informal a manner as possible. Accordingly I called on the
                        minister of foreign affairs and gave him a full statement of the facts, laid
                        before him the letters of Mr. Cedergren, in which he had stated his
                        griveance, and informed him that the naturalization certificate of Cedergren
                        was correct and in due form. I called the minister’s attention to the treaty
                        of 1869 between the United States and Sweden and Norway, and expressed the
                        opinion that according to its terms Cedergren was free of all liabilities as
                        to Swedish obligations. He gave me a candid hearing, and said he <pb n="489"
                            xml:id="pg_489" facs="0561"/>would confer with the minister of justice,
                        to whose cognizance the ease properly came, and I would be promptly informed
                        of the conclusion reached. Two or three days after I received a note from
                        Baron Hochschild to the import that the minister of war had ordered
                        Cedergren’s name to be stricken from the conscription roll, as he was
                        indisputably an American citizen, but as he had not taken his first step to
                        naturalization until 1877, his naturalization could not have a retroactive
                        effect, and that therefore he was still liable to Sweden for his military
                        fine imposed for his prior delinquency.</p>
                    <p>Believing that this decision had been arrived at without sufficient
                        examination of the terms of the treaty, and that a verbal statement of the
                        case would be less embarrassing and more speedy in its result, as soon as
                        practicable I sought another personal interview with the minister of foreign
                        affairs. With him I reviewed the language of the treaty and protocol of
                        1869. I called to his consideration the discussion between the United States
                        and France in 1859 and 1860 relating to the case of Michel Zeiter, in which
                        our government claimed that the naturalized citizen could be held
                        responsible on his return to his native country only for liability incurred
                        prior to his emigration; that the French judicial tribunal finally decided
                        the case of Zeiter in favor of the United States, and without any treaty on
                        the subject; that the object of the treaties of naturalization which we had
                        with Sweden and Norway and other nations was to shut out all chance for
                        controversy on the essential point relating to Cedergren. I informed the
                        minister of foreign affairs that in 1879 and 1880 we had nearly forty cases
                        similar to that of Cedergren with Germany, with which we had a similar
                        treaty, and that in ail these cases where there was no military liability
                        before and at the date of emigration Germany admitted our claim.</p>
                    <p>To this interview with the minister of foreign affairs I took and read the
                        circular of the German minister of interior of July, 1868, with which the
                        circular of the German minister of justice, of the same year, was in entire
                        accord, which contained the instructions to the local German officials,
                        fully sustaining the construction of the treaty which I urged. After hearing
                        my presentation of the case and carefully re-examining the text of the
                        treaty and protocol, Baron Hochschild frankly declared my construction
                        correct, and the case of Cedergren clear of Swedish claim of liability.</p>
                    <p>In the evening of the same day April, 8 I received his official note fully
                        covering the conclusion reached in our verbal consideration of the case, and
                        remitting the fine which had been imposed on Cedergren, thus acknowledging
                        his unqualified American citizenship.</p>
                    <p>Late in November, 1880, I received a letter from Peder Sigbjornsen, Skoland,
                        district of Stavanger, Norway, where he was then stopping with his father,
                        saying that he was a citizen of the United States on a visit among his
                        relatives and friends, and intended to return to his adopted country in
                        1881. He forwarded to me his naturalization certificate which was in due
                        form and properly authenticated. He informed me that his American
                        citizenship had been disregarded by the Norwegian officials. As he had not
                        in this communication furnished me all the necessary data to enable me to
                        take action in his behalf, I wrote him for further information as to the
                        regiment in which and the names of the officers under whom he was called to
                        perform military service. Some time expired before he received my
                        communication, as it did not go to the post-office at which he was
                        accustomed to receive his letters. The distance of his place of domicile was
                        about four hundred miles from this legation. It was not until early in
                        March, 1881, that <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0562"/>I was able to
                        present the case to the foreign office of His Majesty’s Government, which
                        took the necessary steps to investigate the case through the Norwegian
                        officials. Sigbjornsen was found to be a native of Norway who had lived
                        eight years in the United States, and had been naturalalized as a citizen of
                        the latter country. He had returned to Norway in April, 1879, and was
                        residing with his father in the autumn of 1880, when the military
                        authorities demanded of him military service. This he refused declaring
                        himself a citizen of the United States. But it did not appear that he showed
                        his naturalization paper to the Norwegian authorities. He was fined for
                        non-performance of military duty, and paid the fine. Afterwards he was
                        informed by the Norwegian officials that he would be required to perform
                        military service early in 1881, as a Norwegian subject. In the sequel there
                        was found to be some conflict of statement and some evident misunderstanding
                        as to the facts in the case between Sigbjornsen and the Norwegian local
                        military authorities. As the acting minister of foreign affairs, Mr.
                        Lagesheim, and the Norwegian minister of state, Mr. Kierulf, residing
                        officially in Stockholm, seemed ready to act equitably in the case, I
                        suggested it might be informally adjusted, and this suggestion was accepted.
                        By the express terms of the treaty of 1869, Sigbjornsen could remain two
                        years in Norway without rendering himself liable to be claimed as a
                        Norwegian subject. The two years had now nearly expired. But in view of the
                        fact that his American citizenship had been disregarded for the period of
                        several months, and a fine imposed on him, it was agreed that he might
                        remain in Norway until August 24, 1881, about two years and five months in
                        all, after his return from the United States, and his fine refunded him. I
                        had contended that he was entitled to <hi rend="italic">two years of
                            unmolested residence</hi> in Norway as a citizen of the United States,
                        and that during the time in which military pressure had been made on him and
                        the fine remained enforced against him, he had not had unmolested residence
                        as an American citizen. This informal adjustment of the case seemed to me
                        equitable, and was accepted as satisfactory by the Norwegian minister and
                        the acting minister of foreign affairs, Baron Hockschild being then absent
                        from his post on leave.</p>
                    <p>I have given thus somewhat minutely an account of these two cases of disputed
                        citizenship and the manner of their adjustment, because, so far as I know,
                        these are the first which have arisen, as to which this legation has been
                        called to take action, since the going into effect of the treaty of 1869,
                        and because they may serve as precedents for the settlement of future cases
                        of like character which can scarcely fail to arise more often in the future.
                        And in this connection I can bear testimony to the courtesy and good faith
                        with which the Swedish and Norwegian ministers of His Majesty’s Government
                        dealt with the issues raised, when they had the opportunity fully to
                        consider them.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The consul at Smyrna, Mr. B. O. Duncan, sent
                        me, some days ago, a communication touching the imposition by the Turkish
                        authorities in that city of an extraordinary duty upon alcohol. The case
                        arose in course of the business of Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme, merchants
                        and representatives of a Boston firm entitled Laforme &amp; Frothingham.</p>
                    <p>Under §4, Consular Regulations 1881, I referred the papers to Consul-General
                        Heap for his consideration and action, and he returned them to me. Copies
                        are herewith inclosed.</p>
                    <p>After an examination of the treaty of commerce between Turkey and the United
                        States and the agreed specified duty upon the article in question, it seemed
                        plain that the additional duty demanded was unwarranted; and as the alcohol
                        was of American manufacture I thought it my duty to present the matter to
                        the Porte. My communication addressed to his excellency the minister of
                        foreign affairs is also inclosed herewith. The demand made, you will
                        observe, has reference to the language of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>As the in closures contain a full and particular statement of the affair, I
                        think it superfluous to enter into further explanation. Hoping my action

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to call your attention to
                            a new regulation of the Turkish customs first put in force at the
                            custom-house here, which I think you will agree with me in regarding as
                            a manifest and intentional violation of Article V of our treaty of
                            commerce with the Ottoman Empire. That article clearly provides that
                            with the exception of <hi rend="italic">tobacco and salt</hi> “that
                            duties to be imposed on every article the produce or manufacture of the
                            United States of America, imported into the the empire and possessions
                            of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, shall in <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
                            case exceed one fixed rate of 8 per cent. ad valorem, or a specific
                            duty, fixed by common consent, equivalent thereto”; and also that
                            “neither the buyer nor the seller shall he charged with any further duty
                            with respect to them.”</p>
                        <p>The equivalent of the 8 per cent. “fixed by common consent” for alcohol,
                            which is one of the most important articles of American production
                            imported here, is 16 <hi rend="italic">paras per oke</hi>, of 2¾ English
                            pounds. As you will see from the letter of Messrs. Reggio &amp;
                            Belhomme, prominent merchants of this place, a translation of which I
                            inclose <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0564"/>the custom-house here
                            now demands of them the payment of 48 paras per oke as a <hi
                                rend="italic">fiscal</hi> duty, as it calls it, over and above the
                            former <hi rend="italic">custom-house</hi> duty of 16 paras; that is 64
                                <hi rend="italic">paras</hi> per oke, or 32 per cent, ad valorem,
                            just four times the duty allowed in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Note, too, that Article XIV of this new regulation speaks of 32 <hi
                                rend="italic">paras</hi> increase, whereas the actual increase
                            demanded by the custom-house here is 48 paras, and of 60 <hi
                                rend="italic">paras</hi> in case the goods are placed in a store,
                            whereas the actual demand is for 90 paras. This difference is explained
                            by the custom-house as being made on private instructions from
                            Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>I cannot myself see any possible way of reconciling this new regulation
                            with the language of our treaty, and that of the French treaty which I
                            have seen is in almost exactly the same words as ours. It is presumed
                            that the change has grown out of the financial negotiations now pending
                            at Constantinople. But if so, it should certainly not have been put in
                            force until fully agreed upon and sanctioned by all the powers including
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The fact that Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme are not Americans—they are
                            French—I presume has nothing to do with the matter, as they represent
                            here an American house of Boston. The language of our treaty is as to
                            the rights of American “produce and manufactures,” and must, I suppose,
                            be equally applicable whether imported into Turkey by an American or a
                            foreigner.</p>
                        <p>I submit the case for your consideration and action according as you may
                            see fit and proper under the circumstances. I have taken no steps here
                            except to write to the governor-general, Ali Pasha, quoting the
                            above-cited passage of our treaty, and entering my protest against its
                            violation.</p>
                        <p>I shall also immediately report the case fully to the Department of
                            State, sending my report first to you, to forward with any additional

                            to give me for my guidance as early as possible.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The undersigned, Reggio &amp; Belhomme,
                            merchants established in this city, representatives of Messrs. Laforme
                            &amp; Frothingham, of Boston, have the honor to represent to you that
                            having imported some alcohol from the United States, the direction of
                            the “indirect contributions” at Smyrna refuse to deliver it to them for
                            the purpose of sale on the market, on the payment of the custom-house
                            duty of 16 paras per oke as fixed by the treaty of commerce.</p>
                        <p>It claims a supplementary duty of 48 paras the oke, according to a new
                            regulation for the sale of spirits, prepared at Constantinople, and of
                            which a copy is herewith inclosed.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned recommend to your attention Article 14 of this regulation
                            fixing the new duty at 32 paras the oke, and not 48 paras, which the
                            direction at Smyrna demands.</p>
                        <p>In addition, they beg you to remark that the new duty of 48 paras the oke
                            is payable at the custom-house, at the game time as the old duty of 8
                            per cent. If the alcohol <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0565"/>is
                            sold on the market after having been in the stores of the undersigned,
                            without the payment of the duty of 48 paras the oke, then the duty is
                            raised to 90 paras the oke (instead of 60 paras as given in Article 14
                            of Regulations).</p>
                        <p>To resume, up to the present the undersigned have paid the single and
                            unique duty of 16 paras the oke on alcohol, and have had the faculty
                            (right) to sell it freely on the market.</p>
                        <p>Since the 21st of October, N. S., 1881, in order to have these same
                            advantages, the old duty of 16 paras the oke is required of them, and in
                            addition the new duty of 48 paras, in all 64 paras the oke, or a duty of
                            32 per cent, instead of 8 per cent., paid heretofore, and all that is
                            recognized by the existing treaties of commerce.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, finding themselves under the necessity of paying this
                            duty of 64 paras the oke on a lot of 77 barrels of alcohol, which they
                            could not allow to remain longer on the quays of the custom-house
                            exposed to all kinds of risks, protest against this new state of
                            affairs, for the damages which have already arisen and which may result
                            therefrom, which they receive to themselves to establish with all
                            necessary evidence, and they beg you to intervene with the minister of
                            the United States at Constantinople to have instructions sent to the
                            direction of the indirect contributions at Smyrna not to insist longer
                            on the collection of this new duty of 46 paras the oke, and that it be
                            limited to the old duty of 8 per cent, or 16 paras the oke, this being
                            the only duty sanctioned by the treaties of commerce in force.</p>
                        <p>They have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to ask your attention to
                            a matter which is the subject of an official report to this legation
                            from the American consul at Smyrna.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme, merchants of Smyrna, are representatives
                            of Messrs. Laforme &amp; Frothingham, of Boston, United States of
                            America. In course of their business, the latter consigned seventy-seven
                            barrels of alcohol to the former. Upon the arrival of the goods at
                            Smyrna the direction of the indirect contributions refused to deliver
                            them for the purpose of sale on the market, for a reason heretofore
                            unheard of and clearly unwarranted. Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme
                            tendered payment of the usual customs duty of 16 paras the oke, which
                            was the amount fixed by the agreed tariff upon alcohol under the treaty
                            of commerce between Turkey and the United States. The direction declined
                            the tender, and demanded a supplementary duty of 48 paras the oke,
                            giving as a reason that they were acting in accordance with a new
                            regulation for the sale of spirits prepared at Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme at first resisted the demand, but were at
                            length driven to payment at the rate of 64 paras the oke. They made the
                            payment under protest, reserving the right to claim damages then
                            accrued, and such as might thereafter accrue.</p>
                        <p>Investigation of the affair was at once instituted by the American consul
                            at Smyrna, which brought to the surface some new regulations said to
                            have been prepared and sent down from Constantinople; amongst them one
                            numbered Article 14, against which he promptly protested.</p>
                        <p>Apropos this statement of facts, I have the honor to ask that the
                            direction of indirect contributions at Smyrna be required to suspend the
                            further execution of the said Article 14, in so far as it has any effect
                            upon any article of production or manufacture in the United States of
                            America, imported into the empire and possessions of His Imperial
                            Majesty the Sultan; that as respects even articles the produce or
                            manufactures of the United States of America, whether in the hands of a
                            buyer or seller in His Majesty’s empire, the said Article 14 be entirely
                            canceled and revoked; and in particular that the duties upon alcohol be
                            returned and limited to the rate of 16 paras the oke. As Messrs. Reggio
                            &amp; Belhomme have reserved the right of making demand for damages
                            sustained by them in this business, no claim of that nature is now
                            presented to your consideration.</p>
                        <p>To obtain the relief asked I think it only necessary to present two
                            points for consideration, and those in the briefest manner.</p>
                        <p>First. The Article 14, new regulations referred to, is in palpable
                            violation of Article V of the treaty of commerce between the United
                            States and the Ottoman Empire. Article V of the treaty, with exception
                            of tobacco and salt, provides that His Majesty engages that the duties
                            to be imposed on every article, the produce or manufacture Of the United
                            States of America, imported into the empire and possessions of His
                            Imperial Majesty the Sultan, shall in no case exceed one fixed duty of 8
                            per centum ad valorem <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0566"/>on a
                            specific “duty fixed by common consent, equivalent thereto,” and also,
                            that “neither the buyer nor the seller shall be charged with any further
                            duty with respect to them.”</p>
                        <p>Under the common-consent clause of the Article V the specific duty agreed
                            to be fixed upon the item alcohol is 16 paras per oke of 2¾ English
                            pounds, that rate having been accepted as the equivalent of the 8 per
                            cent, recited in the treaty. (See tariff, Turkish and American.)</p>
                        <p>In the face of this plain treaty provision the Article 14 of the
                            regulations proposes to collect on alcohol, in addition to the
                            custom-house duty (of 16 paras), another fiscal duty of 32 paras cash
                            per oke; that is, 48 paras in all.</p>
                        <p>To make the imposition worse, there is a clause in the article objected
                            to, evidently of a penal character, providing that in a certain
                            contingency the so-called fiscal duty shall be increased to 60 paras.
                            The word fiscal applied descriptively to the new duty can be of no
                            assistance in giving validity to the measure as against the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Second. Turning in the next place to the operation of the Article 14, as
                            it was exemplified in this case by the direction of indirect
                            contributions in Smyrna, it appears from the report given by the
                            American consul that before the Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme could get
                            the 77 barrels of alcohol they were compelled to and did pay in all at
                            the rate of 64 paras the oke. When in protest they represented that
                            Article 14 stopped at 48 paras (the goods not having been put in store),
                            and asked the authorities demanding 64 paras; they were told that it was
                            according to private instructions from Constantinople. This fact is
                            given your excellency without comment further than that it indicates a
                            tendency to lawlessness, which I do not doubt will be promptly
                            checked.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: When, after addressing the demand to the Porte
                        for the execution of Ali, the murderer of Rev. Mr. Parsons (see dispatch No.
                        22, October 22), I set about preparing a paper to cover the further
                        instructions in your dispatch No. 3, I could find nothing on file touching
                        eight cases of robbery, &amp;c., of missionaries in His Majesty’s dominions.
                        Only five cases seemed to have been reported, including the matter of Rev.
                        Mr. Knapp, which has to do with a purchase of real property, and is, as I am
                        now informed, <hi rend="italic">pendente lite</hi> on appeal to some
                        superior court.</p>
                    <p>On this I requested Mr. Bliss, of Constantinople, who seems to be the active
                        agent of the American missionaries in general, to send me a statement of all
                        cases of the kind in his knowledge. To-day Mr. Pettibone replies for Mr.
                        Bliss. A copy of his letter is inclosed herewith.</p>
                    <p>Of the cases reported by Mr. Pettibone, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5 were never
                        communicated to the legation. There being no particulars about them at hand,
                        it is not possible for me to decide if they are cases proper for
                        presentation and demand under your instructions.</p>
                    <p>Of the others—No. 4, Rev. J. W. Parsons—the case is in form of a demand for
                        the execution of Ali, the murderer. In an interview had yesterday the
                        minister of foreign affairs assured me I would have answer about the
                        execution in a few days—probably to-morrow. He gave me no indication of the
                        purport of the reply.</p>
                    <p>No. 6. Rev. Mr. Barnum is also concluded. The victim got back his property
                        and the robbers are reported to have been all killed.</p>
                    <p>No. 8. Rev. Mr. Pierce is also at an end. Five of the robbers escaped for
                        want of identification on the trial. Two of them were convicted and
                        sentenced to hard labor in prison.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pettibone at my instance has kindly undertaken to write to Mr. <pb
                            n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0567"/>Pierce to know if he wants return
                        of the property taken from him; if so, to furnish me with an itemized
                        statement of it,</p>
                    <p>No. 7. Rev. Mr. Montgomery is the only case really remaining without
                        disposition. As to it, I am informed that the robbers have been arrested.
                        Through Mr. Pettibone, I have sent for a statement from Mr. Montgomery
                        himself as to the present status of the affair, including a statement of the
                        property taken from him, with its value, without which it is not possible to
                        make demand for compensation. When that comes to hand I shall present it
                        according to instructions.</p>
                    <p>Let me add that an examination of the records of the legation satisfies me,
                        not merely that my predecessors, including Mr. Heap, as chargé d’affaires,
                        are exonerated from the charge of indifference in connection with the
                        foregoing cases of outrage, but that they are entitled to the greatest
                        credit. Mr. Pettibone, in behalf of his brethren here, is about to write to
                        Mr. Clark, at Boston, to that effect.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that on the
                        16th instant I received from the Rev. R. M. Cole, an American missionary
                        resident at Erzroom, but temporarily visiting this city, a note stating that
                        on or about September 17 ultimo, Major Everett, British vice-consul at
                        Erzroom, had sent him a communication saying that from a circular then at
                        hand he was afraid he would not be able to look after American <pb n="496"
                            xml:id="pg_496" facs="0568"/>interests thereafter, and advising him (Mr.
                        C.) that he had better see the ambassador at Constantinople about the
                        matter. A copy of Mr. Cole’s letter is inclosed.</p>
                    <p>The evening of the 16th I called to see Lord Dufferin to ascertain if the
                        circular was of general application, and whether it was possible to obtain a
                        modification of it so as to allow Americans to have the benefit of the
                        protection theretofore generously accorded them in localities where there
                        was no American consul. His lordship explained that the circular had not
                        been issued from any indisposition to give needful security to my
                        countrymen, especially American missionaries, but was really to enable Her
                        Majesty’s consuls to prevent the abuse of the privilege by unworthy
                        characters. He suggested that if I would address him a note of request in
                        behalf of Americans, it would give him pleasure to submit it to the proper
                        home authorities, and he had no doubt it would receive favorable
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>Following this suggestion, next day I addressed a note to his lordship, of
                        which a copy is inclosed.</p>
                    <p>A copy of his lordship’s reply is also made an inclosure herewith, together
                        with the circular referred to in his note.</p>
                    <p>I have little doubt that Her Majesty’s authorities will kindly permit the
                        modification requested. In the event they do not, however, it will be matter
                        of serious concern by the President and his advisers to remedy speedily as
                        possible the situation in which our people in the distant parts of the
                        empire and elsewhere unfortunately find themselves. Indeed, I submit the
                        propriety of some action looking to protecting them independently of English
                        courtesy.</p>

                            statement:</p>
                        <p>We, like other American missionaries of Armenia, have hitherto received
                            the kind consideration of English consuls so far as to secure all needed
                            personal protection, the same as British subjects. But on or about
                            September 17 I received a communication from Major Everett, Her British
                            Majesty’s vice-consul at Erzroom, reading something as follows:</p>
                        <p>“I am sorry to say that from a circular just at hand, I am afraid I shall
                            not be able to look after American interests in the future. You had
                            better see the ambassador at Constantinople about it,” &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now I beg to submit to your excellency as to whether such a decision has
                            been come to by Her Majesty’s Government, or may we not yet hope that
                            the former courtesy will be extended to us, especially as in those
                            interior towns it will be very difficult to arrange suitable consular
                            agencies.</p>

                            elsewhere in the East, have been recipients of the very efficient
                            protection heretofore extended them in times of danger by Her Majesty’s
                            consuls, and in behalf of my government to make grateful acknowledgments
                                <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0569"/>for all such favors. The

                            sufficiency of that protection and the certainty of its being given them
                            on proper appeal, is so well known to your lordship that you can imagine
                            with what consternation notice was received from your vice-consul, Major
                            Everett, at Erzroom, to the effect that it would not be longer in his
                            power to look after their interests.</p>
                        <p>Moved by great solicitude for the good people left thus exposed, I make
                            haste to inquire if it would be inconsistent with your lordship’s views
                            or the policy of Her Majesty’s Government to so modify the instructions
                            issued to your consular authorities in Turkey, and elsewhere in the
                            province of your embassy, as to permit of the ancient protection as
                            respects my countrymen. If compliance with my request should be found
                            possible, will your lordship permit me to hope for speedy action in the
                            matter?</p>

                            will perceive that British consular protection cannot be afforded to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The question of granting British consular
                            protection to persons who are not British subjects, or who are not
                            actually in the service of British consular officers, has recently been
                            brought to the notice of Earl Granville.</p>
                        <p>It appears to his lordship that even as regards foreigners acually in the
                            service of Her Majesty’s consulates, protection should only be extended
                            to a limited number, but that, as regards any other foreigner who may
                            claim it, nothing short of the most special circumstances would warrant
                            the grant of protection, unless the government of the country of which
                            the foreigner applying for protection is a native shall have previously
                            requested and obtained the consent of Her Majesty’s Government to such
                            protection being accorded, on the ground that the applicant has no
                            consular authority representing his own country in the locality to whom
                            he can appeal.</p>
                        <p>I have, therefore, to request that, in dealing with applications from
                            foreigners for protection, you will act in accordance with the
                            principles laid down in this dispatch.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Adverting to the paragraph in the President’s
                        recent message to Congress touching the insecurity of life and property in
                        Turkey, I have now to transmit for your information a copy of a letter from
                        the secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
                        of the 13th ultimo, respecting the reported action of the Turkish Government
                        in rejecting the good offices of British consuls in the behalf of our
                        citizens.</p>
                    <p>Alluding to the uniform courtesy of diplomatic intercourse which permits
                        consuls of friendly powers to exert good offices in the interest of
                        strangers whose country maintains no consular representatives in regions
                        where such offices are be to availed of, I desire to observe that we are
                        naturally anxious to learn what channel of protection will be available for
                        our citizens in those regions, in view of the Turkish Government having
                        withdrawn its courteous recognition of British good offices in behalf of
                        Americans in places where we have no consular officers. The labors of
                        American missionaries in the domains of the Porte, and their exemplary
                        self-sacrificing devotion to the interests of suffering humanity of whatever
                        creed in times of pestilence and famine, entitle them, it is believed, to
                        the respect and gratitude of the Turkish Government and to the consideration
                        of our own government and people in a peculiar degree. This government has
                        been so often assured of the friendliness of the Porte in respect to our
                        citzens in Turkey that we cannot permit ourselves to doubt that it will
                        continue to be shown in this exigency.</p>
                    <p>You will accordingly bring this subject to the attention of the minister for
                        foreign affairs and report the result of your application to the Department
                        for its information.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Major Everett, the British
                            vice-consul at Erzroom, in Eastern Turkey, has notified the missionaries
                            of the American Board resident in Erzroom that an order has been issued
                            by the authorities, as I understand it, to the effect that British
                            consuls have no authority to interfere with the Turkish Government in
                            the protection of foreigners not British subjects. Hitherto Americans
                            resident in that part of Turkey have been protected and their interests
                            cared for by British consuls. The paper communicated to our missionaries
                            is as follows: “As regards any other foreigner who may claim it (British
                            protection), nothing short of the most special circumstances would
                            warrant <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0571"/>the grant of
                            protection, unless the government of the country of which the foreigner
                            applying for protection is a native shall have previously requested and
                            obtained the consent of Her Majesty’s Government to such protection
                            being accorded, on the ground that the applicant has no consular
                            authority representing his own country in the locality to whom he can
                            appeal.” The Turkish Government is aware of this order and is taking
                            advantage of it, to the very serious annoyance of our missionaries in
                            many ways I submit the case to the State Department. Will it be
                            practicable for the Department to place American citizens in those
                            portions of the Empire out of the reach of American consulates under the
                            the supervision of British officials for their protection, or will the
                            State Department appoint consuls or vice-consuls to act in its
                            behalf?</p>

                            dated November 17, 1881, communicated to the administration of the six
                            contributions by the ministry of foreign affairs, that the claim of
                            Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme is started from a misunderstanding and is
                            based on an erroneous interpretation of the new regulations relating to
                            alcohol used for the manufacture of mastic (rakki).</p>
                        <p>Article 14 of this regulation does not bear any attempt to the provisions
                            of article 5 of the treaty of commerce of the 13th (25th) of February,
                            1862. It has not in any <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0572"/>way in
                            view the alcohol which is not intended for the manufacture of mastic.
                            The alcohol as long as it is not transformed in mastic pays solely the
                            custom duties, remaining, however, under the formalities which permit
                            the administration to ascertain of its final use.</p>
                        <p>Article 14 has in view really the foreign alcohols intended for the
                            manufacture of mastic.</p>
                        <p>The taxes of the manufacture of mastic are in existence since an
                            immemorial time. Before the promulgation of the law of 1861, that tax
                            was of 20 per cent.; the law of 1861 reduced it to 10 per cent. An
                            imperial irade of the 18th of August, 1878, has increased that tax of
                            half as much for alcoholic drinks as for tobacco, and so brought them to
                            15 per cent. It is in virtue of that irade, confirmed on the 8th of
                            September, 1881, that the tax of 32 paras, mentioned in article 14 of
                            the new regulation, became 48 paras per oke.</p>
                        <p>The new regulation of July 22, 1881, instead of aggravating the situation
                            of the manufacturers who used to pay up to that time 60 paras per oke,
                            gives them the benefit of a notable reduction, viz, 12 paras per oke,
                                <hi rend="italic">provided that the alcohol intended to be turned
                                into mastic pays in advance, and on the moment of its importation,
                                the tax of manufacture</hi>. This facility of payment in advance has
                            been granted on the request of the manufacturers of Constantinople, who
                            were desirous to franchise, themselves from every formality and
                            inspection in the storing of their importations of alcohol, and were
                            demanding a reduction of tax.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme then had certainly the faculty of getting
                            their barrels of alcohol by simply paying the custom duties of 8 per
                            cent. and by submitting to the provisions imposed by the administration,
                            in order to be able to follow the goods as to collect the tax of 60
                            paras by whomsoever it shall be due, in case that alcohol should be
                            employed for the manufacture of mastic.</p>
                        <p>It is more than evident that the merchants who import alcohol for the
                            manufacture of mastic (and nearly all importations have that object in
                            view) have every interest to pay in advance the manufacturing tax, for
                            this very reason, that the manufacturers who finally bear the tax get
                            the benefit of 12 paras per oke. Anyhow, that payment in advance is not
                            indispensable.</p>
                        <p>Besides it would be well to add that the administration reimburses to
                            whomsoever the taxes already collected in advance on any quantity of
                            alcohol finally to other use than the manufacture of mastic, such as to
                            the use of apothecaries, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>As to the amount of 64 paras per oke, claimed by the direction at Smyrna,
                            and interpreted at the end of the aforesaid note, as a penalty inflicted
                            on Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme, it is far from having that character.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your communication of the 31st December, ultimo, in reply to
                            mine of the preceding 17th November, relative to the new regulations
                            touching the importation of American alcohols. A report upon the same
                            subject from the administration of the six contributions, considerately
                            inclosed for my more definite information, was also received.</p>
                        <p>While your excellency is pleased to declare the action of the custom
                            officers at Smyrna a mistake attributable to a wrong construction of
                            Article XIV of the new regulations, your note fails to inform me that
                            any corrective instructions have been sent to such officers. I am
                            constrained, consequently, to ask you to be good enough to favor me with
                            a copy of such instructions as have been sent to them. Only by such
                            means can I ascertain how far and in what manner the requests which I
                            had the honor to submit to you in my note of the 17th November have been
                            complied with.</p>

                        <p>As to the project disclosed on the report of the administration of the
                            six contributions, I am convinced that the assent of my government can
                            never be had to it under cover of a regulation to facilitate the
                            collection of a tax on mastic manufactured in Turkey. It is really a
                            scheme to facilitate the collection of a duty on alcohol in excess of 18
                            paras the oke. Indeed, excellency, to reduce the matter to the utmost
                            simplicity, you will excuse me for remarking that the abrogation of a
                            treaty provision like that which fixes the duty on American alcohol, and
                            which in such positive language protects both the importer of the
                            article and the purchaser from him against a duty in excess of the fixed
                            rate, to be acceptable to my government, must have some better ground
                            than the making business easy for distillers of rakki in
                            Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>Under present circumstances it will continue to be my duty to persist in
                            the protest and request addressed to you in my note of the 17th
                            November.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As pertinent to your dispatch, No. 32, January
                        7, ultimo, relative to the withdrawal of the protection our citizens have
                        habitually enjoyed from British consuls at places in the Ottoman Empire
                        where we had no representatives, I have the honor to inclose for your
                        consideration a copy of a communication received this morning from Lord
                        Dufferin, in which there will be found, I believe, a happy solution of the
                        trouble which it was your purpose to provide against. Accordingly, until I
                        hear from you further, I shall venture to delay addressing his excellency
                        the minister of foreign affairs upon the subject.</p>
                    <p>If you will permit the suggestion, I have taken pains to inform myself of the
                        views of leading missionaries resident here, and, without meaning any
                        reflection upon the good-will of the Turkish authorities in whatever part,
                        they are of opinion that British protection would be greatly preferred by
                        their brethren in the interior. They say it has always been generously
                        given; they are used to it, and have found it effective.</p>
                    <p>Your worthy correspondent, Mr. Clark, is mistaken in his idea that the
                        British circular of withdrawal of protection was moved by the Turks. Besides
                        the explanation of the objects of the circular given in Lord Dufferin’s note
                        as proceeding from Earl Granville, his lordship has assured me verbally that
                        there was no interference in the matter by the imperial authorities. This,
                        in justice to the latter, as well as to show that the right of the English
                        to give protection at their pleasure, is still unquestioned.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence alluded to by Lord Dufferin in his first paragraph will be
                        found in my dispatch to the Department, No. 45, dated December 20, 1881.</p>

                            did not contemplate the withdrawal from your countrymen of the benefits
                            they might derive from the good offices of Her Majesty’s consuls.
                            Further, in order to remove all misunderstanding on this subject, Earl
                            Granville has requested me to send fresh instructions to Her Majesty’s
                            consuls in the Ottoman Empire, to the effect that although by the
                            circular in question they were desired to discourage as much as possible
                            the granting of British protection to persons who were not British
                            subjects, they may still continue to extend their good offices to
                            foreign missionaries or religious communities in cases of unmerited
                            violence or oppression by the local authorities, provided that no
                            inconvenience has hitherto arisen from such action, and provided that
                            their protection is not carried further than if the case were that of a
                            British subject.</p>
                        <p>These instructions will accordingly authorize Her Majesty’s consuls to
                            continue to give such friendly assistance and support to American
                            citizens as they have been in the habit of giving in places where no
                            American consular authority resides.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor, &amp;c.,</p>

                        received from the Porte yesterday, from which it will appear that the
                        Ottoman authorities are disposed to insist upon a revision of the tariff
                        provisions of the treaty of 1862. The reference to the denouncement of the
                        treaty itself is in terms somewhat vague, but may be understood, I think, as
                        meaning that it is their desire that the revision of the present tariff
                        shall be effected with a view to a correspondence between its terms and
                        those of the treaty in prospect.</p>
                    <p>I will be happy to have your instructions touching the matter. Until they are
                        received, I shall do no more than acknowledge receipt of the note

                        <p>According to the language of the treaty of commerce concluded between
                            Turkey and the United States of America on the 25th of February, 1862,
                            each of the contracting parties has the right to demand the revision of
                            the tariff one year before the expiration of each period of seven
                            years.</p>
                        <p>This term, as respects the present period, expires on the 1–13 of this
                            month. The undersigned, minister of foreign affairs of His Imperial
                            Majesty the Sultan, has the honor to apprise the minister resident of
                            the United States of America that the Sublime Porte demands the revision
                            of the tariff at present in force.</p>
                        <p>As, however, the Sublime Porte has decided to denounce the treaty itself
                            at the expiration of the twenty-first year, it is understood that the
                            revision of the present tariff, which is an integral part of the treaty,
                            shall be made on the basis to be fixed hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned begs the minister resident of the United States to be
                            pleased to take notice of the preceding declaration, and takes this

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: In the correspondence relative to
                            certain new regulations touching the importation of alcohols which were
                            the subject of a protest from this legation, dated November 17, 1881,
                            you were pleased in one of your notes to declare the action of the
                            customs officials at Smyrna in that connection a mistake attributable to
                            a wrong construction of Article XIV of the regulations. Accepting the
                            admission as in good faith, and construing it as equivalent to a promise
                            on your excellency’s part that the mistake should be promptly corrected,
                            and the practice of the officials reformed, I permitted the matter to
                            pass out of mind. But now it is with regret that I have to inform you of
                            the receipt of information from Smyrna to the effect that collections
                            upon alcohol from the United States have there gone on under the
                            so-called new regulations without stop or abatement. Upon the
                            presumption that there must be a degree of respect for orders when
                            received by customs officers from the Porte, the inference is scarcely
                            to be avoided that no corrective instructions whatever were in this
                            instance sent to Smyrna; much less were the officials at that place
                            directed to return to collections upon alcohol from the United States
                            within the terms of the treaty, as I had the honor to demand. Should
                            this inference be correct, the failure is certainly liable to be
                            received by my superiors in Washington as an omission hardly
                            distinguishable from an act of unfriendliness which your admission above
                            referred to will tend to make the more pointed.</p>
                        <p>In confidence that your excellency does not wish such an impression to go
                            abroad, I beg to serve you with an opportunity to demonstrate your good
                            intent, as well as your respect for existing treaties, by renewing the
                            demand made upon you in my note of November 17, above mentioned, that
                            the direction of indirect contributions at Smyrna be required to suspend
                            the further execution of the said article 14 in so far as it has effect
                            upon any article of production or manufacture in the United States of
                            America imported into the empire and possessions of His Imperial Majesty
                            the Sultan; that as respects every article the produce or manufacture of
                            the United States, whether in the hands of a buyer or seller in His
                            Majesty’s Empire, the said article 14 be canceled and revoked; and in
                            particular that the duty upon alcohol from the United States be returned
                            and limited to the rate of 16 paras the oke, as fixed by the agreed
                            tariff under the treaty. And that the customs officers at Smyrna may be
                            left without excuse for further persistence in their unlawful
                            collections, as well as that the American consul at that city may have
                            information needful for the protection of the very important interest in
                            question, your excellency will permit me to further demand a copy of the
                            instructions which you may be pleased to issue to the said officials. I
                            consider it proper to notify you also that in a few days I will present
                            to you a statement showing the total amount of duty paid at Smyrna under
                            the so-called new regulations on imported American alcohol, and demand
                            payment of the charges in excess of the duty agreed upon under the
                            treaty. Your excellency will oblige me by an early reply to this
                            communication.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the matter of collection of excessive
                        duties upon American alcohols in the port of Smyrna, I am constrained to
                        notify you again that there is little, if any, hope of bringing the Porte to
                        an observance of our treaty rights.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Duncan, United States consul at Smyrna, informed me by note received last
                        Sunday that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Mr. Alexander Sidi, an American, and perhaps the largest merchant
                                here of any nationality, expects next week a cargo of 2,100 barrels
                                of alcohol from Lanman &amp; Kemp, one of the leading New York
                                exporters, to be followed soon by other similar cargoes. The
                                difference in duty between 8 per cent. as authorized by our treaty
                                and the 32 per cent. imposed will amount on this cargo alone to
                                between 2,000 and 3,000 Turkish pounds.</p>
                            <p>He will make the first payment under protest, as I advise him,
                                reclaiming the difference. But can nothing be done to compel the
                                Turkish Government to respect our treaty while it remains
                                unchanged?</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Already three notes of protest upon this subject, as strenuous in terms as
                        regard for courtesy would permit, had been addressed to the Porte from the
                        legation, the first one dated November 17, 1881; the second, January 11,
                        1882; the third, March 18, 1882. Copies of these protests were immediately
                        inclosed to the Department.</p>
                    <p>On the 31st December, the minister of foreign affairs, Assim Pasha, replied
                        to my note of November 17, declaring the action of the customs <pb n="506"
                            xml:id="pg_506" facs="0578"/>officers at Smyrna a mistake attributable
                        to a wrong construction of a certain article of the new regulations which
                        were the subject of protest.</p>
                    <p>The other notes have not as yet been answered in writing.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Upon receipt of the information quoted from Consul Duncan’s letter, I called
                        to see his excellency the minister, hoping he might by this time be able to
                        give me some satisfaction about the business. The visit was on last Tuesday.
                        As an introduction, I told him that an American was sending a large cargo of
                        alcohol to Smyrna, and that it would arrive this or next week, making it a
                        matter of renewed importance that the Article XIV of the new regulations
                        should be canceled, and that the order to that effect should be sent to
                        Smyrna immediately. I requested to know if any action had been taken by the
                        Porte in the matter. He admitted no action had been taken. I reminded him he
                        had admitted in a note to me that the customs officials at Smyrna were under
                        a mistake as to the interpretation of the new regulations sent to them. To
                        that he replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Well, if we recall the regulations, we have no means left to prevent
                                smuggling and the evasion of the tax upon mastic. I think you might
                                lend us that much help.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I told him there was no room to doubt the willingness of my government to
                        lend aid to His Majesty in every way proper, but it could not do so to the
                        sacrifice of the right of its own citizens; that it would be unreasonable if
                        my government consented to stand by and permit another government to take
                        large sums of money out of the pocket of Americans who were claiming its
                        protection.</p>
                    <p>I reminded him of his failure to answer my objections, both verbal and
                        written; that the last time I spoke to him on the subject, he suggested that
                        I go and see the chief of the customs bureau and speak to him; that upon my
                        objecting to such a course as out of the rule, he had agreed himself to send
                        for that official and get information as to how the question stood. I asked
                        if he had done so. Upon his replying that he had not had time, I told him
                        that by my direction Mr. Gargiulo had called upon that official and received
                        from him the reply that nothing had been ordered to be done in the business,
                        and that he could do nothing without an order from the Porte. I told the
                        minister further * * * that I had come to know of him what was meant to be
                        done; that the only question in the case was the rightfulness of the
                        collection of 48 paras per oke in addition to the 16 paras allowed by the
                        treaty; that he had admitted it was in excess of the provisions of the
                        treaty; that our right and his duty were equally plain. He then said the
                        question was a specialty; that he was not sufficiently advised of it to make
                        an argument with me; but that he wished to inform himself about it, and for
                        that purpose he suggested that I consent to let Mr. Gargiulo meet a Mr.
                        Bertram, one of the chief customs officers here, and talk the business over
                        before him. I asked him when the interview should take place. He said on
                        Thursday (yesterday). I remarked that it was the policy of continuance over
                        again, but that it would not be right for me to refuse. With that I adverted
                        to another subject, and shortly after came away.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, at the hour specified, Mr. Gargiulo went to the Porte and met not
                        Mr. Bertram merely, but two other officials, one of them a lawyer of the
                        department.</p>
                    <p>Instead of canvassing the subject then in presence of the minister, the party
                        were sent into a room by themselves. * * *</p>
                    <p>The officials representing the minister did not know what they were <pb
                            n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0579"/>there for, and Mr. Gargiulo had to
                        tell them. They insisted upon the proposition that without such a regulation
                        as the one we objected to the government would not be able to prevent
                        smuggling and collect the excise tax upon mastic. Mr. G. answered that the
                        question had reference to the treaty, and he was there to speak of that
                        alone. To be brief, nothing came of the interview except an admission from
                        the lawyer that the treaty was plain, and that the new regulation was not
                        less plainly in violation of it, and that the Turks knew it. In the midst of
                        the talk a messenger appeared and called Mr. Bertram to go to the palace. It
                        was agreed before separation that the party should hold another meeting next
                        Monday.</p>
                    <p>I have it in mind with respect to the next meeting to direct Mr. Gargiulo to
                        attend it as per appointment, but to inform the gentlemen, that he must

                        he is a naturalized or native born citizen, and if the former, where and
                        when did he obtain his papers; the originals or a certified copy thereof he
                        should transmit hither. This request is not made to question the correctness
                        of Mr. Consul Duncan’s statement that Mr. Sidi is an American, but merely
                        that the Department may be fully advised before giving yon positive

                        of 3d June containing a sweeping interdiction against salted meats from
                        America, including lards. There is not much direct importation of the
                        prohibited articles; wherefore, besides that reflection, there is
                        consolation in the facts that nearly, if not quite, nine-tenths of the
                        salted meats consumed in Turkey will continue to be the American product
                        under some foreign brand, and that whether first marketed in France,
                        England, or Germany, the original dealer is not likely to be deprived of his
                        profits by proclamations such as is here inclosed and translated.</p>

                            note verbal from the Sublime Porte, dated June 3 instant, in which you
                            have been pleased to inform me that the measure of interdiction against
                            the introduction of salted meats from America is extended to hams and
                            lard, regardless of the form of their importation into Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will pardon an expression of surprise at the action thus
                            indicated, announced, as it is, without a reason given. If reference is
                            had to the treaty between the powers, it appears to me arbitrary in the
                            highest degree. While it continues in its present form it cannot but be
                            construed as a discrimination against an important article of American
                            manufacture, and peculiarly in violation of treaty rights, for which
                            reasons it is my duty to earnestly protest against its execution. At the
                            same time to open a way to an accommodation of the points presented, I
                            will esteem it a favor if you will give me the reasons which have
                            induced the Porte to resolve upon the interdiction, and give them to me
                            before execution of the measure is entered upon. Not impossibly the
                            operative causes may be explained away.</p>

                        petroleum. If carried into operation the result will be to burden the

                    <p>In protesting against the proposed measure, I availed myself of the
                        opportunity to group with it the other infringements of American rights now
                        in question between the governments, viz, the extra charges upon alcohol and
                        the prohibition of salted meats, and to submit to the new minister a summary
                        of the privileges, in my opinion, clearly deducible from article 5 of the
                        treaty of 1862.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The undersigned, Alexander Sidi, a citizen
                            of the United States of America, has the honor to state as follows:</p>
                        <p>In the month of July, of the year 1873, the local authorities being
                            justly preoccupied of the danger existing in the storage of a large
                            quantity of petroleum in the store-houses of the city, desired to remedy
                            this practice by submitting this sort of business to a special
                            regulation. His excellency Vely Pasha, then governor-general of the
                            vilayet of Aidin, has assembled at the Corak to that effect MM. all the
                            consuls of the foreign powers, and the regulation, which you must have
                            seen, has been published with the approval of the Idaré Medjiliss of
                            this vilayet.</p>
                        <p>It results from this regulation: <list>
                                <label>1st.</label>
                                <item>That the merchants dealing in petroleum must have a
                                    store-house for this article at two kilometers distance from the
                                    town of their choice.</item>
                                <label>2d.</label>
                                <item>That the local authorities reserve for itself the right of
                                    controlling the daily importation of petroleum into the town,
                                    that this quantity should not exceed the daily want of
                                    consumption.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The undersigned, who is engaged in the petroleum business in this town,
                            has been obliged, therefore, in order to comply with the regulations in
                            force, to hire store-houses in Holka Bonner.</p>
                        <p>The said regulation on the commerce of petroleum exists since 1873. It is
                            therefore in force in Smyrna since nine years, and from the fact that
                            during all this time it has not given rise to any complaint it is
                            evident that the formalities resolved upon gave satisfaction to all
                            interests concerned in the question.</p>
                        <p>I am informed, however, that the regulation now existing, so just and so
                            equitable, is on the point of being modified so as to injure the
                            interests of commerce and commit the security of the town.</p>
                        <p>The Idaré Medjiliss of Smyrna is disposed to grant to a firm from
                            Constantinople the privilege of establishing a single and unique
                            store-house, for petroleum in Smyrna, forcing thus the merchants to
                            abandon their own store-rooms, established in conformity with the
                            provisions of the regulations of 1873.</p>
                        <p>The grantee of the new store-house for petroleum would collect a tax of
                            about 8 percent., making a return of 1 per cent, to the municipality of
                            Smyrna, and the merchants would be obliged to pay this tax of about 8
                            per cent. when these same expenses at present in the stores of the
                            undersigned amount scarcely to 2 per cent.</p>
                        <p>Should the above-mentioned decision of the Idaré Medjiliss be put into
                            execution the undersigned is convinced that not only it will be contrary
                            to equity and to the treaties of commerce now in force between the
                            Sublime Porte and the foreign powers, but that it will also constitute a
                            danger for public security. It is contrary to equity, as the undersigned
                            being forced to take the measures in accordance with the regulation of
                            1873, he cannot abandon them and make use of foreign store-houses,
                            incurring tax four times superior to his present expenses.</p>
                        <p>It is contrary to the treaties of commerce, which reject all other tax
                            except that of the custom-house duty of 8 per cent. on the merchandise
                            imported.</p>
                        <p>It is contrary to commerce, which will not be able to insure its
                            petroleum against the risks of fire, the good insurance companies
                            refusing unlimited risks on petroleum which would be concentrated in a
                            single store-house.</p>
                        <p>Besides, the commerce of petroleum in our city, burdened with new taxes,
                            will see its customers from the islands and towns of the sea-coast
                            supply themselves from the places of Syra and Piraeus, where they will
                            be able to procure this article in transit with better conditions than
                            in Smyrna, and commerce would be thus deprived of his important outlet
                            to the advantage of the places in Greece.</p>
                        <p>It is contrary to public security, because the fire of a unique
                            store-house would constitute a much greater danger than the fire of
                            private store-houses, dispersed at different points, and always at two
                            kilometers from the town.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, as much in the interest of the town of Smyrna, in
                            general, as in that of the merchants who obey the regulations prescribed
                            with a view to public security that the undersigned protests against the
                            decision taken by the Idaré Medjiliss of this vilayet to establish a
                            single and unique store-house for petroleum at Smyrna, to the prejudice
                            of the merchants dealing in the commerce of this article.</p>
                        <p>They beg you, Mr. Consul, to be so kind as to take their just demands
                            into consideration, and to grant them the support of your efficient
                            intervention.</p>

                                the commerce of petroleum, and the rejection of the decision of the

                            Co., merchants, established and residing in Smyrna, have the honor in
                            our quality of representatives in this city of MM. Iasigi &amp; Co.,
                            American merchants, established and residing in Boston, No. 30 Kilby
                            street, by virtue of a regular procuration to bring to your notice, very
                            respectfully, that the Ottoman Government intends to burden the
                            importation of petroleum into Smyrna with a supplementary tax of 8 per
                            cent. which is disguised under the name of warehouse duty,
                            independently, of course, of the custom-house duty equally of 8 per
                            cent.</p>
                        <p>In fact the authorities of Constantinople, on the recommendation of Idaré
                            Medjiliss of our city, would be on the point of granting to a private
                            individual the privilege or monoply to hold a unique store-house, where
                            all the merchants of our city would be forced to deposit petroleum and
                            to pay a tax of 8 per cent.</p>
                        <p>Conforming ourselves, therefore, with the provisions of the III article
                            reproduce below, of the regulation of 13th (25th) October, 1873, made by
                            the local authorities with the assistance and adoption of the consular
                            body of this city, we have constructed since that time large stone built
                            warehouses ad hoc, where we deposited the petroleum which our
                            above-mentioned principals send us.</p>
                        <p>During the long period of nine years no misfortune has taken place, even
                            the least accident, to authorize or excuse the modification of the
                            regulation now in force. On the contrary, the dispositions being
                            practical and wise and in conformity with the spirit of the general
                            regulation of the month of December, 1874, concerning the commerce of
                            petroleum, have, besides, the advantage of conciliating at the same time
                            the public and private interests, and specially not to injure the spirit
                            or the letter of the capitulations and of the international treaties of
                            commerce, according to the terms of which nobody in Turkey has the right
                            to collect under any title or any pretext whatever another duty, except
                            the unique custom-house duty of 8 per cent.</p>
                        <p>To oblige us to part against our will with our petroleum in order to
                            intrust it to the guard of an individual or his employés, whoever they
                            may be, to force the merchants to any and supplementary tax by obliging
                            us to pay, under a special title or the pretext of warehousing, a tax of
                            8 per cent., when our expenses in relation thereto scarcely amount at
                            the most to 1½ per cent., this is according to us a violation of the
                            spirit and the letter of the capitulations and treaties of commerce
                            existing between the foreign powers and the Sublime Porte.</p>
                        <p>It is for the safeguard of the rights and interests of our
                            above-mentioned employers that we take respectfully the liberty, in this
                            quality, to address to you these presents in order to beg you to be so
                            kind as to submit them urgently to his excellency the minister of the
                            United States of America at Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>Being confident in his constant solicitude for the defense and the
                            protection of the rights and legitimate interests of his
                            fellow-citizens, we are sure that he will kindly think promptly of such
                            measures as this grave and prejudicial state of things will suggest to
                            him in order to stop the realization thereof, protesting especially, in
                            the most formal and energetic manner, against any payment of a
                            supplementary tax under any pretext and any title whatever, it maybe,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The undersigned, Reggio &amp; Belhomme,
                            agents of MM. Laforme &amp; Frothingham, of Boston, Mass., citizens of
                            the United States of America, have the honor to state as follows:</p>
                        <p>In the month of July, of the year 1870, the local authorities considering
                            justly the danger existing in the storage of a large quantity of
                            petroleum in the warehouses of the town, desired to remedy this practice
                            by submitting this sort of business to a special regulation. His
                            excellency Vely Pasha, then governor-general of the vilayet of Aidin,
                            has assembled at his corak, to that effect MM, the consuls of foreign
                            powers and the regulation, copy of which is inclosed, has been published
                            with the approval of Idaré Medjiliss of this vilayet.</p>
                        <p>It results from this regulation: <list>
                                <item>First. That the merchants engaged in the petroleum business
                                    must have a storeroom of their choice, for this merchandise, at
                                    two kilometers distance from the town.</item>
                                <item>Second. That the local authority reserves for itself the right
                                    of controlling the daily importation of petroleum into the town,
                                    that this quantity should not exceed the daily want of
                                    consumption.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The undersigned, who are engaged in the petroleum business in this town,
                            have been obliged therefore, in order to comply with the regulation in
                            force, to have stores constructed immediately on the coast of Cordelio
                            for their account and for that of MM. Laforme &amp; Frothingham, of
                            Boston, the cost of which amounts to 100,000 francs.</p>
                        <p>The said regulation on the commerce of petroleum exists since 1873. It
                            has, therefore, been in force in Smyrna during nine years, and by the
                            fact that it has not given rise to any complaint during all this time,
                            it is evident that the formalities resolved upon gave satisfaction to
                            all interests concerned in this question.</p>
                        <p>We are, however, informed the regulation now existing, so just and so
                            equitable, is on the point of being modified in such a manner as to
                            injure the interests of commerce and commit the security of the town.
                            The Idaré Medjiliss of Smyrna is disposed to grant to a firm of
                            Constantinople, the privilege of establishing a sole and unique
                            store-house of petroleum in Smyrna, and oblige in this way the merchants
                            to abandon their own store-rooms which were established in conformity
                            with the requirements of the regulation of 1873. The grantee of the new
                            store house would collect a tax of about 8 per cent, making a return of
                            1 per cent, to the municipality of Smyrna, and the merchants should be
                            obliged to pay this tax of about 8 per cent. when actually these same
                            expenses amount only to 1 or 1½ per cent.</p>
                        <p>Should the above-mentioned decision of the Idaré Medjiliss be put in
                            force, the undersigned are convinced that not only it will be contrary
                            to equity and to the existing treaties of commerce between the Sublime
                            Porte and the foreign powers, but that it will also constitute a danger
                            for public security.</p>
                        <p>It is contrary to equity, because the undersigned being obliged by the
                            regulation of 1873 to construct store-houses for petroleum for their own
                            usage, costing them 100,000 francs, cannot abandon them and make use of
                            foreign store-houses incurring a tax eight times superior to their
                            present expenses.</p>
                        <p>It is contrary to the treaties of commerce, which reject all other tax
                            except that of the customs duty of 8 per cent, on goods imported. It is
                            contrary to commerce, which will be unable to insure always its
                            petroleum against the risks of fire, the good insurance companies
                            refusing unlimited risks on petroleum which would be concentrated in a
                            single store-house.</p>
                        <p>Besides, the petroleum business of our time burdened with new taxes, will
                            see its customers from the islands and the towns of the sea-coast to
                            supply themselves from the places of Syra and Piraeus, where it will be
                            able to procure this article in transit with better conditions than in
                            Smyrna, and business would be thus deprived of this important outlet to
                            the advantage of the places of Greece.</p>
                        <p>It is contrary to public security, as the fire of a unique store-house
                            would constitute a much greater danger than the fire of private
                            store-rooms dispersed at different points and at two kilometers’
                            distance from the town.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, as much in the interest of the town of Smyrna in
                            general, as in that of the honest merchants who obey the regulations
                            resolved upon with a view to public security, that the undersigned
                            protest against the decision arrived at by the Idaré Medjiliss of this
                            vilayet, to establish a single and sole store-house of petroleum in
                            Smyrna to the detriment of the merchants dealing in this article.</p>
                        <p>They beg you, Mr. Consul, to be so kind as to take their just complaint
                            into consideration, and to grant them the support of your efficient
                            intervention.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First. Near his excellency Ali Pasha, governor-general of the
                                vilayet of Aidin, for the maintenance of the regulation promulgated
                                in 1873 on the commerce of petroleum, and the rejection of the
                                decision of the Idaré Medjiliss.</item>

                                in order that the government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan
                                should refuse such a concession to a private individual to the
                                detriment of commerce and of the public security of this
                                city.</item>

                            undersigned beg you, Mr. Consul, to be so kind as to accept the
                            acknowledgment of their profoundest respect, with which they have the

                        <p>Considering the proceedings of deliberation taken by his excellency Vely
                            Pasha, governor-general of the vilayet of Aidin and MM. the foreign
                            consuls residing at Smyrna the 29th June–11th July, 1870, from which it
                            results that the store-house of a large quantity of petroleum in the
                            town of Smyrna constitutes an imminent danger for the city, and that it
                            is urgent to think about the means for making this danger disappear:</p>
                        <p>That it was necessary to remove immediately from the town the petroleum
                            existing therein, and forbid the direct introduction of any other
                            petroleum which may arrive in future;</p>
                        <p>That it was necessary, in order to obviate the above-mentioned
                            inconveniences, to store all petroleum arriving in future at Smyrna in a
                            remote place from the town:</p>
                        <p>A commission has been charged then to find a convenient place for the
                            storage of petroleum; but this mission having, unfortunately, remained
                            without execution on account of the difficulties that the choice of such
                            a locality presented conciliating the interests of the different
                            importers, and his excellency Sureya Pasha, being justly preoccupied of
                            this state of things which was prolonged until now, and considering the
                            urgency, after having consulted with the council of the administration
                            of the vilayet, has resolved and resolves the following:</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article First.</hi></p>
                        <p>Every vessel arriving in the harbor of Smyrna loaded with petroleum must
                            anchor outside of the other vessels which are anchored about the harbor,
                            and stop at the place which will be indicated to it by the
                            harbor-master.</p>

                        <p>As soon as the vessel shall be at anchor in this way it will receive on
                            board an officer of the municipality, who will remain on board until the
                            complete discharge of the petroleum. The salary of the said guard, fixed
                            at nine piastres (two francs) a day, is to the charge of the captain of
                            the vessel.</p>

                        <p>All the petroleum found in the vessel shall be landed in a special

                            store-house should be distant two kilometers at least from the town and
                            one kilometer at the minimum from the village.</p>
                        <p>It is allowed, however, to transship all or a portion of the cargo of
                            petroleum on board another vessel for exportation. The vessel in which
                            the petroleum would be transshipped shall be subject to the
                            precautionary measures established in Article 1, as long as it shall
                            remain in the harbor of Smyrna.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article Fourth.</hi></p>
                        <p>The vessel loaded with petroleum shall not be allowed to change the
                            anchorage which was assigned to it by the harbor-master until the full
                            discharge of the petroleum.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article Fifth.</hi></p>

                            stores.</p>
                        <p>The approximate consumption of petroleum in the town of Smyrna being
                            about a thousand cases (25,000 okes) per week, it is not allowed to keep
                            a greater quantity at a time in town. And until a distribution of this

                        <p>Every retail dealer in petroleum authorized by law shall be furnished

                            must exchange his permit with another, which shall be delivered to him
                            for his newly-situated shop.</p>

                            communication which I think it well to make to the end that a better
                            understanding may be had of the commercial rights asserted for citizens
                            of the United States of America, I respectfully invite your attention to
                            the following quotations taken from Article V of the treaty of commerce
                            between our respective governments of 1862:</p>
                        <p>“His Imperial Majesty further engages that, save as hereinafter excepted,
                            he will not prohibit the importation into his dominions and possessions
                            of any article the produce and manufacture of the United States of
                            America, from whatever place arriving, and that the duties to be imposed
                            on every article the produce or manufacture of the United States of
                            America imported into the empire and possessions of His Imperial Majesty
                            the Sultan shall in no case exceed one fixed rate of 8 per cent. ad
                            valorem, or a specific duty, fixed by common consent, equivalent
                            thereto. * * * *. If these articles, after having paid the import duty
                            of 8 per cent., are sold either at the place of their arrival or in the
                            interior of the country, neither the buyer nor the seller shall be
                            charged with any further duty in respect to them,” &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>A reading of the text quoted discloses four points which would seem to be
                            impossible of contradiction or evasion: <list>

                                    from whatever place arriving, except tobacco and salt, they
                                    being the exceptions reserved in Article XIV of the

                                    one fixed rate of 8 per cent, ad valorem, or a specific duty,
                                    fixed by common consent, equivalent thereto.</item>

                                <item>The engagements so defined, in the nature of guarantys by His
                                    Imperial Majesty, have relation to the articles imported, not
                                    the citizenship or nationality of the person importing them.
                                    Enough always that the articles are the produce or manufacture
                                    of the United States of America.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>These deductions, I beg to say, are not presented to your excellency
                            because it is thought they are unknown to you, but to bring more clearly
                            to your view the matters of complaint subjoined.</p>
                        <p>The note verbal from the Sublime Porte, No. 25, dated June 3, 1882,
                            contains an interdiction absolute, and without pretense of
                            justification, against the importation of salted meats of American
                            manufacture. How, excellency, does that interdiction comport with the
                            engagement of His Majesty first above given?</p>
                        <p>Then there are the new regulations under which your customs officers in
                            Smyrna are collecting upon American alcohol, not 16 paras the oke, that
                            being the amount specifically agreed upon as the equivalent of 8 per
                            cent., but forty-eight paras the oke, the conditions being such that it
                            is possible to carry the levy to ——, and even —— paras.</p>
                        <p>How, permit me to ask, do such regulations agree with the provision of
                            the treaty second above given?</p>
                        <p>This, it must be added, has been going on against protest, and with the
                            knowledge of the Sublime Porte, for quite —— months; your predecessor
                            once declared the exaction a mistake on the part of the customs
                            officers; yet, though repeatedly be sought to correct it, he did
                            nothing. The unlawful collection is still going on. And now I am called
                            upon to present you another measure proposed of the same character
                            relating to petroleum, an item, as your excellency knows, of vast
                            consumption in Turkey, and almost exclusively an American product. In
                            1870 the practice of petrolem dealears in Smyrna was to store their
                            stocks on hand in the city. His excellency, the then governor-general of
                            the vilayet of Aidin, discerning the danger from fire incident to the
                            usage, required the merchants to provide themselves with houses for
                            safer keeping outside the city limits at least two kilometers. This was
                            done with consent of dealers, foreign consuls, and the Idaré Medjiliss,
                            and upon compliance by the dealers became a contract, they on one part,
                            the government on the other. Since 1873 the regulation has subsisted
                            satisfactorily to all concerned. It would appear, however, that the
                            present Idaré Medjiliss has other views. That body had decided to grant
                            to a person or firm the privilege of establishing a general storehouse
                            for petroleum in the city, and require merchants and dealers in the
                            article to give up storage in the houses prepared by them under the
                            regulation of 1873, and resort to the new one. No option is to be
                            allowed. In a tax or charge for storage of 8 per cent, the enterprising
                            grantees of the privilege are to find a profit of 7 per cent. and the
                            Idaré Medjiliss 1 per cent. The same scheme, I am informed, is to be set
                            at work in Constantinople, and probably in the empire generally. The
                            effect will be to exactly double the rate of charge permitted by the
                            treaty. With His Majesty’s engagements in view, how, excellency, can the
                            Sublime Porte permit a thing so plainly unlawful to go into
                            execution?</p>
                        <p>In protesting against the three measures referred to, it may serve well
                            to remark that I have grouped them together that your excellency may the
                            better perceive the unpleasant suspicions to which their further
                            continuance will certainly lead. A very singular-coincidence indeed,
                            that interdictions and oppressive duties should be the order of the day
                            against articles so necessary, some to His Majesty’s subjects, others to
                            foreigners resident in His Majesty’s dominions, and at the same time of
                            chief supply from America! Whether the hostility proceeds from the
                            Sublime Porte or at the instance of competitors in trade, the effects
                            upon American industries and rights are the same. My government is bound
                            to notice them.</p>
                        <p>I avail myself, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Through Mr. L. Oliphant I had an account of the Jewish exodus from Russia,
                        and of the misery the refugees were undergoing in the towns north of this.
                        Some of them having reached Constantinople, were starving in the streets. My
                        sympathy was naturally excited in their behalf.</p>
                    <p>On the 6th of June last two gentlemen were brought to the legation, and upon
                        introduction presented a paper, of which a copy is inclosed. You will
                        perceive that it is a petition craving assistance for their coreligionists
                        in the Kingdom of Roumania; that the subscribers represent themselves as
                        delegates acting for forty-nine local committees in their country; and that
                        the point they wished to gain, through my services unofficially rendered,
                        was the privilege of colonizing in such districts of Syria as contained
                        localities available for the purpose. They seemed respectable men and very
                        much in earnest. Mr. Oliphant was personally acqainted with them, and he
                        recommended them to be what they seemed. The interview resulted in my
                        telegraphing for permission to give them and their people my good offices in
                        obtaining for them, if possible, permission to colonize themselves in
                        Turkey.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Oliphant and a Mr. Alexander, both respectable gentlemen, were the agents
                        of the movement in Constantinople. They met me, by my invitation, at the
                        legation. A discussion of the best mode of procedure was had, and an
                        agreement reached. I was to visit the Porte and use <pb n="517"
                            xml:id="pg_517" facs="0589"/>my best efforts to get the privilege
                        sought; having obtained it, my connection with the business was to end; they
                        were to manage the immigration and the settlement of the colonists.</p>
                    <p>Agreeably to this arrangement, I visited the minister of foreign affairs, who
                        informed me that the matter had been before His Majesty’s council of
                        ministers, which had decided affirmatively that the Jews from whatever parts
                        could come and settle in Turkey; that there was a general law of immigration
                        in force which must be taken for the guidance of such as chose to come; that
                        they could come when they pleased, and would be settled in groups of two
                        hundred or two hundred and fifty families, that they could settle on any
                        unoccupied lands in Mesopotamia, about Aleppo, or in the regions of the
                        Orontes River; that they could not establish themselves in Palestine; that
                        the firman of the Sultan was unnecessary, for, having once approved the law,
                        he could not be called on to do so again; that every colonist was simply
                        bound to become an Ottoman subject.</p>
                    <p>This, you will readily see, covered all my part of the business. The refugees
                        could come immediately; the lands at their service were good; the law was
                        liberal and encouraging; if they behaved themselves they would do well. I
                        made report to Messrs. Oliphant and Alexander and discharged myself from the
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>A little later, when the affair had an appearance of taking on extraordinary
                        proportions, possibilities of trouble to the immigrants presented
                        themselves, and I thought it safer to have the worthy minister of foreign
                        affairs put his replies to me in writing. With that view, I addressed him a
                        note, of which a copy is inclosed. In an interview, the undersecretary (Mr.
                        Artin Effendi) assured me that as the immigration would be under the law, no
                        further assurances were necessary; and as that seemed reasonable, I was
                        satisfied, and did not press an answer to my communication. I make an
                        inclosure of the note because it sets out the minister’s replies on nearer
                        approach to exactitude.</p>
                    <p>For your more perfect understanding of the scheme as it now stands, and to
                        enable you to answer questions upon the subject, should such be addressed to
                        you, I take the liberty of making an inclosure of a copy of the Turkish law
                        of immigration (translated).</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, there is nothing to prevent all the Israelites on the earth
                        from settling in Asiatic Turkey. They shall not settle in Palestine—that is
                        the only prohibition.</p>

                            of the central committee of Jewish emigration in Roumania, representing
                            forty-nine local committees, beg to approach your excellency for the
                            purpose of craving your assistance and support in behalf of our
                            oppressed coreligionists who are suffering under legal disabilities in
                            the kingdom of Roumania, which render it impossible for them any longer
                            to find means of subsistence in that country, where many thousands are
                            reduced to starvation.</p>
                        <p>Sufficient funds have been subscribed by the Jewish committees in
                            Roumania to enable many colonies to be formed in the dominions of His
                            Majesty, and we would crave your excellency kindly to procure permission
                            and liberty for our coreligionists to settle in any of the
                            Mutessarafliks of Syria wherever there are available localities.</p>
                        <p>The points which we desire to know are, viz: Whether Jews on becoming
                            Turkish subjects will be permitted to settle in the waste lands of the
                            Vilayet of Syria, excluding <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0590"/>the
                            Pashalik of Palestine free of charge in groups of not more than five
                            hundred families, and whether they will also be permitted to purchase
                            lands and settle on them in agricultural communities.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>2d. Whether, if so, they will be exempt from taxation for the next
                                five years.</item>
                            <item>3d. Whether they will be permitted to construct roads to the
                                nearest large town or seaport.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Some of these societies are wealthy, possessing in some instances a
                            considerable capital, and their members are possessed by no other desire
                            but that of developing the resources of the country and occupying
                            themselves as peaceable citizens.</p>
                        <p>While only especially representing our Roumanian coreligionists, we would
                            also venture to remind your excellency that owing to the daily
                            recurrence of prosecution and disasters of the most fearful description
                            our brethren in Russia are living in a state of panic-stricken suspense.
                            In many instances they have realized all their worldly goods and
                            abandoned their occupation, not anticipating any check to their desire
                            to emigrate into Turkey, and are now rapidly consuming the capital with
                            which they had hoped to start in their new home.</p>
                        <p>The matter has become one of the most serious and urgent necessities.
                            Hundreds of thousands of people are awaiting with the utmost anxiety
                            information upon which they can safely act, and your excellency and the
                            great and the philanthropic nation which you represent would be
                            performing an act of the highest benevolence and charity if, owing to
                            your kind intervention in their behalf, they may be relieved from their
                            present dread and extremity, and leave countries in which they have
                            nothing but ill-treatment to anticipate, for one where the experience of
                            their coreligionists has proved they may expect peace and protection,
                            and where they would thankfully become loyal and patriotic subjects of
                            His Magnanimous Majesty the Sultan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: In the interview which I had the
                            honor to have with you yesterday, I begged permission to express my
                            great personal interest in measures for the relief of refugee Jews
                            congregating in the north and to inquire, purely in the way of good
                            offices and unofficially, if His Majesty or the Sublime Porte would be
                            charitably disposed to allow refugee Jews to come into Turkey, and
                            colonize on the public lands.</p>
                        <p>You were good enough to inform me that the subject had been under
                            consideration by His Majesty’s Council, which had decided to allow
                            colonization by those people, provided they did not settle on lands
                            within the limits of Palestine. I asked then in what localities they
                            would be permitted to settle. You replied they might settle about Aleppo
                            and in Mesopotamia, and the region of the Orontes River. I then asked if
                            they would be suffered to come in groups. You replied in groups of two
                            hundred or two hundred and fifty houses, by which I understood families.
                            I inquired if it would be necessary to have an imperial firman, or a
                            permit in form from His Majesty before entering upon the movement of the
                            people. You replied that there was a law already existing which covered
                            the immigration proposed; that as the law had received His Majesty’s
                            sanction no further permit would be required from His Majesty. To my
                            final inquiry, if I was at liberty to notify the parties who would
                            interest themselves in the matter as active managers that they could
                            begin the movement immediately, you said there was no objection to my
                            doing so.</p>
                        <p>Now, excellency, should the movement take on the large proportions I
                            anticipate, there would be not a little responsibility attaching to me;
                            and to relieve me of that, and enable the immigration to be conducted
                            strictly according to the washes and decision of His Majesty and the
                            Sublime Porte, I have the honor to submit if it would not be better that
                            you communicate your replies to me in writing, and in convenient form,
                            that I may in turn communicate them to the persons to be intrusted with
                            the active management. Would you allow a further expression, it is, in
                            my judgment, especially important that the conditions which you desire
                            to impose upon the colonization should be stated with explicitness.
                            Such, for instance, as what the Sublime Porte holds to be the limits of
                            Palestine, and the localities outside those limits to which you prefer
                            the movement should be directed.</p>
                        <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0591"/>
                        <p>Your excellency will of course understand this, and my whole connection
                            with the affair, to be unofficial.</p>
                        <p>It would be a great kindness to the people in question, if your
                            excellency would favor me with the communication requested at your
                            earliest convenience.</p>

                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 2. They will conform to the actual
                                and future laws of the empire.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 3. In common with other subjects of
                                the empire, colonists will be free from all kind of hinderance in
                                the exercise of the religion they profess, and they will enjoy
                                without any distinction the same religious privileges as all the
                                other classes of subjects of the empire. If in the localities that
                                may be given to them by the government for their installation there
                                be any chapels of their rite and these in sufficient number, they
                                will perform their devotions in them, but if they are to form new
                                villages, they will apply for and obtain of the imperial government
                                the permission to erect such chapels as they may need.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 4. In the provinces of the empire
                                that will be found suitable for their installation there will be
                                chosen from government lands the most fertile and most healthy
                                tracts, and to each colonist will be granted such a portion of land
                                as may be suitable to his means, to enable him to carry on
                                agriculture or any other trade.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 5. The colonists being established
                                on government lands, which will be given them gratuitously will be
                                exempt from all land or personal taxation for six years, if they are
                                established in Roumelia, and for twelve years if they are
                                established in Asia.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 6. In like manner the colonists are
                                exempt from military service or its equivalent in money, those in
                                Roumelia for six years, those in Asia for twelve years.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 7. After the expiration of these
                                terms of exemption the colonists will be subjected to all taxes and
                                imposts on the same footing as the rest of the subjects of the
                                empire.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 8. The colonists will not be
                                allowed to sell the land given to them gratuitously by the
                                government, excepting after a lapse of at least twenty years.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 9. Those who before the expiration
                                of this delay may desire to leave the country or change their
                                nationality will restore to the government their lands. In like
                                manner they will be obliged to leave to the government without any
                                compensation whatever all buildings they may have raised upon the
                                lands, which will be no longer regarded as their property.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 10. The colonists will acknowledge
                                the authorities of the Caza or of the Landyok, to which the villages
                                may belong, and little boroughs where they are established, and they
                                will be governed and protected as the other subjects of the
                                empire.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 11. If before the expiration of the
                                term of their exemption these colonists be obliged to change their
                                abode and to establish themselves in any other place of the empire,
                                they will be allowed to do it; but the term of their exemption from
                                all taxation and imposts will still date from the time when the
                                first ground was given to them.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 12. The colonists must not have
                                been criminals in their former country or of doubtful behavior, but
                                must be honest men, laborers and tradesmen. And the imperial
                                government reserves to itself the right to expel from the empire
                                those who may subsequently be proved to have been in their own
                                countries criminals or of bad character.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 13. As each family, wishing to come
                                to Turkey in order to colonize, will have granted to them as much
                                ground as their means require before they start for Turkey,
                                registers will have to be kept, containing minutely and in detail
                                their names, their qualities, their means, and the sum of capital
                                they possess. These must be put up and forwarded to the imperial
                                government by its legations and consulates abroad, where there are
                                any, and it is established that each family must have a capital
                                equal to a sum of at least 60 medjidies in gold (about 1,350 francs,
                                or $54).</item>

                            <item><hi rend="smallcaps">Art</hi>. 14. From the time of their
                                departure from abroad as well as on arrival in Turkey, the consuls
                                of the Porte abroad and the imperial authorities at home will have
                                to give these colonists necessary facilities for the transport of
                                their goods and luggage. Their passports will be given to them free
                                of charge by all the Ottoman consuls.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The council of the Toujimat (of reform) considers it incumbent upon any
                            families desiring to colonize in Turkey to inform the government thereof
                            at least two months before-hand, so that by the resolutions or steps
                            that have already been taken, the government may have time to designate
                            in the provinces of the empire which may be chosen for their
                            colonization convenient lands to be distributed amongst the colonists,
                            so that upon their arrival in Turkey they should not incur loss of time
                            and fatigue. Consequently instructions will be given to the
                            representatives and to the consuls of the empire abroad in conformity
                            therewith.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch of the 9th of June last, No. 98,
                        in relation to a proposed additional charge of 8 per centum on petroleum,
                        has been received and read with interest.</p>
                    <p>Your views on the general subject are in entire accord with those of the
                        Department, and your foresight and vigilante in giving the matter prompt
                        attention meet with its unqualified approval.</p>
                    <p>The subject, so far as it could in its present inchoate condition, has
                        received attentive consideration.</p>
                    <p>The proposed measure, or scheme, as you not inappropriately denominate it,
                        cannot be viewed otherwise by this government than as an act unfriendly to
                        American commerce, and in contravention alike of the spirit of the treaty of
                        1862 between the United States and Turkey and of the acknowledged principles
                        of international law and comity.</p>
                    <p>You will take proper occasion, and in your own way, to make known to the
                        Ottoman Government the disappointment with which this government learns that
                        such a proposition should be held in contemplation for a moment by the
                        Porte, and you will urge upon the minister for foreign relations the
                        impolicy of such a measure at a time when the friendly relations of the two
                        nations rest upon so harmonious a basis. You will also advise the parties
                        who have sought interference to protest against the payment, should the
                        scheme be persisted in. You will also promptly inform the Department of the
                        proceedings in any and every actual case, should any occur, in which the
                        payment may be sought to be enforced. Should the proposed measure not be
                        abandoned, further consideration will be given to the matter, of the results
                        of which you will be promptly advised.</p>
                    <p>I transmit herewith, as a part of the record in the matter under
                        consideration, copies of two letters addressed to the Department by Messrs.
                        Iasigi &amp; Co. and by Messrs. Laforme &amp; Frothingham, of Boston,

                        the storage of petroleum, and whose agents in Turkey, as appears from your

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We beg to call the attention of your
                            Department to the following statement:</p>
                        <p>In October, 1873, the municipality of Smyrna, Turkey, enacted regulations
                            for the safe storage of petroleum, under which importers were required
                            to store this article in warehouses to be located at least two
                            kilometers from the city. Incompliance therewith, we instructed our
                            correspondents in Smyrna, Messrs. Reggio &amp; Belhomme, to erect a
                            ware-house for the storage of our petroleum in Cordelio, a suburb of the
                            city of Smyrna, at a cost of about 100,000 francs. Our warehouse has
                            given entire satisfaction to the authorities and no complaint of
                            irregularity has ever been made. The expense of storage in our warehouse
                            has never exceeded l½ per cent. of the value of the merchandise.</p>
                        <p>We are now informed that there is a proposition seriously pending before
                            the authorities of Smyrna to grant a concession to parties in the city
                            of Constantinople to erect in Smyrna a warehouse to be used exclusively
                            for the storage of petroleum, compelling <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                            importers to store this petroleum in this warehouse, and granting, in
                            fact, a monopoly of the storage of this article in Smyrna to said
                            parties. We are further informed that the monopoly in question proposes
                            to impose a charge of 8 per cent, of the value upon the petroleum stored
                            in said warehouse, refunding to the municipality 1 per cent, for the
                            concession granted!</p>
                        <p>Not only would such a concession be entirely contrary to existing
                            treaties, under which only 8 per cent, ad valorem can be assessed upon
                            imports into Turkey, but it would involve a loss to us of the sum
                            expended for the erection of our warehouse in Cordelio, which would then
                            become useless to us.</p>
                        <p>We therefore appeal to your Department to instruct the United States
                            minister in Constantinople and the United States consul in Smyrna to
                            protect by their intervention our interests, as American citizens, which
                            are so seriously threatened.</p>
                        <p>Yours, respectfully,</p>

                            Smyrna to the acting United States vice-consul at that port, in relation
                            to an extra duty of 8 per cent, which the authorities there wish to
                            impose, under guise of warehousing charges, on imports of petroleum.
                            This duty we feel to be in direct violation of the commercial treaty
                            between Turkey and the United States, and any such action would be
                            prejudicial in the highest degree to our business relations with that
                            country, as the result would be the cessation of all shipments of
                            petroleum to Smyrna.</p>
                        <p>Begging that you will give this matter your early attention, we remain,
                            &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Acting Consul</hi>: We, the undersigned, Jacob
                            Balladur &amp; Co., merchants, established and resident in Smyrna, have
                            the honor, as representatives in this city, by virtue of legal power of
                            attorney, of Messrs. Iasigi &amp; Co., American merchants, established
                            and resident in Boston, No. 30 Kilby street, very respectfully to bring
                            to your notice that the Ottoman Government proposes, we are informed, to
                            burden the importation of petroleum at Smyrna with a supplementary duty
                            of 8 per cent., disguised under the title of warehousing charges, and
                            independent, be it understood, of the customs duty, also of 8 per cent.;
                            in fact, that the authorities at Constantinople, on the recommendation
                            of the Idaré Medjiliss of our city, are on the point of according to one
                            individual the privilege or monopoly of maintaining a warehouse, where
                            all the merchants of our city shall be compelled to store their
                            petroleum and to pay a duty of 8 per cent., under the title of
                            warehousing. Now, in conformity with the limitations of article 3, cited
                            below, of the regulation of October 13 (25), 1873, elaborated by the <pb
                                n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0594"/>local authorities, with the
                            concurrence and adoption of the consular corps of this city, we have
                            constructed, since the date given, large warehouses of stone, where we
                            store the petroleum which the above-mentioned principals send us. During
                            this long preriod of nine years there has been no disaster or even the
                            slightest accident which could authorize or excuse the change in the
                            regulation then in force. On the contrary, the arrangements, as
                            practical and sensible as they were, in conformity with the spirit of
                            the general police regulations of December, 1874, concerning the
                            petroleum trade, have also the merit of reconciling both the public and
                            private interests, and particularly of violating neither the spirit nor
                            the letter of the capitulations and international commercial treaties,
                            according to the terms of which no one in Turkey has a right to collect
                            a duty under any title or on any pretext whatsoever, save the sole
                            customs duty of 8 per cent.</p>
                        <p>To oblige us, in spite of ourselves, to deliver our petroleum to the care
                            of any one individual or his representatives, whoever they may be, to
                            exact from the merchants a new and supplementary duty compelling us to
                            pay, under the specious title or pretext of warehousing charges, a duty
                            of 8 per cent, when our storage expenses amount at the most to scarcely
                            1½ per cent., is, in our opinion, to violate the spirit and the letter
                            of the capitulations and commercial treaties existing between foreign
                            powers and the Sublime Porte. It is for the protection of the rights and
                            interests of our above-named principals that we take, as
                            representatives, the respectful liberty of addressing the present to
                            you, and beg you to submit it with urgency to his excellency the
                            minister of the United States of America at Constantinople. Trusting in
                            his constant solicitude for the defense and protection of the lawful
                            rights and interests of his countrymen, we feel sure that it will
                            promptly determine him upon such measures as this grave and prejudicial
                            state of affairs may suggest to arrest its realization, protesting
                            officially in the most formal and most energetic manner against any
                            collection of a supplementary duty under any pretext or title
                            whatsoever, and holding the Ottoman Government responsible for all
                            damages, foreseen or unforeseen, which may result.</p>

                    <p>It gives me great pleasure to find my action in the matter of the proposed
                        monopoly warehouse in Smyrna so heartily approved, and beg to say that the
                        instructions now sent me shall be attended to. In a conversation had with
                        the minister of foreign affairs since my dispatch No. 98, his excellency
                        expressed his surprise at the proposed scheme of the authorities in Smyrna,
                        and gave me to understand it was new to him, and that he did not understand
                        where it could have originated. In this matter, as in all others, the
                        difficulty is not to get the ministers to see the right or wrong and
                        acknowledge it, but to act.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We respectfully beg to ask your attention
                            to the following:</p>
                        <p>For over forty years our firm has traded with American vessels with La
                            Guayra arid Puerto Cabello, in Venezuela, South America. Two years ago,
                            in accordance with the requirements of the times, we substituted
                            steamers for our sailing vessels, and in order to ascertain what boats
                            were the most suitable, we first chartered English-built steamers. This
                            year we built an iron steamship at William Cramp &amp; Sons’ yard, in
                            Philadelphia, and this same firm is now building a second steamer for
                            our line. It is our intention to run our steamers under the American
                            flag, as we did our sailing vessels.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the ports in Venezuela above named, our main line stops at
                            the island of Curacoa, from whence we run a branch steamer to Maracaibo,
                            the most westerly port of entry pertaining to Venezuela. At Curacoa
                            goods destined for Maracaibo are transhipped in bulk, accompanied with
                            the certified invoices from this country. A light-draught steamer is
                            here necessary, as the bar at the entrance to the harbor of Maracaibo
                            has only 11 feet of water. Such a steamer, adapted to the trade, we had
                            built in Philadelphia one year ago.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th May of this year the Venezuelan Congress decreed that one
                            year from that date, on the expiration of the treaty with Denmark, all
                            goods destined for Venezuelan ports, when transhipped at any of the West
                            India islands, should pay an additional duty of 30 per cent. This decree
                            may or may not be enforced, according to the will of the Executive.</p>
                        <p>At the present time, when American steamship lines are struggling for
                            existence against heavy odds, we ask the good offices of your department
                            with the Executive of Venezuela to suspend the operations of this
                            decree, which will seriously embarrass American trade by steamship.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        your No. 15, of November 1 instant, inclosing copy of a letter from Messrs.
                        Boulton, Bliss &amp; Dallett, of New York, relative to the special duty
                        provided for by decree of the Venezuelan Congress on all goods transhipped
                        from any of the West Indian islands into the republic. Without indicating
                        the source where this complaint originated, I called the attention of the
                        minister of exterior relations to this decree, and informed him that ill
                        effects might come upon the commerce of the United States if the decree
                        should be enforced. I ascertained from the minister that Trinidad and
                        Curacoa generally were points from which smuggling ventures emanated, to the
                        serious disadvantage of Venezuela, and they, particularly the latter, were
                        the rendezvous of disaffected and seditious persons, who used these
                        localities as points of organization for revolutionary movements against the
                        Government of Venezuela. For these reasons the Venezuelan Congress had
                        passed the decree referred to. The purpose was political rather than fiscal,
                        and looked to the suspension of trade between these two islands especially
                        and Venezuela as the price of protecting the government of the republic
                        against revolution and the violation of its revenue laws. I suggested that
                        this course might provoke retaliation from Holland and England; that thereby
                        disaffection would be promoted and the facilities for the hurtful expression
                        of it against the Government of Venezuela would be also increased; that the
                        government could bear political agitation from malcontents better than this
                        loss to its commerce; and finally suggested that the trade #f the United
                        States with ‘South America, owing to the condition of the South American
                        ports, required, in many cases, intermediary points for distribution and
                        transhipment of its products, and that the collection of these differential
                        duties might seriously embarrass our commercial interests. Mr. Seijas
                        responded that there was great force in these considerations; that this
                        legislation, prompted by political motives, was experimental, and its
                        expediency doubtful; and finally, that the Congress would convene in
                        February, and could, and probably would, repeal this law. I have no doubt,
                        if urged thereto, on the ground of preventing hardship and injury to our
                        commerce, the law would be suspended, but I did not deem it prudent at this
                        juncture to make this the only or main reason for a repeal or suspension of
                        the law, but attempted, in addition to this ground of action, to give other
                        considerations that would justify the government in reversing its
                        policy.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since mailing my dispatch No. 36, relative to
                        the special duties proposed in a recent decree of the Congress of Venezuela
                        to be imposed on such European and American commodities as are transhipped
                        from the West Indian islands into the ports of the republic, I am reliably
                        informed that the British Government has recently protested, formally,
                        through its diplomatic representative at this capital, against the
                        enforcement of this decree, on the alleged ground that it violates the
                        provisions of the treaty stipulations in force between the two governments.
                        My information is not official, but is entitled, however to great weight.
                        Such a protest at this time * * will materially increase the probability of
                        a repeal or suspension of the decree. * * *</p>
                    <p>The second section of the decree empowers the Executive to allow, in <pb
                            n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0598"/>certain cases, and as compensation
                        for the extra expenses incurred under the law, a rebate on the duties
                        imposed, but he is not authorized to suspend the operations of the decree.
                        This is the function of the body enacting it, and I suppose that, until the
                        convening of Congress in February, nothing further than a friendly assurance
                        from the Executive of co-operation in the desired direction can be
                        accomplished.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your Nos. 36 of the 29th ultimo, and 39 of the
                        1st instant, have been received. You therein reply to my predecessor’s
                        instruction of November 1, No. 15, in relation to the complaint of Messrs.
                        Boultou, Bliss &amp; Dallett, of New York, touching the additional tax of 30
                        per cent, to be levied on imports from the United States which may reach
                        Venezuela after transhipment in a West Indian colonial port. From your
                        dispatch, and the text of the Venezuelan decree of May 27, 1881, which you
                        transmit, it is seen that the proposed enactment is as objectionable in its
                        effects on American commerce with Venezuela as the representations of the
                        exporters had led the Department to believe, and further, that, contrary to
                        the impression formed here, the Venezuelan Executive cannot suspend the
                        execution of the law, but that revision or relief must be had by the action
                        of the Congress of the republic. It does not appear, on perusing article 2
                        of the decree to which you refer, that, as you say in your No. 39, the
                        Executive can allow a rebate on the duties imposed in the case of foreign
                        goods transhipped in a colonial port, inasmuch as that article refers only
                        to goods coming direct from Europe or the United States to Carupano, La
                        Guayra, or Puerto Cabello, and transhipped there to be carried by coast
                        trade to their ultimate destination in Venezuela, in which case a rebate is
                        granted to compensate for delay and cost of such transhipment. The obnoxious
                        provisions seem to stand alone in article 1 without remedy.</p>
                    <p>The enforcement of this law is fixed to take effect on the termination of the
                        already denounced treaty between Venezuela and Denmark, but the date of such
                        termination is not given. It is desirable to know this.</p>
                    <p>The seventh article of the Danish treaty, unlike the sixth article of our own
                        of 1860, contains a specific provision equalizing duties on goods imported
                        in Danish vessels into Venezuelan ports (and reciprocally), whether those
                        goods come from the place of production or any other place. The British
                        treaty, without containing so specific a clause, necessarily covers the
                        carrying trade between British colonies and Venezuela. Our own treaty,
                        without embracing either provision, gives to United States vessels the
                        treatment of the vessels of Venezuela bringing goods from any country.
                        While, therefore, we may not rely upon our treaty alone, it is perfectly
                        proper for us to maintain an attitude of friendly remonstrance, in the
                        conviction that the Venezuelan Congress <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527"
                            facs="0599"/>will give due heed to the needs of intercourse between
                        Venezuela and the United States.</p>
                    <p>The discreet manner in which you have heretofore presented the issue, as
                        reported in your No. 36, leads to the belief that you will be equally
                        felicitous in obeying the present instruction.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that, in
                        accordance with instructions received from the Department of State, I, in a
                        personal interview with the minister of exterior relations of Venezuela, on
                        December 28, 1881, suggested the desirableness of a congress of the
                        independent states of North and South America, with the view of devising
                        some method by which controversies, arising among them from any cause, could
                        be satisfactorily adjusted otherwise than by a resort to force, so as to
                        avert the evils of war, and informed him that I had received a communication
                        upon this subject from the Secretary of State, which I was instructed to
                        read to him. He promptly replied, that such a measure was in harmony with
                        the policy of Venezuela heretofore, and that he had no doubt that the
                        president of the republic would heartily cooperate in such a movement. On
                        the 29th of December ultimo I read the dispatch of Mr. Secretary Blaine, No.
                        18, of November 29, to the minister of exterior relations, and the same day
                        addressed a communication to him covering a copy of dispatch No. 18, and
                        formally, in the name of the President of the United States, invited the
                        president of the republic to designate two commissioners, who should
                        represent Venezuela in the proposed peace congress. Under authorization of
                        department No. 19, I indicated, in the copy of No. 18 furnished the
                        minister, November 22, 1882, as the day upon which the congress would
                        convene. On December 30 ultimo I submitted to the minister the practical
                        suggestions relative to the conduct of the congress contained in department
                        dispatch No. 20, and at his request, on January 2, I embodied these
                        suggestions in a letter. Of my own motion I intimated that it would be
                        expedient that at least one of the commissioners should understand the
                        English language, to which he responded that both of the representatives of
                        Venezuela should be familiar with the English language, and that the
                        appointments would be made in part with reference to this end. On January 7
                        instant I received from the minister of exterior relations a reply to my
                        communication of December 29 ultimo, in which he recites the objects and
                        character of the congress as outlined in the dispatch of Secretary Blaine,
                        No. 18, and my communication of December 29, transmitting said dispatch,
                        refers to the efforts of Venezuela heretofore, by similar measures but on a
                        more limited scale, to adjust controversies between the Spanish-American
                        republics; refers specially to the efforts of the liberator, Bolivar, to
                        harmonize these communities by the congress of Panama convened in 1825,
                        which received the warm commendations of His Excellency President John <pb
                            n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0600"/>Q. Adams; commends most heartily
                        the disinterested and successful efforts of the United States to compose
                        honorably and by peaceful agencies difficulties heretofore arising betweeu
                        the Spanish-American republics, and the liberal, equal, and just terms upon
                        which she now asks the co-operation of all the independent American states
                        in perfecting this work of peace and fraternity, and concludes by declaring
                        that the President of Venezuela accepts with pleasure the invitation of His
                        Excellency the President of the United States, and will, in due time,
                        designate two commissioners, furnished with needful powers and instructions,
                        who shall represent Venezuela in the peace congress to convene at Washington
                        City, November 22, 1882. On the same day and of the same date I received
                        from the minister a communication in response to my letter of January 2
                        instant, in which he expresses approval of the practical suggestions
                        submitted, and commends the liberality and thoughtfulness of the Government
                        of the United States in undertaking to furnish a suitable hall for the
                        meeting of the commissioners, and at its own expense to provide for all the
                        material requirements of the Congress. I inclose a copy of my letter of
                        December 29 ultimo, and a copy and translation of the response thereto by
                        the minister of exterior relations; a copy of my letter of January 2
                        instant, and copy and translation of the reply of the minister thereto; also
                        a copy of my letter of January 9 instant, in reply to the two
                        communications, herein referred to, of the minister of exterior
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>The enthusiasm and earnestness with which this humane measure of the
                        Government of the United States., has been met by this government is most
                        gratifying, and the sincerity of the feeling and purpose manifested by them
                        cannot be questioned.</p>

                            that the President of the United States of America contemplates the

                            in accord with the spirit of a liberal and advanced civilization, as to
                            commend in the judgment of the President this humane and philanthropic

                            that I received and have submitted to the consideration of the President
                            of the Republic the note of your legation of 29th ultimo, in which you
                            state that the President of the United States of America proposes the
                            formation and convention of a peace congress that shall be composed of
                            all the independent states of North and South America, to be convened at
                            Washington on the 22d of November, 1882, with the object of devising and
                            adopting some feasible means, other than the appeal to force, for the
                            adjustment of the controversies that may arise from questions of
                            boundaries or other causes between the independent political communities
                            of the Western Hemisphere, or between different factions or sections of
                            the same, in order to avert the miseries and burdens of war.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency refers for the explanation of the nature and objects of
                            the proposed congress to the letter of his excellency Mr. Blaine,
                            Secretary of State, that you inclosed to me and had read, to me
                            before.</p>
                        <p>After the illustrious American had heard the reading of both
                            communications, he expressed the opinion that the project portrayed in
                            them was grand and worthy of being accepted with enthusiasm by all the
                            Spanish American republics, for this idea is the line of their wishes,
                            and coincides with the one that inspired Bolivar in the formation of the
                            congress of Panama, so warmly applauded by the President of the United
                            States, Mr. John Quincy Adams.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly a source of satisfaction that the first republic of the
                            world—loyal to her noble antecedents—in view of the growing tendency of
                            these countries to look to arbitration, and not to arms, for the
                            solution of international difficulties, and to consider her as their
                            friend and mediator, should, after having interposed on various
                            occasions her good offices, and succeeded in preventing conflicts, or in
                            putting an end to those exist ant, without pretensions of dictatorship
                            and solely as a proof of common friendship, inspired only by
                            considerations of philanthropy and civilization, take charge of a matter
                            which concerns mainly the other countries of the western continent, and
                            should utilize the great influence derived from her immense progress and
                            wealth to prevent the horrible calamities of wars between brethren, and
                            should consent to preside over the deliberations of a peace congress
                            that proposes to devise the means of ending future disagreements without
                            an appeal to war and its terrible legacies.</p>
                        <p>And this satisfaction increases when contemplating the United States
                            acting in a manner that saves the independence and other attributes of
                            sovereignty, and especially the equality between her and the nations by
                            which the congress is to be formed, and offering to employ all her
                            influence in harmonizing whatever antagonism of interest may exist
                            between the states which answer to this call, and even assuming the
                            expenses for the inauguration of the congress, interpreting and
                            publishing of its acts, &amp;c., as your excellency has informed me in
                            your note of later date.</p>
                        <p>So exalted a conception bears with it the assurance of its accomplishment
                            by the influence of the government which undertakes to carry it into
                            effect. So there is sufficient ground to hope that on this occasion the
                            efforts for the suppression of war between the countries of the American
                            continent will not be frustrated. If this is attained the example will
                            extend its influence to the other hemisphere, and the world will behold
                            the disappearance of this calamity, and established in its place, for
                            the comfort of humanity and as an evident mark of progress, practices of
                            love for life and the properties of men linked by fraternal
                            intercourse.</p>
                        <p>It is designed to put in practice the same idea that was in the
                            Venezuelan mind when, after the 19th of April of 1810, and as a heroic
                            cry proclaiming the independence, they repeated the words “hail to free
                            America.”</p>
                        <p>It is that provision which the immortal Bolivar, when in the midst of a
                            war to the death, addressed to the Argentines, when he invited them to a
                            fraternal embrace on top of the Andes, in the center of the continent,
                            on the day of the last victory.</p>
                        <p>It is that thought which Bolivar conceived as the complement of the work
                            of independence and for the realization of which he convoked in 1825 the
                            Congress of Panama. It is finally the luminous design for which,
                            afterwards, other continental congresses were convened; among them, the
                            one of Lima of 1864, at which Venezuela assisted.</p>
                        <p>The President of the republic, which has had occasions for appreciating
                            the goodwill and mediation of the United States in her behalf, and which
                            hopes all from the solid and permanent peace between the countries of
                            America, accepts with pleasure the invitation to the peace congress at
                            Washington, and in due time he will designate the two commissioners for
                            Venezuela, providing them with the needful powers and instructions.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Acknowledging the receipt of your No. 25, and
                        referring to my No. 36 relative to the decree imposing special duties on
                        products of Europe and the United States, when transhipped in the West
                        Indian Islands into Venezuela, I have to say that the favorable
                        prognostications of my last dispatches were based upon my conversation with
                        the minister of exterior relations. Recently the minister informed me that
                        he had submitted my views to President Blanco, and that he had been
                        instructed to inform me that the objects of the law were the suppression of
                        smuggling, and the prevention of revolutionary plots against the existing
                        government, and further that the President believed, in view of the fact
                        that the United States had no colonial appendages upon which to distribute
                        its favors and trade, that this law would lead to a more direct trade
                        between the republics, and would ultimately enable the United States to
                        secure the trade that England, France, and Germany now derived from
                        Venezuela, and thus be ultimately beneficial to the commerce of the United
                        States. I do not accept as just the conclusions stated. I am sure that this
                        decree proceeds upon a misapprehension of the industrial facts of the case,
                        and in ignorance of the laws of trade. I do not believe that it will
                        suppress smuggling, but on the contrary facilitate it, nor do I believe it
                        will prevent discontent or the operations of political malcontents, but will
                        further and aid their plans. Yet I am sure that the true grounds of enacting
                        the decree are stated, and I believe that the President thinks it will be
                        ultimately helpful to American commerce. Venezuela, outside of a few
                        coasting vessels, has no mercantile marine; all her foreign carrying trade
                        is under other flags than that of Venezuela. Under the circumstances, the
                        public men of Venezuela have not studied and do not understand this
                        commercial question, and it is difficult to get them to appreciate the
                        argument submitted in this connection.</p>
                    <p>President Blanco and the minister of exterior relations have each discussed
                        matters of public moment with me repeatedly, and have invited suggestions
                        from me on such subjects, and have thanked me for such as I have submitted.
                        Under this privilege, I am preparing a memoranda of reflections upon this
                        decree, especially in its political and commercial effects upon the two
                        republics, with the view of securing the attention and action of the
                        President, and the minister of exterior relations says that he will
                        guarantee careful consideration of the same. I present it unsigned,
                        personally and as a friend of the two countries, because I can thus present
                        considerations that could not appropriately appear in an official
                        communication on the subject. I do not despair of success, either to secure
                        a repeal of the decree, or else such a modification as will protect the
                        commerce of steamers now plying between Venezuela and the United States. I
                        will hereafter furnish a copy of the memoranda submitted by me.</p>

                        of this government, in the matter, was regulated by an existing statute; but
                        that they were prepared to entertain specific propositions from the

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my No. 67, relative to the decree
                        of June 11, 1881, imposing additional duties of 30 per cent. on products
                        from Europe and the United States, when transhipped from any West Indian
                        port into Venezuela, I have to inform you that I have repeatedly and fully
                        discussed, with the minister of exterior relations, the effect of this law
                        upon the commerce of both Venezuela and the United States, and have entered
                        a friendly remonstrance against its enforcement. The minister gave me
                        respectful hearing, and requested me to put my views in writing. He also
                        submitted my reflections to the President of the Republic. In the absence of
                        any instructions from the Department on the point, I concluded to rest the
                        case on a verbal statement thereof. In conclusion, I suggested that the
                        government, if the law should be enforced, might mitigate its hardships upon
                        American commerce by giving the American line of steamers, not only the
                        benefit of the rebate provided for in Article 2 of the law, but by allowing
                        them, through their smaller steamers, the right, without forfeiture of their
                        American charters to distribute from Puerto Cabello to Maracaibo and other
                        subsidiary points the cargoes designed for them. Or else the administrative
                        officer, the President, might construe this law, so that the disabilities
                        attached to transhipment of articles at Curacoa for Maracaibo should not be
                        extended to such articles from the United States as were covered by through
                        and continuous consular invoices. I entertained the hope for some time that
                        one of these expedients for relief would be adopted, but my expectations
                        thus far have not been satisfactorily realized.</p>
                    <p>On April 12 instant an executive decree, approved by the federal council, was
                        enacted looking to the enforcement of the decree of June 4, 1881, and the
                        same was promulgated April 20 instant in the Gaceta Oficial. I inclose a
                        printed official copy and translation of the executive decree referred to.
                        The law of June 4, 1881, goes into effect May 3, 1882.</p>
                    <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0605"/>
                    <p>The executive can yet give the relief sought, in either of the suggested
                        methods, if so disposed; and the language of the decree just promulgated in
                        Article 2 thereof is supposed to look to such measure of relief. It imposes
                        restrictions upon national vessels when engaged in distributing foreign
                        cargoes from La Guayra, Puerto Cabello, or Carupano to other ports, in that
                        it forbids participation currently by them in the coasting trade proper. The
                        form of expression is also peculiar. The article declares: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The vessels receiving transhipments in La Guayra, &amp;c., of
                                merchandise, &amp;c., to be carried to other eastern or western
                                ports of the republic, &amp;c., when (or if) they are national shall
                                not be allowed to carry at the same time merchandise in the coasting
                                trade.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>This conditional form of expression would suggest that other than national
                        vessels might engage in the work of distribution of foreign cargoes in these
                        cases, and the restrictions imposed upon the national vessels makes the
                        impression that the purpose of the decree is to discourage them from
                        engaging in this particular trade. The representatives here of the American
                        line are inclined to take this view of the law, and are disposed to construe
                        it as a tacit concession in favor of American commerce.</p>

                        to those of most other commercial countries. A reference to Article XII of
                        the Consular Regulations of 1881 will show the nature and extent of our laws

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my No. 464, to Mr. Carter’s No.
                        105, and to your dispatch numbered 151, all relative to the custody of
                        ship’s papers at the ports of this country, and the desireableness of a
                        change of the existing practice in these ports, I have to say that on the 3d
                        instant, I brought the matter in a very earnest but friendly manner again to
                        the attention of Mr. Seijas, suggesting the sufficiency of the provisions of
                        the statute of the United States on the subject, and presenting reasons why
                        a change should be made by which ship’s papers should be deposited with the
                        consular officers of their respective countries. Mr. Seijas appeared to be
                        quite friendly to the idea of a change, indicated that he would bring the
                        subject to the attention of the proper minister, and make a strong
                        recommendation in relation thereto to the President; and, on my suggesting
                            <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0607"/>that I supposed the
                        extraordinary powers of the President were sufficient to enable him to make
                        a provisional decree in relation to the matter, subject to the future
                        approval of Congress, he indicated that he thought I was not mistaken in
                        that view. On the 7th instant (in the course of conversation on another
                        matter), Mr. Seijas voluntarily recurred to the subject, and indicated that
                        he had brought the matter to the attention of the proper minister, who would
                        make a study of it, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, I am disposed to think that a change in relation to the
                        practice in question will be made, and that before a great while.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Department dispatches to Mr.
                        Carter numbered 15 and 25, and to Mr. Carter’s dispatches numbered 36, 39,
                        67, and 107, all relative to the recent measure adopted by this government,
                        imposing an additional duty of 30 per cent. upon commodities proceeding from
                        foreign colonies to the ports of this country, or from Europe or the United
                        States to the ports of this country, <hi rend="italic">with transhipment in
                            such colonies</hi>, I have to say that my information is that this
                        measure went into effect on the 3d ultimo, and that some duty has been
                        collected in pursuance of it.</p>
                    <p>I presume I shall receive, at an early day, instructions respecting the
                        present phase of the question. Meantime, in view of the extraordinary
                        character of the measure, and of the spirit of the instructions already sent
                        to this legation respecting it, I shall deem it right to take some step in
                        relation thereto at as early a day as practicable. As at present advised, my
                        view is short. It is to request this government to so modify the measure as
                        to exempt from its operation all consignments of goods from the ports of the
                        United States <hi rend="italic">which are covered by through consular
                            invoices and bills of lading for the ports of this country</hi>.
                        Although the goods so covered may be stored and transhipped, or simply
                        transhipped, in any of the colonies embraced in the measure. I presume such
                        a modification, if made, would have to be general, and apply equally to the
                        commerce of all nations trading with this country—and, so much the better
                        for that, I would judge.</p>
                    <p>Although Congress has adjourned, my impression is that the extrordinary
                        powers which the President is in the habit of employing are sufficient to
                        enable him to make a remedial decree in the premises, if he shall be
                        disposed to do so.</p>
                    <p>I intended to have opened the matter to Mr. Seijas, in the sense above
                        suggested, on Saturday, the 10th instant, and called twice at the foreign
                        ministry without finding him in. As soon as practicable after the dispatch
                        of the present mail, I purpose bringing the matter to his attention, and
                        fully expect to have something further to communicate on the subject by the
                        next succeeding mail.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my No. 487, of date 13th instant,
                        I have to say that on Saturday the 17th instant I had a conversation with
                        Mr. Seijas, in which I presented to him the view suggested in my said No.
                        487 respecting the additional duty of 30 per cent, therein referred to. I
                        stated to him, in substance, that I had no doubt whatever that his
                        government did not intend to injure the commerce of the United States with
                        Venezuela in imposing this additional 30 per cent. of duty on commodities
                        coming to Venezuela by way of colonial ports, but that we felt that this was
                        the effect of the measure; and I presented to him the idea of so modifying
                        the measure in question as to make it inapplicable to consignments of goods
                        coming by way of these ports, but covered by through consular invoices and
                        bills of lading to Venezuelan ports; and I added a remark to the effect
                        that, so far as I then saw, this would effectually remedy the mischief the
                        measure was working to our commerce. He stated, in substance, that the
                        object of the law was to break up the smuggling that was going on from
                        Curaçoa and Trinidad, and * * * that it was the opinion of the government
                        that the measure would be beneficial to the commerce of foreign states by
                        breaking down smuggling.</p>
                    <p>I indicated to him that I did not concur in the latter view; pointed out to
                        him how the measure interfered with the introduction of our commodities by
                        deeper draught steamers to Curaçoa, and by one of shallower draft thence to
                        Maracaibo, and the like interference with the introduction of our
                        commodities, as I understand the matter, first to Port of Spain in Trinidad,
                        and thence by steamers adapted to the service up the Orinoco. I indicated to
                        him that the object of putting a stop to smuggling was certainly a good one,
                        but that in my opinion the measure in question would retain all the efficacy
                        it might have as against smuggling after being modified as I had suggested;
                        that I was clearly of opinion that the exempting of goods from the operation
                        of the measure which proceeded from the United States with through consular
                        invoices and bills of lading had no more tendency to encourage smuggling,
                        although the goods should stop temporarily at an intermediate colonial port
                        than if they were sent directly through; and I suggested to him that if his
                        government should see the matter in the same light, 1 supposed it would make
                        the modification I had pointed out. I understood him to give a not very
                        hearty assent to this suggestion, and he made a remark to the effect, as I
                        understood him, that he thought it would be difficult for the government to
                        so see it. He said he would consider the matter, and inform the President of
                        what I had said about it. I intimated to him that I would see him further on
                        the subject, and purpose doing so at an early day.</p>

                        ultimo, relative to the additional duty of 30 per cent. imposed upon imports
                        from the United States into the ports of Venezuela, I have now to inclose,
                        for your information, a copy of a further communication addressed to the
                        Department by Messrs. Boulton, Bliss, and Dallet, respecting that matter. In
                        it they ask that you may be instructed to secure, if possible, a
                        modification of the decree of the Venezuelan Government, in order that their
                        merchandise shipped from New York destined for Maracaibo, when accompanied
                        by proper consular invoices, from the consuls of that republic in this
                        country may be allowed transhipment at Curaçoa to the firm’s branch steamer
                        trading between the ports of Venezuela.</p>
                    <p>Your above-mentioned dispatch shows your appreciation and understanding of
                        the present situation, and your action, looking to the obtaining of such
                        liberal and just changes in existing regulations through the executive of
                        that government, is approved. In thus endeavoring to materially benefit our

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We beg respectfully to represent that on
                            the 21st October, 1881, we addressed the Department on the subject of a
                            decree contemplated by the Executive of Venezuela; and again on the 5th
                            of January last, in reply to a communication from the Department on the
                            same subject.</p>
                        <p>The decree referred to, imposing a discriminating duty of 30 per cent.
                            upon all merchandise imported into Venezuela from any of the West India
                            Islands, was promulgated on the 12th of April last. The object of the
                            decree is to discountenance importations from the West India Islands and
                            encourage importations from primary markets. Under a provision of the
                            decree, merchandise shipped from this country destined for Maracaibo,
                            even though accompanied by consular invoices, cannot be transhipped at
                            any of the West India Islands to the port of Maracaibo without paying
                            the additional duty of 30 per cent. This provision affects very
                            injuriously our line of American steamships trading from this port with
                            Laguayra and Peurto Cabello, and through the Island of Curaçoa, with the
                            port of Maracaibo, obliging us to abstain altogether from taking
                            merchandise for the latter port, as owing to the draft of water the
                            steamer cannot cross the bar near Maracaibo. Previous to the
                            promulgation of this decree, the steamers transhipped this cargo at
                            Curaçoa to a branch steamer (built at Philadelphia specially for the
                            trade) drawing only ten to ten and a half feet of water, which is the
                            greatest draft at which a vessel can cross the bar with safety.</p>
                        <p>What we particularly desire is, that merchandise shipped from this port
                            destined for Maracaibo, when accompanied by consular invoices from the
                            consulate here, shall be allowed transhipment at Curaçoa to our branch
                            steamer trading between those <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0610"
                            />ports. We see no good reason why this privilege should not be
                            accorded, as the consular invoices (copies of which are sent by the
                            Venezuelan consul to the Department at Caracas) would be sufficient
                            proof that the merchandise was shipped from a primary market, and would
                            in no wise prejudice the object of the decree. European merchandise is
                            thus allowed transhipment to Venezuela from this port.</p>
                        <p>We respectfully ask the good offices of the Department to secure a
                            modification or more liberal interpretation of this decree, so injurious
                            to American steamship interests.</p>
                        <p>We may add that none of the European steamship lines trading with
                            Venezuela go there direct. All call at intermediate ports to discharge
                            and load cargo before landing their European cargo at ports in
                            Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>We remain, &amp;c.,</p>

                        been received. It relates to the exaction by Venezuela of 30 per cent.
                        additional duty on the cargoes of vessels which may have touched at European
                        colonial ports prior to their entrance into ports of Venezuela. It would be
                        much regretted if your remonstrances against this action, and your
                        proposition for a modification of the charge, should prove abortive.</p>
                    <p>The measure bears with such severity on the trade between the United States
                        and that country that it is expected you will not lose sight of it, but will
                        on every proper occasion endeavor to have a favorable change effected.</p>

                        accompaniments, two copies of the Gaceta Oficial, of July 19, 1882,
                        containing a decree of the President, of date September 3, 1881, and a
                        programme for the celebration of the 24th day of July, 1883—the centennial
                        birthday of Bolivar. The decree indicates that all the Spanish-American
                        republics, the Republic of the United States, the French Republic, the Swiss
                        Confederation, Great Britain, and other nations, will be invited to take

                        I will note that the 31st day of July is set apart—as I translate from the
                        programme—for: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my No. 552, of 17th ultimo,
                        respecting a contemplated interview with the President, with a view of
                        speaking to him about the matter of the custody of ships’ papers, &amp;c., I
                        have to say that on the 28th ultimo I had an extended interview with him
                        upon that and other matters. Upon the subject being introduced, he asked
                        what was the reason for the desired change in respect to the custody of
                        ships’ papers. I stated, in the first place, that I understood it to be a
                        general practice of the commercial nations of the world to accord the
                        custody of ships’ papers to the consuls of the nations to which the ships
                        belonged, and that my information was to the effect that only a few of the
                        Spanish American states offered exceptions to this practice—as far as the
                        commerce of the United States extends. I understood him to indicate in reply
                        that he had an impression that the general practice was as I had stated, but
                        that he did not regard this as the reason that should be given for a change.
                        I then made a statement to the purport that I thought I had received reports
                        from one or more United States consular officers in Venezuela to the effect
                        that in some cases ships’ papers had been lost by the local port
                        authorities. I understood him to indicate that he thought this must be
                        erroneous, and that, if it was so, it would be an incidental but not a
                        fundamental reason for a change. I then made a statement to the effect that
                        the comity of nations required that their respective consuls in foreign
                        countries should be the custodians of their respective ships’ papers; and
                        that, for a nation to withhold such custody from foreign consuls, whom it
                        had received and recognized as such, carried with it an inappropriate
                        element of suspicion or distrust. <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0612"
                        />To this the President made answer to the effect that the desire to take
                        the custody of such papers from the customs officers of the country imported
                        a like converse suspicion or distrust. To which I responded, in substance,
                        that I did not regard this view as apposite, for the reason that a nation’s
                        consular officers in foreign countries are the natural and appropriate
                        custodians of its ships’ papers; that such custody comes within the scope of
                        the consular function.</p>
                    <p>The result upon the point was that the President suggested, or requested,
                        that I would obtain from my government a statement of the reason why the
                        change in question is desired, in order that he might present it in his next
                        message to Congress, which meets in February. I told him I could do so, but
                        that I thought no other reasons would be forthcoming but those I had given.
                        * * *</p>
                    <p>I suspect that this last lies at the bottom of the matter, and is the
                        fundamental source of the general usage of nations in according the custody
                        of ships’ papers to the resident consular officers of the foreign countries
                        to which the ships belong. I presume a nation, in the exercise of its
                        sovereign powers, has a right, if it sees fit, to require that such papers
                        be deposited with its own customs officers; but it appears to me quite
                        clear, as a general principle, that such action must be regarded as a
                        violation of the proprieties which comity enjoins between friendly
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>The interview above referred to took place at Antimino, some miles from
                        Caracas, where the President was stopping, not having then resumed his
                        functions, as indeed he has not yet done so. Mr. Seijas, the minister of
                        exterior relations, rode out with me, and was present at the interview. On
                        our way back to Caracas I indicated to him that I should examine the
                        consular reports to which I had alluded in conversation with the President,
                        and bring the accurate state of the matter to his attention. I found upon
                        subsequent examination that my recollection had been quite correct. I found
                        that in a communication from Mr. Plumacher he says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>It has occurred several times that parts of papers of American
                                vessels have been lost by the custom-house authorities, and the
                                vessels had to leave without them, the officials declaring that they
                                never received them.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>And in a communication from Mr. Lacombe I found the statement: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>At this port, the crew list of three of our vessels could not be
                                found on the day of their clearance, and I had to provide them with
                                a new one. I have been informed by the ex-French consul at this port
                                that the same loss of papers had occurred to some French
                                vessels.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>On the 27th instant I recalled Mr. Seijas’ attention to the matter, read to
                        him the foregoing extracts from the communications of Messrs. Plumacher and
                        Lacombe, indicated to him that they completely authenticated what I had said
                        to the President on the point (to which he appeared to assent), and
                        requested him to inform the President in the premises. He made a memorandum,
                        and said he would do so.</p>
                    <p>Now as to the practical point of the business. In pursuance of the suggestion
                        or request of the President, I recommend that you furnish me, as soon as
                        practicable, with a statement of the reasons why it is desired by our
                        government that the custody of our ships’ papers in the ports of Venezuela
                        should be committed to our consular officers, with direction that I
                        communicate a copy of such statement to the minister of exterior relations
                        of this government. I hope that this course may be the means of bringing
                        about the desired change.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my No. 553, I have the honor to
                        say that on the 28th of September I had an interview with the President in
                        relation to the 30 per cent. additional duty, and other matters. As respects
                        the additional duty, the practical result was that he was opposed to a
                        change of the law which would allow through invoiced goods to land for
                        reshipment at any of the ports of the islands to shipments from which the 30
                        per cent. additional duty applies, but expressed himself as inclined to be
                        personally favorable to a change of the law which would allow transhipment
                        of through invoiced goods at the ports of these islands, and indicated that
                        he was considering this point. At this stage I thought it proper to let the
                        matter rest a while. On the 27th ultimo, upon inquiry of Mr. Seijas, I
                        learned that no action had been taken on the point. At an early day I
                        purpose renewing the matter, and urging at least a change that will allow of
                        transhipment, without abandoning the pursuit of a more thorough and
                        efficient change. The President has not yet resumed his functions.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit, herewith, copy of a communication
                        addressed to me by many prominent trading houses of New York, concerning the
                        present discriminating duty of 30 per cent., in addition to the regular
                        tariff charges, which is collected in Venezuelan ports on goods bound
                        thither from the United States, and transhipped while in transit at Curaçoa
                        or any other West Indian port.</p>
                    <p>The Department’s instructions for more than a year past, both to Mr. Carter
                        and to yourself, have shown the lively interest with which this matter is
                        viewed by this government, and the desire felt and repeatedly expressed that
                        a remedy should be urged for a state of things entirely inconsistent with
                        the prosecution of honest commerce and the building up of the intimate
                        commercial relationship between the United States and Venezuela which is so
                        much to the interest of both countries. Your dispatches on the subject have
                        shown a hopeful spirit on the part of the Venezuelan Government that justice
                        might be done in this matter.</p>
                    <p>It is thought to be self-evident that whatever abuses the revenues of
                        Venezuela may have to fear from irregular channels of trade cannot exist as
                        between that country and the United States in the presence of a wise
                        legislation there, providing that through invoices of shipments, certified
                        by the consuls of Venezuela in the United States, and verified by the like
                        officers in the port of transhipment.</p>
                    <p>Commerce by way of transhipment and transit is on many routes of
                        international intercourse recognized as an indispensable fact, to be
                        regulated <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0614"/>and facilitated by
                        judicious legislation. A prohibitory measure, like that of which we have so
                        abundant cause to complain, cannot but be injurious alike to the country
                        which thus cuts itself of from profitable, and to that whose export trade is
                        so unreasonably curtailed.</p>
                    <p>Your last report on the subject intimated that favorable action on the part
                        of the Venezuelan legislature might be near at hand. It seems desirable that
                        you should continue to press the matter on the attention of the executive as
                        well, and ask that its influence be used to induce proper legislation in
                        this respect. There is reason to believe that President Guzman Blanco is
                        favorably disposed to obtain relief in this connection. That he should
                        exhibit such a disposition is only natural, in view of the repeated
                        evidences of friendship and esteem which his government has shown toward
                        ours, and which we have had pleasure in manifesting also in return. It may,
                        therefore, aid toward a final disposal of the question if, in addition to
                        your representations to the minister of foreign relations, you were to avail
                        yourself of any friendly opportunity of conversation with President Guzman
                        Blanco to impress him with the strong desire we feel that this unfair
                        discrimination should be done away with.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The undersigned merchants, established in
                            the city of New York, engaged in the shipping and the sale of American
                            goods for and to the West India Islands and the importation into the
                            United States of South American produce, respectfully call your
                            attention to the great detriment brought to their trade by the
                            differential duties of an additional 30 per cent. levied by the
                            Government of Venezuela on goods imported into Venezuela from said
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>The proximity of Venezuela to the British island of Trinidad, the Danish
                            island of St. Thomas, and the Dutch island of Curaçoa, had made them,
                            after years of careful work, very valuable points of indirect connection
                            between the United States and Venezuela, through the agency of former
                            residents of those islands who subsequently established in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>By the establishment of the differential duties, the direct trade of the
                            United States with those islands and the indirect trade with Venezuela
                            have suffered material detriment.</p>
                        <p>Of the several sailing vessels that had been actively running between New
                            York and said islands, scarcely any remain in the line, and steamers
                            that formerly used to go every fortnight with full share of cargo for
                            those pores now hardly get enough freight to pay their continuing in the
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>While the business between New York and those islands is thus decreasing,
                            the direct trade with Venezuela gets no proportionate increase in any
                            but exclusively American products such as flour, lard, kerosene,
                            &amp;c., or such articles as cannot begot from Europe, because the
                            largest number of houses in Venezuela are European firms which, engaged
                            for years in business with European markets, import from there all other
                            goods, such as cotton fabrics, machineries, agricultural implements,
                            tinware, boots and shoes, candles, soaps, lamps, glassware, perfumeries,
                            plated goods, clocks, watches, books, canned meats, preserved fruits,
                            liquors, matches, jewelries, ropes, blocks, oars, and other
                            ship-chandlery articles, straw paper, writing-paper, envelopes, wires,
                            furniture, trunks, sewing-machines, and scores of other articles which
                            it would be too long to enumerate and in which the United States, in
                            competition with Europe, had, of recent years, established very valuable
                            indirect connection with Venezuela through those islands.</p>
                        <p>In the like manner, the United States used to export to those islands
                            quantities of East Indian and Chinese goods from bonded warehouses here,
                            such as rice, mattings, fire-crackers, cassia, &amp;c., all of which
                            those islands, through their established trade with the United States
                            and the greater facilities to get the same from here than from <pb
                                n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0615"/>Europe, used to import
                            constantly from here to send to Venezuela. Said articles are now going
                            from Europe to Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>Further does the trade of New York suffer from the circumstance that a
                            great portion of the Venezuelan products, which formerly were purchased
                            by merchants of those islands for shipment to New York, are now taken by
                            European houses in Venezuela for shipment to Europe, owing to the lack
                            of traffic between those islands and Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>It may be well to observe that all those detriments which Venezuela is
                            thus causing to the direct trade between itself and the West India
                            Islands and to the commerce of the United States, in the indirect manner
                            above described, are likely to prove ultimately to the disadvantage of
                            Venezuela, as lines of steamers now running between the United States
                            and West Indian Islands, and touching at Venezuelan ports, and which
                            lines were established in connection with the trade of those islands
                            with Venezuela, are likely to seek employment in some combination of
                            trade with New Grenada.</p>
                        <p>Knowing the great regard in which the government at Washington is
                            deservedly held by the Government of Venezuela, we take the liberty to
                            request the honorable Secretary of State to use his good offices with
                            Venezuela, in order to annul the decree of differential duties on goods

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 570 of the 31st ultimo has been
                        received. You therein report a conversation had with President Guzman
                        Blanco, on the 28th October, concerning the matter of the custody of ships’
                        papers in the ports of Venezuela, in the course of which the President
                        suggested that you obtain from this government a statement of the reason why
                        a change in this respect is desired by us.</p>
                    <p>You have yourself already made known to the President several very convincing
                        reasons why the practice in Venezuela of demanding that the custody of
                        ships’ papers while in port be confided to the Venezuelan officers is not in
                        consonance with the practice of nations or with commercial interests. Your
                        grounds were good, as far as they went, but the principles underlying the
                        question are broader, and involve the doctrine of reciprocity under treaty
                        and international maritime laws.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, it is proper that the President should be disabused of
                        any impression he may have formed that the matter is brought up as an
                        innovation. It has for more than fifty years been the occasion of discussion
                        and remonstrance with various nations of Spanish America; and if it be now
                        revived in connection with Venezuela, it is because it seems necessary to
                        the best interests of both countries that an anomalous practice should not
                        exist between them in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The discussion with Colombia is in point. In 1876 a general movement of the
                        foreign representatives at Bogota was made to secure the abrogation of a law
                        which required the delivery of the papers of foreign vessels to the local
                        port officers. An arrangement then concluded diplomatically set the matter
                        at rest by recognizing the right of the consul of the ship’s nationality to
                        have the custody of the ships’ papers of their national vessels, and the law
                        has since been repealed.</p>
                    <p>I transmit, herewith, for your information, copies of two dispatches <pb
                            n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0616"/>from Mr. Dichman, then our minister
                        at Bogota, in which the merits of the demand are forcibly presented.
                        Although the circumstances made the argument somewhat special, as applying
                        to a specific law, and to the peculiar <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of
                        Colon and Panama as free ports, you will find in these dispatches ample
                        material for fortifying your representations to the Venezuelan Government in
                        the premises. You may, also, profitably consult the remaining correspondence
                        on the subject, found in the volumes of foreign relations for 1875, 1879,
                        and 1880, which are, or should be, in the library of your legation.</p>
                    <p>It may be convenient to note herein, briefly, a few points to which
                        prominence should be given.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, the existing rule in Venezuela is deemed to be in
                        contravention of the spirit of perfect equality and reciprocity of commerce
                        and navigation between the two countries, as stipulated in the abrogated
                        treaty of 1836, and as pervading the existing treaty of 1860. The law of the
                        United States, following the usage of most civilized countries, provides
                        that the custody of the papers of foreign ships shall rest with the consuls
                        of their nations, and this because such custody is deemed essential to that
                        consular control over national vessels which is stipulated in all our
                        treaties. It cannot be expected that the United States will unreservedly
                        yield to the authorities of a foreign state a measure of control over our
                        vessels in their ports which is not permitted by our own law to be exercised
                        by our own officers in our own ports, over foreign vessels, except as a
                        retaliatory measure in the absence of reciprocity. In this connection it may
                        be well for you to examine as to the provisions of Venezuelan law touching
                        the custody of the papers of Venezuelan vessels in foreign ports. I make
                        this suggestion because in the discussion of this question with Colombia it
                        was found that the Colombian law was strangely inconsistent in requiring
                        Colombian consuls abroad to take charge of the papers of vessels of their
                        nation, while denying a reciprocal practice to foreign consuls in Colombia.
                        If a like law should be found on the Venezuelan statute books, no stronger
                        argument in our favor could be devised.</p>
                    <p>You should also, in this relation, call attention to the 26th article of the
                        treaty of 1860, and ask how it is expected that an American consul can <hi
                            rend="italic">exhibit</hi> the register and crew-roll of an American
                        vessel in proceedings for the arrest of deserters, if at no time he is
                        permitted to have possession of those papers.</p>
                    <p>In the second place, apart from considerations of reciprocity founded on
                        treaty, the sacredness of the principles of reciprocity as an enduring basis
                        of international intercourse under the law of nations may be forcibly
                        invoked to sustain our position. A vessel, under a civilized flag, on the
                        high seas or in a foreign port, possesses a national life of which its
                        papers are the strongest evidence. They are to all intents a part of the
                        vessel itself. To assume that by the act of entering a friendly port, a
                        vessel is to be stripped of that which is in a large measure essential to
                        the proof of its nationality, and to await the pleasure of a local foreign
                        officer before such part of its life can be restored to it, is inconsistent
                        with international principles and usage. Hence, we find that the custom of
                        nations (with but few exceptions in the Spanish American ports of South
                        America) recognizes the consul of the vessel’s nationality as the sole
                        guardian of all national rights appertaining thereto. The exceptions to
                        which I refer (and which are happily growing fewer as the principles of
                        international intercourse are better understood) rest on no broad principle
                        of comity; they violate comity, on the contrary, by asserting a painful
                        spirit of distrust. It is, as Mr. Dichman aptly expresses <pb n="545"
                            xml:id="pg_545" facs="0617"/>it in a dispatch of September 4, 1879 (<ref
                            target="frus1880#pg_313">Foreign Relations, 1880, page 313</ref>), much
                        as though it were regarded by the local authorities as a more effective
                        pledge to prevent a ship’s leaving a port to have material possession of her
                        register “than if the rudder had been unshipped.” The form in which this
                        distrust is expressed, moreover, seems to evidence a misapprehension as to
                        the nature and value of a ship’s register. As I have said above, the
                        register is the evidence of the ship’s nationality, and as such, with the
                        ship itself, are properly within the continuous jurisdiction of the vessel’s
                        nation, and, therefore, in a foreign port, within the jurisdiction of the
                        consul of that nation. I commend to your consideration Mr. Dichman’s
                        dispatches No. 62 of March 31, 1879 (<ref target="frus1879#pg_280">Foreign
                            Relations, 1879, p. 280</ref>), and No. 133 of September 4, 1879 (<ref
                            target="frus1880#pg_312">Foreign Relations, 1880, p. 312</ref>).</p>
                    <p>In the next place, a conclusive reason for the custody of a ship’s papers by
                        the consul of her nation is found in the necessity of preventing frauds
                        against individuals in connection with marine survey, repairs, bottomry
                        bonds, the right of absent owners, &amp;c., and protection of the rights of
                        seamen. It is for these purposes that the legislation of nations provides
                        that the register of a vessel while in port shall pass out of the control of
                        her commander and into the custody of the consul. It is not at all necessary
                        that these diversified rights should be subservient to the local police
                        surveillance while in a foreign port, and yet the rule existing in Venezuela
                        so subordinates them. Moreover, the exercise of these several rights over a
                        vessel for which the laws of her nation make abundant provision is rendered
                        almost impossible by the passage of the papers out of the control of the
                        nation to which the vessel belongs.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in your conversation with General Guzman Blanco, you have set forth
                        the considerations of convenience which should have weight in determining
                        the question. The loss of important ship’s papers while in foreign custody
                        has been only too common an occurrence in the countries where this obnoxious
                        regulation obtains. The correspondence with Colombia shows that this was
                        admitted as a powerful objection to the practice, and you can doubtless
                        adduce examples occurring in Venezuela to strengthen your point. I must
                        compliment you, too, on your aptness in meeting General Guzman Blanco’s
                        objection that if any feeling of distrust were shown in this matter, it lay
                        in an endeavor to take from the local officers the custody of a foreign
                        vessel’s papers. We do not seek to take from Venezuela a recognized right
                        because we distrust its exercise; we simply wish to retain for our own
                        consuls a right which we deem pertains to them as the representatives of our
                        national sovereignty, and one which is claimed and recognized as just among
                        maritime nations.</p>
                    <p>I infer from the request of General Guzman Blanco that he is not tenacious,
                        of the point but rather asks for so conclusive a statement of our position
                        as would warrant him in bringing the matter to the consideration of the
                        Venezuelan Congress, with a view to asking such modification of existing law
                        as will put Venezuelan legislation in this respect in harmony with the
                        legislation and usage of maritime countries throughout the world. You will,
                        therefore, in presenting to him a succinct memorandum founded on this
                        dispatch, set the question forth on its merits, as aiming to facilitate a
                        needed reform rather than as aggressively combating an assumed intent to
                        adhere to an obnoxious system.</p>
